In [[organic chemistry]], a '''carbamate''' is a category of [[organic compound]]s with the general [[Chemical formula|formula]] {{chem2|R2NC(O)OR}} and [[Chemical structure|structure]] {{chem2|>N\sC(\dO)\sO\s}}, which are formally [[Derivative (chemistry)|derived]] from [[carbamic acid]] ({{chem2|NH2COOH}}).  The term includes organic compounds (e.g., the [[ester]] [[ethyl carbamate]]), formally obtained by replacing one or more of the [[hydrogen]] atoms by other organic [[functional group]]s; as well as [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] with the carbamate [[anion]] {{chem2|H2NCOO-}} (e.g. [[ammonium carbamate]]).<ref name= Jäger>{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a05_051|title=Carbamates and Carbamoyl Chlorides |year=2000 |last1=Jäger |first1=Peter |last2=Rentzea |first2=Costin N. |last3=Kieczka |first3=Heinz |isbn=3-527-30673-0 }}</ref>

Polymers whose repeat units are joined by carbamate like groups {{chem2|\sNH\sC(\dO)\sO\s}} are an important family of [[plastic]]s, the [[polyurethane]]s. See Etymology for clarification.

==Properties==
While carbamic acids are unstable, many carbamate esters and [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] are stable and well known.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ghosh |first1=Arun K. |last2=Brindisi |first2=Margherita |date=2015-04-09 |title=Organic Carbamates in Drug Design and Medicinal Chemistry |journal=[[Journal of Medicinal Chemistry]]|language=en |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=2895–2940 |doi=10.1021/jm501371s |issn=0022-2623 |pmc=4393377 |pmid=25565044}}</ref>

===Equilibrium with carbonate and bicarbonate===
In water solutions, the carbamate anion slowly equilibrates with the [[ammonium]] {{chem|NH|4|+}} cation and the [[carbonate]] {{chem|CO|3|2-}} or [[bicarbonate]] {{chem|HCO|3|-}} anions:<ref name=burr1912>{{cite journal | last1 = Burrows | first1 = George H. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Gilbert N. | year = 1912 | title = The equilibrium between ammonium carbonate and ammonium carbamate in aqueous solution at 25° | url = https://zenodo.org/record/2430153| journal =[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]| volume = 34 | issue = 8| pages = 993–995 | doi = 10.1021/ja02209a003}}</ref><ref name = clark>{{cite journal | author1 = Clark, K.

Calcium carbamate is soluble in water, whereas [[calcium carbonate]] is not.  Adding a [[calcium]] salt to an ammonium carbamate/carbonate solution will precipitate some calcium carbonate immediately, and then slowly precipitate more as the carbamate hydrolyzes.<ref name=burr1912/>

==Synthesis==
===Carbamate salts===
The salt [[ammonium carbamate]] is generated by treatment of [[ammonia]] with [[carbon dioxide]]:<ref name="Brooks1946">{{cite book | author1 = Brooks, L. A. | author2 = Audrieta, L.

:2 NH<sub>3</sub>  +  CO<sub>2</sub>   →    NH<sub>4</sub>[H<sub>2</sub>NCO<sub>2</sub>]

===Carbamate esters===
Carbamate esters also arise via alcoholysis of [[carbamoyl chloride]]s:<ref name= Jäger/>
:R<sub>2</sub>NC(O)Cl + R'OH → R<sub>2</sub>NCO<sub>2</sub>R' + HCl
Alternatively, carbamates can be formed from [[chloroformate]]s and [[amine]]s:<ref name="Chaturvedi2011">{{cite journal | last=Chaturvedi | first=Devdutt | title=Recent Developments on the Carbamation of Amines | journal=[[Current Organic Chemistry]]| publisher=[[Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.]]| volume=15 | issue=10 | date=1 May 2011 | issn=1385-2728 | doi=10.2174/138527211795378173 | pages=1593–1624}}</ref>
:R'OC(O)Cl + R<sub>2</sub>NH → R<sub>2</sub>NCO<sub>2</sub>R' + HCl
Carbamates may be formed from the [[Curtius rearrangement]], where [[isocyanate]]s formed are reacted with an alcohol.<ref name="Chaturvedi2011"/>
:RCON<sub>3</sub> → RNCO + N<sub>2</sub>
:RNCO + R′OH → RNHCO<sub>2</sub>R′

==Natural occurrence==
Within nature carbon dioxide can bind with neutral amine groups to form a carbamate, this post-translational modification is known as carbamylation. This modification is known to occur on several important proteins; see examples below.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Linthwaite|first1=Victoria L.|last2=Janus|first2=Joanna M.|last3=Brown|first3=Adrian P.|last4=Wong-Pascua|first4=David|last5=O'Donoghue|first5=AnnMarie C.|last6=Porter|first6=Andrew|last7=Treumann|first7=Achim|last8=Hodgson|first8=David R.

===Hemoglobin===
The N-terminal amino groups of [[valine]] residues in the α- and β-chains of [[Hemoglobin|deoxyhemoglobin]] exist as carbamates. They help to stabilise the protein when it becomes deoxyhemoglobin, and increases the likelihood of the release of remaining [[oxygen]] molecules bound to the protein. This stabilizing effect should not be confused with the [[Bohr effect]] (an indirect effect caused by carbon dioxide).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=J. K. W.|last2=Roughton|first2=F. J. W.|date=1934-12-14|title=The direct chemical estimation of carbamino compounds of CO2 with hæmoglobin|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=68–86|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1934.sp003212|issn=0022-3751|pmc=1394306|pmid=16994615}}</ref>

===Urease and phosphotriesterase===
The ε-amino groups of the [[lysine]] residues in [[urease]] and [[phosphotriesterase]] also feature carbamate. The carbamate derived from aminoimidazole is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of [[inosine]]. Carbamoyl phosphate is generated from carboxyphosphate
rather than CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bartoschek|first1=S.|last2=Vorholt|first2=J. A.|last3=Thauer|first3=R. K.|last4=Geierstanger|first4=B.

===CO<sub>2</sub> capture by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase===
Perhaps the most prevalent carbamate is the one involved in the capture of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] by plants.  This process is necessary for their growth. The enzyme [[RuBisCO|ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase]] (RuBisCO) fixes a molecule of carbon dioxide as phosphoglycerate in the [[Calvin cycle]]. At the active site of the enzyme, a [[Magnesium|Mg<sup>2+</sup>]] ion is bound to [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] and [[aspartic acid|aspartate]] residues as well as a lysine carbamate. The carbamate is formed when an uncharged lysine [[side chain]] near the ion reacts with a carbon dioxide molecule from the air (''not'' the substrate carbon dioxide molecule), which then renders it charged, and, therefore, able to bind the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Crystal Structure of the Ternary Complex of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase, Mg(II), and Activator CO2 at 2.3-A Resolution|last1=T|first1=Lundqvist|last2=G|first2=Schneider|journal=[[Biochemistry (journal)|Biochemistry]]|date=1991-01-29|volume=30|issue=4|pages=904–8|doi=10.1021/bi00218a004|language=en|pmid=1899197}}</ref>

==Applications==
===Synthesis of urea===
Although not usually isolated as such, the salt [[ammonium carbamate]] is produced on a large scale as an intermediate in the production of the commodity chemical [[urea]] from [[ammonia]] and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name= Jäger/>

===Polyurethane plastics===
{{main|Polyurethane}}
[[Polyurethane]]s contain multiple carbamate groups as part of their structure. The "urethane" in the name "polyurethane" refers to these carbamate groups; the term "urethane links" describe how carbamates [[polymerize]].<sup>[Requires Citation]</sup> In contrast, the substance commonly called "urethane", [[ethyl carbamate]], is neither a component of polyurethanes, nor is it used in their manufacture.<sup>[Requires Citation]</sup> Urethanes are usually formed by reaction of an [[alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]] with an [[isocyanate]].<sup>[Requires Citation]</sup> Commonly, urethanes made by a non-isocyanate route are called [[carbamates]].<sup>[Requires Citation]</sup>

Polyurethane [[polymer]]s have a wide range of properties and are commercially available as foams, [[elastomers]], and solids. Typically, polyurethane polymers are made by combining diisocyanates, e.g. [[toluene diisocyanate]], and [[diol]]s, where the carbamate groups are formed by reaction of the alcohols with the [[isocyanate]]s:<ref>{{Ullmann |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_665.pub3 |title=Polyurethanes |year=2005 |last1=Adam |first1=Norbert |last2=Avar |first2=Geza |last3=Blankenheim |first3=Herbert |last4=Friederichs |first4=Wolfgang |last5=Giersig |first5=Manfred |last6=Weigand |first6=Eckehard |last7=Halfmann |first7=Michael |last8=Wittbecker |first8=Friedrich-Wilhelm |last9=Larimer |first9=Donald-Richard |last10=Maier |first10=Udo |last11=Meyer-Ahrens |first11=Sven |last12=Noble |first12=Karl-Ludwig |last13=Wussow |first13=Hans-Georg |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2 }}</ref>

===Carbamate insecticides===
[[File:Carbaryl-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|100 px|The carbamate insecticide [[Carbaryl]].]]
The so-called carbamate [[insecticide]]s feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included in this group are [[aldicarb]] ([[Temik]]), [[carbofuran]] (Furadan), [[carbaryl]] (Sevin), [[ethienocarb]], [[fenobucarb]], [[oxamyl]], and [[methomyl]]. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE inhibition)<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1567830|year=1990|last1=Fukuto|first1=T.

====Resistance====
Among [[insecticide resistance mutation|mutations]] in [[esterase]]s, carbamate resistance most commonly involves [[acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE) desensitization, while [[organophosphate resistance]] most commonly is [[carboxylesterase]] metabolization.<ref name="Comparing">{{cite journal|year=2005|publisher=[[Elsevier BV]]|last1=Oakeshott|first1=John|last2=Devonshire|first2=Alan|last3=Claudianos|first3=Charles|last4=Sutherland|first4=Tara|last5=Horne|first5=Irene|last6=Campbell|first6=Peter|last7=Ollis|first7=David|last8=Russell|first8=Robyn|pages=269–275|volume=157-158|journal=[[Chemico-Biological Interactions]]|issn=0009-2797|s2cid=32597626|pmid=16289012|doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2005.10.041|title=Comparing the organophosphorus and carbamate insecticide resistance mutations in cholin- and carboxyl-esterases}}</ref>

===Carbamate nerve agents===
While the carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are commonly referred to as "carbamate insecticides" due to their generally high selectivity for insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes over the mammalian versions, the most potent compounds such as [[aldicarb]] and [[carbofuran]] are still capable of inhibiting mammalian acetylcholinesterase enzymes at low enough concentrations that they pose a significant risk of poisoning to humans, especially when used in large amounts for agricultural applications. Other carbamate based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are known with even higher toxicity to humans, and some such as [[T-1123]] and [[EA-3990]] were investigated for potential military use as [[nerve agent]]s. However, since all compounds of this type have a [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium group]] with a permanent positive charge, they have poor [[blood–brain barrier]] penetration, and also are only stable as crystalline salts or aqueous solutions, and so were not considered to have suitable properties for weaponisation.<ref name="Handbook_of_Toxicology_of_Chemical_Warfare_Agents">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXKDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA338 | title=Handbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents | publisher=Academic Press | editor=Gupta, Ramesh C   | year=2015 | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States | pages=338–339 | isbn=978-0-12-800494-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Ellison | first=D | title=Handbook of chemical and biological warfare agents | publisher=CRC Press | publication-place=Boca Raton | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6 | oclc=82473582 }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the words "urethane" and "carbamate" are highly similar but not the same. The word "urethane" was first coined in 1833 by French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A dictionary of chemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |others=John Daintith |isbn=978-1-61583-965-0 |edition=6th |location=New York |oclc=713875281}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Dumas |first=Jean |date=1833 |title=Recherches de chimie organique |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEFRnP2_OmQC&q=j.+Dumas%2C+%27Recherches+de+chimie+organique%27&pg=PA499 |journal=[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]|series=2nd series |volume=56 |pages=496–556}}</ref> Dumas states "Urethane. The new ether, brought into contact with liquid and concentrated ammonia, exerts on this substance a reaction so strong that the mixture boils, and sometimes even produces a sort of explosion. If the ammonia is in excess, all the ether disappears. It forms ammonium hydrochlorate and a new substance endowed with interesting properties."<ref name=":1" /> Dumas appears to be naming this compound urethane. However, later Dumas states "While waiting for opinion to settle on the nature of this body, I propose to designate by the names of urethane and oxamethane the two materials which I have just studied, and <em>which I regard as types of a new family, among nitrogenous substances</em>. These names which, in my eyes, do not prejudge anything in the question of alcohol and ethers, will at least have the advantage of satisfying chemists who still refuse to accept our theory."<ref name=":1" /> The word urethane is derived from the words "urea" and "ether" with the suffix "-ane" as a generic chemical suffix, making it specific for the R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H) bonding structure.<ref>{{Cite web |title=urethane {{!}} Etymology, origin and meaning of urethane by etymonline |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/urethane |access-date=2023-03-29 |website=www.etymonline.com |language=en}}</ref>

The use of the word "carbamate" appears to come later only being traced back to at least 1849, in a description of Dumas's work by Henry Medlock.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Medlock |first=Henry |date=1849 |title=XXIX.—Researches on the amyl series |journal=[[Q. J. Chem. Soc.]]|volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=368–379 |doi=10.1039/qj8490100368 |issn=1743-6893|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2080479 }}</ref> Medlock states "It is well known that the action of ammonia on chloro-carbonate (phosgene) of ethyl gives rise to the formation of the substance which Dumas, the discoverer, called urethane, and which we are now in the habit of considering as the ether of carbamic acid."<ref name=":2" /> This suggests that instead of continuing with the urethane family naming convention Dumas coined, they altered the naming convention to ethyl ether of carbamic acid. Carbamate is derived from the words "carbamide", otherwise known as urea, and "-ate" a suffix which indicates the salt or ester of an acid.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Definition of CARBAMATE |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbamate |access-date=2023-03-29 |website=www.merriam-webster.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Divers |first=Edward |date=1870-01-01 |title=XXVII.—On the precipitation of solutions of ammonium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and ammonium carbamate by calcium chloride |url=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1870/js/js8702300359 |journal=[[Journal of the Chemical Society]]|language=en |volume=23 |pages=359–364 |doi=10.1039/JS8702300359 |issn=0368-1769}}</ref>

Both words have roots deriving from urea. Carbamate is less-specific because the -ate suffix is ambiguous for either the salt or ester of a carbamic acid. However, the -ate suffix is also more specific because it suggests carbamates must be derived from the acid of carbamate, or carbamic acids''.'' Although, a urethane has the same chemical structure as a carbamate ester moiety, a urethane not derived from a carbamic acid is not a carbamate ester. In other words, any synthesis of the R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H) moiety that ''does not derive from carbamic acids'' is not a carbamate ester but instead a urethane. Furthermore, carbamate esters are urethanes but not all urethanes are carbamate esters. This further suggests that polyurethanes are not simply polycarbamate-esters because polyurethanes are not typically synthesized using carbamic acids.

IUPAC states  "The esters are often called urethanes or urethans, a usage that is strictly correct only for the ethyl esters."<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Carbamates (C00803) |title=Goldbook |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/C00803 |access-date=2023-03-29 |publisher=IUPAC|doi=10.1351/goldbook.C00803 }}</ref> But also states, "An alternative term for the compounds R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H), esters of carbamic acids, R,NC(=O)OH, in strict use limited to the ethyl esters, but widely used in the general sense".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=G.
