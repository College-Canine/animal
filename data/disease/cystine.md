'''Cystine''' is the oxidized derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]] and has the [[chemical formula|formula]] (SCH<sub>2</sub>CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>. It is a white solid that is poorly soluble in water. As a residue in proteins, cystine serves two functions: a site of [[redox]] reactions and a mechanical linkage that allows proteins to retain their [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]].<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. (2000) ''Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry''. 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>

==Formation and reactions==
===Structure===
Cystine is the [[disulfide]] derived from the amino acid [[cysteine]]. The conversion can be viewed as an oxidation:
:{{chem2|2 HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH  +  0.5 O2  ->  (HO2CCH(NH2)CH2S)2  +  H2O}}
Cystine contains a [[disulfide bond]], two amine groups, and two carboxylic acid groups. As for other amino acids, the amine and carboxylic acid groups exist in rapid equilibrium with the ammonium-carboxylate [[tautomer]]. The great majority of the literature concerns the ''l,l-''cystine, derived from ''l''-cysteine. Other isomers include ''d,d''-cystine and the [[meso isomer]] d,l-cystine, neither of which is biologically significant.

=== Occurrence ===
Cystine is common in many foods such as eggs, meat, dairy products, and whole grains as well as skin, horns and hair. It was not recognized as being derived of [[proteins]] until it was isolated from the [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]] of a [[cow]] in 1899.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028437 "cystine"]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 27 July 2007</ref> Human hair and skin contain approximately 10–14% cystine by mass.<ref>{{OrgSynth | last1 = Gortner|first1=R.

Cystine was discovered in 1810 by the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]], who called it "cystic oxide".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wollaston |first1=William Hyde |title=On cystic oxide, a new species of urinary calculus |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1810 |volume=100 |pages=223–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/213300#page/293/mode/1up}} On p. 227, Wollaston named cystine "cystic oxide".</ref> <ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=Bradford Vickery |first=Hubert |title=The History of the Discovery of the Amino Acids II.

The history of cystine and [[cysteine]] is complicated by the dimer-monomer relationship of the two.<ref name=":0" /> The cysteine monomer was proposed as the actual unit by Embden in 1901.

The sulfur within the structure of cysteine and cystine has been subject of historical interest.<ref name=":0" />In 1902, Osborne partially succeeded in analysing cystine content via lead compounds. An improved colorimetric method was developed in 1922 by Folin and Looney. An iodometric analysis method was developed by Okuda in 1925.

===Redox===
It is formed from the oxidation of two cysteine molecules, which results in the formation of a [[disulfide bond]]. In cell biology, cystine residues (found in proteins) only exist in non-reductive (oxidative) organelles, such as the secretory pathway ([[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]], [[lysosome]]s, and vesicles) and extracellular spaces (e.g., [[extracellular matrix]]). Under reductive conditions (in the cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.) cysteine is predominant. The disulfide link is readily reduced to give the corresponding [[thiol]] [[cysteine]]. Typical thiols for this reaction are [[mercaptoethanol]] and [[dithiothreitol]]:
:(SCH<sub>2</sub>CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>  +  2 RSH  →  2 HSCH<sub>2</sub>CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>H  +  RSSR
Because of the facility of the thiol-disulfide exchange, the nutritional benefits and sources of cystine are identical to those for the more-common [[cysteine]]. Disulfide bonds cleave more rapidly at higher temperatures.<ref>{{cite journal

===Cystine-based disorders===
[[File:Urine crystals comparison.png|thumb|Comparison of different types of urinary crystals.]]
The presence of cystine in urine is often indicative of amino acid reabsorption defects. [[Cystinuria]] has been reported to occur in dogs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gahl|first1=William A.|last2=Thoene|first2=Jess G.|last3=Schneider|first3=Jerry A.|title=Cystinosis|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=347|issue=2|year=2002|pages=111–121|doi=10.1056/NEJMra020552|pmid= 12110740}}</ref>
In humans the excretion of high levels of cystine crystals can be indicative of [[cystinosis]], a rare genetic disease. Cystine stones account for about 1-2% of [[kidney stone disease]] in adults.<ref name=Frassetto2011>{{cite journal| author=Frassetto L, Kohlstadt I| title=Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update. | journal=Am Fam Physician | year= 2011 | volume= 84 | issue= 11 | pages= 1234–42 | pmid=22150656 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22150656  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cystine stones|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones|work=[[UpToDate]]|access-date=20 February 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226110022/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones|archive-date=26 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Biological transport==
Cystine serves as a substrate for the [[SLC7A11|cystine-glutamate antiporter]]. This transport system, which is highly specific for cystine and glutamate, increases the concentration of cystine inside the cell. In this system, the anionic form of cystine is transported in exchange for glutamate. Cystine is quickly reduced to cysteine.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Cysteine prodrugs, e.g. [[acetylcysteine]], induce release of glutamate into the extracellular space.

==Nutritional supplements==
{{missing|date=November 2022|reason='''hair growth supplements'''}}
Cysteine supplements are sometimes marketed as anti-aging products with claims of improved skin elasticity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Cysteine is more easily absorbed by the body than cystine, so most supplements contain cysteine rather than cystine. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is better absorbed than other cysteine or cystine supplements.
