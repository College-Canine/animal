'''Brodifacoum''' is a highly lethal [[4-Hydroxycoumarins|4-hydroxycoumarin]] [[vitamin K antagonist]] [[anticoagulant]] [[poison]]. In recent years, it has become one of the world's most widely used [[pesticides]]. It is typically used as a [[rodenticide]], but is also used to control larger pests such as [[common brushtail possum|possums]].<ref name="DoCManual">Eason, C.T. and Wickstrom, M. ''Vertebrate pesticide toxicology manual'', [[New Zealand Department of Conservation]]</ref>

Brodifacoum has an especially long half-life in the body, which ranges up to nine months, requiring prolonged treatment with antidotal [[vitamin K]] for both human and pet poisonings. It has one of the highest risks of [[secondary poisoning]] to both mammals and birds.<ref name="NPICRodenticides">[http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/rodenticides.html Rodenticides:  Topic Fact Sheet], [[National Pesticide Information Center]]</ref> Significant experience in brodifacoum poisonings has been gained in many human cases where it has been used in attempted suicides, necessitating long periods of vitamin K treatment. In March 2018, cases of severe [[coagulopathy]] and bleeding associated with [[synthetic cannabinoid]] use contaminated with brodifacoum were reported in five states of the US.

==Chemical synthesis==
Brodifacoum is a derivative of the 4-hydroxy-coumarin group. Compounds numbers are found next to their respective compounds in the image below. Compound 1 is the starting ester needed to synthesize brodifacoum. To obtain this starting Compound 1, a simple [[Wittig reaction|Wittig condensation]] of [[ethyl chloroacetate]] with 4’-bromobiphenylcarboxaldehyde is accomplished. Compound 1 is transformed into Compound 2 by consecutive [[hydrolysis]], [[halogenation]] to form an [[acid chloride]], and then reacted with the required [[lithium]] [[anion]]. This is done using KOH and EtOH for hydrolysis, and then adding SOCl<sub>2</sub> for chlorination to form the [[acid chloride]] which reacts with the addition of lithium anion. Compound 2 is then transformed using [[organocopper compound|organocopper]] chemistry to yield Compound 3 with good [[stereoselectivity]] of about 98%. Typically, a [[Friedel-Crafts]] type cyclization would then be used to obtain the two-ring system portion of Compound 4, but this results in low yield. Instead, [[trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] in dry [[benzene]] catalyzes the cyclization with good yield. The [[ketone]] is then reduced with [[sodium borohydride]] yielding a [[benzyl alcohol]]. Condensation with 4-hydroxycoumarin under HCl yields Compound 5, brodifacoum.<ref name="Synthesis of stereospecific Brodifacoum">{{citation |author1=van Heerden P. S. |author2=Bezuidenhoudt B. C. |journal=Tetrahedron|title=Efficient Asymmetric Synthesis of the Four Diastereomers of Diphenacoum and Brodifacoum|year=1997|volume=43|issue=17 |pages=6045–6056|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(97)00254-8}}</ref>

==Toxicology==
Brodifacoum is a [[4-hydroxycoumarin]] anticoagulant, with a similar mode of action to its historical predecessors [[dicoumarol]] and [[warfarin]]. However, due to very high potency and long duration of action (elimination [[half-life]] of 20 – 130 days), it is characterised as a "second-generation" or "[[superwarfarin]]" anticoagulant.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg093.htm |title=Brodifacoum (HSG 93, 1995) |publisher=Inchem.org |access-date=2013-12-08}}</ref>

Brodifacoum inhibits the [[enzyme]] [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]], which is needed for the reconstitution of the vitamin K in its cycle from vitamin K-epoxide, so brodifacoum steadily decreases the level of active vitamin K in the blood. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of important substances including [[prothrombin]], which is involved in [[blood clotting]]. This disruption becomes increasingly severe until the blood effectively loses any ability to clot.
 
In addition, brodifacoum (as with other anticoagulants in toxic doses) increases [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] of blood capillaries; the blood plasma and blood itself begin to leak from the smallest blood vessels. A poisoned animal suffers progressively worsening internal bleeding, leading to [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], loss of consciousness, and eventually [[death]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Brodifacoum is highly lethal to mammals and birds, and extremely lethal to fish. It is a highly [[bioaccumulation|cumulative]] poison, due to its high [[lipophilicity]] and extremely slow [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Human poisoning==
=== Treatment ===
The primary antidote to brodifacoum poisoning is immediate administration of [[vitamin K|vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]] (dosage for humans: initially slow intravenous injections of 10–25&nbsp;mg repeated at 3–6 hours until normalisation of the prothrombin time; then 10&nbsp;mg orally four times daily as a "maintenance dose"). It is an extremely effective antidote, provided the poisoning is caught before excessive bleeding ensues. As high doses of brodifacoum can affect the body for many months, the antidote must be administered regularly for a long period (several months, in keeping with the substance's half-life) with frequent monitoring of the [[prothrombin time]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17503253 | doi=10.1080/15563650701354093 | volume=45 | issue=5 | title=Brodifacoum poisoning with toxicokinetic data | year=2007 |vauthors=Olmos V, López CM | pages=487–9 | journal=Clin Toxicol| s2cid=33470724 }}</ref>

If unabsorbed poison is still in the digestive system, [[gastric lavage]] followed by administration of [[activated charcoal]] may be required.

Further treatments to be considered include infusion of [[blood]] or [[Blood plasma|plasma]] to counteract [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]], and in severe cases, infusion of [[Prothrombin complex concentrate|blood clotting factor concentrate]].

=== Case reports ===
Cases of brodifacoum intoxication have been reported in the human medical literature.

In one report, a woman deliberately consumed over 1.5&nbsp;kg (3 lb) of rat bait, constituting about 75&nbsp;mg brodifacoum, but made a full recovery after receiving conventional medical treatment.<ref name="LiptonKlass">{{cite journal |author1=Lipton R.A. |author2=Klass E.M. | year = 1984 | title = Human ingestion of a 'superwarfarin' rodenticide resulting in a prolonged anticoagulant effect | journal = [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | volume = 252 | issue = 21| pages = 3004–3005 | doi=10.1001/jama.252.21.3004|pmid=6502864 }}</ref>

In another case reported in 2013, a 48-year-old female patient reported 4 days of mild [[dyspnea]], dry cough, bilateral popliteal fossae pain, and diffuse upper abdominal pain. She had no history of liver disease or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[narcotic|illicit substance]] [[drug abuse|abuse]]. Initial physical examination was remarkable only for mildly pale [[conjunctivae]] and mild abdominal tenderness and pain in the left [[popliteal fossa]]. A complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were normal. [[Prothrombin]] time (PT) was above 100 s, partial [[thromboplastin]] time (PTT) was above 200 s and international normalized ratio (INR) was reported as above 12.0. Urinalysis revealed [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine). Venous [[Doppler ultrasound]] of lower extremities demonstrated left popliteal vein [[thrombosis]]. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated transmural hematoma, and a [[fecal occult blood test]] was positive. A full anticoagulant work-up showed critical reduction of vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X. PT and PTT corrected with mixing studies proving factor deficiency as the cause of the [[coagulopathy]]. [[Lupus anticoagulant]] studies were negative. Superwarfarin toxicity was suspected and confirmed with an anticoagulant poison panel positive for brodifacoum. The patient was hospitalized and successfully treated with fresh frozen plasma, [[cryoprecipitate]], and vitamin K. In conclusion, paradoxical thrombosis and hemorrhage should raise the suspicion for superwarfarin toxicity in the appropriate clinical setting. Concomitant presentation for thrombosis and hemorrhage with remarkably abnormal PT and PTT should raise the suspicion for brodifacoum poisoning.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = I smell a rat|journal = Blood Coagulation & Fibrinolysis|doi = 10.1097/mbc.0b013e328358e959|first1 = David|last1 = Franco|first2 = George|last2 = Everett|first3 = Manoucher|last3 = Manoucheri|year=2013|volume = 24|issue = 2|pages = 202–4|pmid = 23358203}}</ref>

In another report, a 17-year-old boy presented to the hospital with a severe bleeding disorder. He was found to have habitually smoked a mixture of brodifacoum and [[marijuana]]. Despite treatment with vitamin K, the bleeding disorder persisted for several months. He eventually recovered.<ref name="LaRosaEtAl">{{cite journal |author1=La Rosa F |author2=Clarke S |author3=Lefkowitz J B | year = 1997 | title = Brodifacoum intoxication with marijuana smoking | journal = Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine | volume = 121 | pages = 67–69 }}</ref>

In 2015, 19 [[inmate]]s in [[New York City]]'s [[Rikers Island]] jail claimed that they had been poisoned with the chemical. The inmates had noticed "what appeared to be blue and green pellets in the [[meatloaf]]" they were eating on March 3, and felt ill afterwards.

A 20-year-old female college student presented with abdominal pain and blood in urine. She was tested for [[warfarin]], a common anticoagulant also used in some rodenticides, which returned a negative result. Vitamin K and fresh [[Blood plasma|plasma]] were administered to treat symptoms. Three weeks later, she returned with bleeding into her calf, and was subsequently tested for superwarfarin chemicals. The test showed that brodifacoum was in her bloodstream. She later admitted to consuming seven packets of [[rodenticide]].<ref name="WeitzelEtAl">{{citation |author=Weitzel, J.

A 48-year-old businessman was admitted with a severe nosebleed and abnormal coagulation parameters. Standard treatment of vitamin K and fresh plasma was administered to stem the nosebleed. Two weeks later, he presented again with bleeding into the calf. Continual doses of vitamin K were necessary to counteract the brodifacoum. He denied taking any of the brodifacoum found in his home contained within packages of Contrac.<ref name="WeitzelEtAl"/>
