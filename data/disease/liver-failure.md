'''Liver failure'''  is the inability of the [[liver]] to perform its normal [[protein synthesis|synthetic]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions as part of normal [[Human body#Physiology|physiology]]. Two forms are recognised, [[Acute liver failure|acute]] and [[Cirrhosis|chronic]] (cirrhosis).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Grady JG, Schalm SW, Williams R |title=Acute liver failure: redefining the syndromes |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8866 |pages=273–5 |year=1993 |pmid=8101303 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91818-7|s2cid=21583699 }}</ref> Recently, a third form of liver failure known as '''acute-on-chronic liver failure''' ('''ACLF''') is increasingly being recognized.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1583287 | pmid=27172350 | volume=36 | issue=2 | title=Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure: A Distinct Clinical Condition | journal=Seminars in Liver Disease | pages=107–108| year=2016 | last1=Arroyo | first1=Vicente | last2=Kamath | first2=Patrick | last3=Moreau | first3=Richard | last4=Jalan | first4=Rajiv }}</ref>

== Acute ==
{{main article|Acute liver failure}}
[[Acute liver failure]] is defined as "the rapid development of [[Hepatocyte|hepatocellular]] dysfunction, specifically [[coagulopathy]] and mental status changes ([[hepatic encephalopathy|encephalopathy]]) in a patient without known prior liver disease".<ref name=Sleisenger>{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=edited by Mark Feldman, Lawrence S.

The disease process is associated with the development of a coagulopathy of liver [[Etiology|aetiology]], and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to [[hepatic encephalopathy]]. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention.<ref>{{cite web|title=EASL Clinical Practical Guidelines on the management of acute (fulminant) liver failure|url=http://www.easl.eu/medias/cpg/ALF/English-report.pdf|publisher=Journal of Hepatology|access-date=30 May 2017|archive-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024181850/http://www.easl.eu/medias/cpg/ALF/English-report.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> The diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on a physical exam, laboratory findings, patient history, and past medical history to establish mental status changes, coagulopathy, rapidity of onset, and absence of known prior liver disease respectively.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:1557</sup>

The exact definition of "rapid" is somewhat questionable, and different sub-divisions exist, which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy. One scheme defines "acute hepatic failure" as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms. This is sub-divided into "fulminant hepatic failure", which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks, and "subfulminant", which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks.<ref name=medscape>{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Gagan K|title=Acute Liver Failure|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/177354-overview|publisher=Mescape|access-date=14 December 2011}}</ref> Another scheme defines "hyperacute" as onset within 7 days, "acute" as onset between 7 and 28 days, and "subacute" as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks.<ref name=Sleisenger /><sup>:1557</sup>

== Chronic ==
{{main article|Chronic liver failure}}
Chronic liver failure usually occurs in the context of [[cirrhosis]], itself potentially the result of many possible causes, such as excessive [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] intake, [[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C|C]], autoimmune, hereditary and metabolic causes (such as [[hemochromatosis|iron]] or [[Wilson's disease|copper]] overload, [[steatohepatitis]] or [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]).{{cn|date=September 2022}}

==Acute on chronic==
"Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)" is said to exist when someone with [[chronic liver disease]] develops features of liver failure. A number of underlying causes may precipitate this, such as alcohol misuse or infection. People with ACLF can be critically ill and require [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care treatment]], and occasionally a liver transplant. Mortality with treatment is 50%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarin|first1=Shiv Kumar|last2=Choudhury|first2=Ashok|title=Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure|journal=Current Gastroenterology Reports|date=17 October 2016|volume=18|issue=12|doi=10.1007/s11894-016-0535-8|pmid=27747458|page=61|s2cid=29435525}}</ref>
