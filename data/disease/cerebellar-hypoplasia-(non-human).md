'''Cerebellar hypoplasia''' ('''CH''') is a neurological condition in which the [[cerebellum]] is smaller than usual or not completely developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Cerebellar-hypoplasia-Information-Page|title=Cerebellar Hypoplasia Information Page }}</ref>  It has been reported in many animal species.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/nervous-system/congenital-and-inherited-anomalies-of-the-nervous-system/congenital-and-inherited-cerebellar-disorders|title=Congenital and Inherited Cerebellar Disorders - Nervous System|website=Merck Veterinary Manual|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

== Function and development of the cerebellum ==
The cerebellum is the brain's main control center for planning, adjusting, and executing movements of the body, the limbs and the eyes. It plays a major role in several forms of motor learning, including balance and posture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Neural - Cerebellum Development|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Neural_-_Cerebellum_Development|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084330/https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Neural_-_Cerebellum_Development |archive-date=2015-05-18 }}</ref>

In the past, the evidence for a role for the cerebellum in cognitive functions was rather weak.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Glickstein M | title = What does the cerebellum really do? | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 19 | pages = R824-7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17925205 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.08.009 | s2cid = 14683993 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  However, investigations into the cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum are rapidly advancing, extending far beyond the traditional view. For humans, current theories support that what the cerebellum does to [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] and [[Vestibular system|vestibular control]], it also does to cognition, emotion, and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic function]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmahmann JD | title = The cerebellum and cognition | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 688 | pages = 62–75 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 29997061 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2018.07.005 | s2cid = 51623392 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Basson MA, Wingate RJ | title = Congenital hypoplasia of the cerebellum: developmental causes and behavioral consequences | journal = Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | volume = 7 | pages = 29 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24027500 | pmc = 3759752 | doi = 10.3389/fnana.2013.00029 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  How it functions in cognition, emotion, or autonomic function in animals is still largely unknown. In 2012, a  study in mice provided direct evidence that subtle disruptions in cerebellar architecture can have pronounced effects on behaviors typically associated with autistic-like behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai PT, Hull C, Chu Y, Greene-Colozzi E, Sadowski AR, Leech JM, Steinberg J, Crawley JN, Regehr WG, Sahin M | title = Autistic-like behaviour and cerebellar dysfunction in Purkinje cell Tsc1 mutant mice | journal = Nature | volume = 488 | issue = 7413 | pages = 647–51 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22763451 | pmc = 3615424 | doi = 10.1038/nature11310 | bibcode = 2012Natur.488..647T }}</ref>

Development of the cerebellum starts in a fetus in utero and, depending on the species, may continue for some period after birth. Postnatal development periods vary by species including: dogs up to 75 days, cats to 84 days, calves up to six months.<ref>{{cite book|title=Veterinary Neuroanatomy and Clinical Neurology|last1=DeLahunta|first1=Alexander|last2=Glass|first2=Eric | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=9780721667065 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pEWbeIU9-7QC&pg=PA5 |pages=348–350}}</ref>

== Causes ==
A hereditary link to CH has been established in some animals, including certain breeds of cows<ref name=":1" /> and dogs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/neurological/c_dg_cerebellar_hypoplasia|title=Brain Tissue Undervelopment in Dogs {{!}} petMD|website=www.petmd.com|access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref> 

There are numerous other potential causes for CH. It is suspected that the most common cause is animal [[Parvoviridae|parvoviruses.]]<ref>{{Citation|last1=Pattison|first1=John R.|title=Parvoviruses|date=1996|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7715/|work=Medical Microbiology|editor-last=Baron|editor-first=Samuel|edition=4th|place=Galveston (TX)|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|isbn=978-0-9631172-1-2|pmid=21413262|access-date=2021-05-02|last2=Patou|first2=Gary}}</ref>

[[Feline panleukopenia]] ("FPLV" {{aka}} Feline Distemper or Feline Parvo) virus has long been known to cause cerebellar hypoplasia in neonatal kittens through in utero or perinatal infection.<ref>{{cite book |title= Veterinary Neuroanatomy and Clinical Neurology |url= https://archive.org/details/veterinaryneuroa00phda |url-access= limited |last1=De Lahunta |first1=Alexander |last2=Glass |first2=Eric | name-list-style = vanc |year=2009 |isbn=9780721667065 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/veterinaryneuroa00phda/page/n322 348]–388 |chapter=Cerebellum|doi=10.1016/B978-0-7216-6706-5.00013-5}}</ref>  [[Uterus|In utero]], the virus can pass from the dam to the developing fetus and may then disrupt the development of its cerebellum by hindering cell division. This can happen when the dam is actively infected with the virus or given a modified-live FPV vaccine when pregnant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abcdcatsvets.org/abcd-guidelines-on-feline-panleukopenia-2012-edition/|title=Feline panleukopenia|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-01|archive-date=2019-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302024735/http://www.abcdcatsvets.org/abcd-guidelines-on-feline-panleukopenia-2012-edition/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kittens are particularly vulnerable to CH, in particular when the protective antibodies present in their mothers' milk are no longer present at four to twelve weeks of age. Unvaccinated adult cats are also prone to developing the condition.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Feline Parvovirus (FPV)|url=https://www.cats.org.uk/media/1034/vg05_feline_parvovirus_-fpv.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028112220/https://www.cats.org.uk/media/1034/vg05_feline_parvovirus_-fpv.pdf |archive-date=2020-10-28 }}</ref>

In most cases the cause is unknown. However, in dogs and cats it is thought to be most likely related to in utero viral infections, toxins or genetic disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.vin.com/apputil/content/defaultadv1.aspx?meta=&pId=11147&id=3846241|title=Cerebellar Diseases of Dogs and Cats|website=Vin.com|last=LeCouteur|first=Richard A. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2002|others=WSAVA 2002 Congress }}</ref>

Other possible causes, if they occurred during the development period of the cerebellum and inhibit its growth, include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/brain-cerebellar-disease|title=Brain: cerebellar disease |date=February 2019|website=Vet Stream| vauthors = Delauche A, Franklin R, Marsella R, Garosi L |issn=2398-2950 }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Numerous problems can be mistaken for CH. These include (but are not limited to):
* Ataxia: [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] or [[Sensory ataxia|sensory]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cat-world.com.au/ataxia-in-cats.html|title=Ataxia (Wobbly Gait) in Cats - Causes, Symptoms & Treatment - Cat World – Cat Health, Cat Care & Cat Advice|last=Wilson|first=Julia |date=7 March 2017| name-list-style = vanc |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
===Special considerations===
In 2004, a study was published that linked [[ketamine]] to post-anesthetic cerebellar dysfunction in cats.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shamir M, Goelman G, Chai O | title = Postanesthetic cerebellar dysfunction in cats | journal = Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 368–9 | date = May–Jun 2004 | pmid = 15188828 | doi = 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2004.tb02562.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> 11 cats that did not have any indication of cerebellar deficits before surgery developed deficits post-surgery. All of these cats were Persian crossbreeds. Ketamine can cause erratic and spastic, jerky movements and muscle tremors and is slow to be metabolized out of the system.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} The 2018 American Association of Feline Practitioner's Feline Anesthesia Guidelines<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catvets.com/guidelines/practice-guidelines/anesthesia-guidelines|title=Anesthesia Guidelines|publisher=American Association of Feline Practitioners|website=catvets.com|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref> lists numerous alternatives. Gas anesthesia offers a number of advantages in many circumstances. In CH cats the rapid recovery is its primary advantage.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

== Prognosis ==
If the root cause of the CH impacted other parts of the developing brain and/or body, the overall health and life-span may or may not be impacted. For instance, fetuses infected in utero by FPLV that survive, and kittens less than a few weeks of age that become infected with it, can also have [[retinal dysplasia]], and [[optic neuropathy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/infectious-diseases-of-the-dog-and-cat/greene/978-1-4160-6130-4|title=Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat |edition=4th |publisher=Elsevier |access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>
