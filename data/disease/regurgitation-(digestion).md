[[File:Flesh fly concentrating food.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Flesh fly]], from the family Sarcophagidae "blowing a bubble". One explanation for this behaviour is that it concentrates the fly's meal by the process of evaporation. The diet of the flesh fly is very high in water content. The fly regurgitates the liquid portion of the food, holds it while evaporation reduces the water content and the fly then swallows a much more concentrated meal without the water content. This continues until sufficient amount of liquid is left for the fly. – ''Australian Museum'']]

'''Regurgitation''' is the expulsion of material from the [[pharynx]], or [[esophagus]], usually characterized by the presence of undigested food or blood.<ref>Nelson, R.W. and C. G. Couto. Small Animal Internal Medicine, 4th ed. 2009.</ref>

Regurgitation is used by a number of species to feed their young.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keeling|first1=Linda K.|last2=Gonyou|first2=Harold W.|title=Social behaviour in farm animals|url=https://archive.org/details/socialbehaviorfa00keel|url-access=limited|year=2001|publisher=CABI Publishing|page=[https://archive.org/details/socialbehaviorfa00keel/page/n87 69]|isbn=0-85199-717-1}}</ref> This is typically in circumstances where the young are at a fixed location and a parent must forage or hunt for food, especially under circumstances where the carriage of small prey would be subject to robbing by other predators or the whole prey is larger than can be carried to a den or nest. Some bird species also occasionally regurgitate [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellets]] of indigestible matter such as bones and feathers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Birds: the inside story|first1=Rael|last1=Loon|first2=Hélène|last2=Loon|year=2005|publisher=Struik Publishers|page=183|isbn=1-77007-151-2}}</ref>

It is in most animals a normal and voluntary process unlike the complex [[vomiting]] reflex in response to toxins.

==Humans==
In humans it can be voluntary or involuntary, the latter being due to a small number of disorders. Regurgitation of a person's meals following ingestion is known as [[rumination syndrome]], an uncommon and often misdiagnosed motility disorder that affects eating. It may be a symptom of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rumination Syndrome|publisher=Mayo Clinic|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/rumination-syndrome/|access-date=Jan 26, 2011}}</ref>

In infants, regurgitation – or spitting up – is quite common, with 67% of 4-month-old infants spitting up more than once per day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hyman|first1=Paul E.|last2=Milla|first2=Peter J.|last3=Benninga|first3=Marc A.|last4=Davidson|first4=Geoff P.|last5=Fleisher|first5=David F.|last6=Taminiau|first6=Jan|date=April 2006|title=Childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders: neonate/toddler|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=130|issue=5|pages=1519–1526|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.065|issn=0016-5085|pmid=16678565|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Some people are able to regurgitate without using any external stimulation or drug, by means of muscle control. Practitioners of [[yoga]] have also been known to do this.<ref>Chari, C. T. K. (1973) '"Regurgitation, mediumship and yoga." ''Journal of the Society for Physical Research'' 47, 757, 156</ref> [[Professional regurgitator]]s perfect the ability to such a degree as to be able to exploit it as entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stevie Starr, Professional Regurgitator|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/comments/3985/|access-date=Jan 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chris Needs:Like It Is|last=Price|first=Haydn|year=2007|publisher=Y Lolfa Cyf|page=112|isbn=978-1-84771-015-4}}</ref>

==Birds==

For birds that transport food to their mates and/or their young over long distances — especially [[seabird]]s — it is impractical to carry food in their bills because of the risk that it would be stolen by other birds, such as [[frigatebird]]s, [[skua]]s and [[gull]]s. Such birds often employ a regurgitative feeding strategy. Many species of gulls have an orange to red spot near the end of the bill (called a "subterminal spot") that the chicks peck in order to stimulate regurgitation.

All of the [[Suliformes]] employ a regurgitative strategy to feed their young. In some species — such as the [[blue-footed booby]], [[masked booby]], and the [[Nazca booby]] —  a [[Dominance hierarchy#Brood hierarchy|brood hierarchy]] exists, in which the older chick is fed before the younger, subordinate chick. In times when food is scarce, [[siblicide]] may occur, where the dominant chick kills its younger sibling in order to sequester all of the resources of the parents.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drummond|first=Hugh |author2=Edda Gonzalez |author3=Jose Luis Osorno|title=Parent-Offspring Cooperation in the Blue-footed Booby (Sula nebouxii): Social Roles in Infanticidal Brood Reduction|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1986|volume=19|issue=5|pages=365–372|doi=10.1007/bf00295710|s2cid=36417383 }}</ref> Penguins chicks are fed regurgitated food by both parents.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ancel |first1=André |last2=Beaulieu |first2=Michaël |last3=Gilbert |first3=Caroline |date=2013-01-01 |title=The different breeding strategies of penguins: A review |url=https://comptes-rendus.academie-sciences.fr/biologies/item/10.1016/j.crvi.2013.02.002.pdf |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |language=en |volume=336 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2013.02.002 |pmid=23537764 |issn=1631-0691}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Janes |first=Donald N. |date=1997 |title=Osmoregulation by Adélie Penguin Chicks on the Antarctic Peninsula |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4089249 |journal=The Auk |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=488–495 |doi=10.2307/4089249 |jstor=4089249 |issn=0004-8038|doi-access=free }}</ref> Researchers found that the practice may potentially cause [[metabolic alkalosis]] in certain penguins.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sakamoto |first1=Kentaro Q. |last2=Sato |first2=Katsufumi |last3=Kato |first3=Akiko |last4=Fukui |first4=Daisuke |last5=Bando |first5=Gen |last6=Naito |first6=Yasuhiko |last7=Habara |first7=Yoshiaki |last8=Ishizuka |first8=Mayumi |last9=Fujita |first9=Shoichi |date=2013 |title=Metabolic alkalosis due to feeding chicks in breeding Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae under natural conditions |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19302032/ |journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=232–238 |doi=10.1086/597517 |issn=1537-5293 |pmid=19302032|hdl=2115/48302 |s2cid=18496199 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Some birds, such as [[fulmar]]s, employ regurgitation as a defense when threatened.

==Other animals==
[[Ruminant]]s regurgitate their food as a normal part of digestion. During their idle time, they chew the regurgitated food ([[cud]]) and swallow it again, which increases digestibility by reducing particle size.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

[[Honey]] is produced by a process of regurgitation by [[honey bee]]s, which is stored in the [[beehive]] as a primary food source.
