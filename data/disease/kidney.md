Each kidney is attached to a [[ureter]], a tube that carries excreted [[urine]] to the [[urinary bladder|bladder]].

The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various [[body fluid]]s, fluid [[osmolality]], [[Acid-base homeostasis|acid-base balance]], various [[electrolyte]] concentrations, and removal of [[toxins]]. Filtration occurs in the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]]: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free [[water]], [[sodium]], [[bicarbonate]], [[glucose]], and [[amino acid]]s. Examples of substances secreted are [[hydrogen]], [[ammonium]], [[potassium]] and [[uric acid]]. The [[nephron]] is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each adult human kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons. The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephrons. For example, they convert a precursor of [[vitamin D]] to its active form, [[calcitriol]]; and synthesize the [[hormone]]s [[erythropoietin]] and [[renin]].

[[Chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) has been recognized as a leading public health problem worldwide. The global estimated prevalence of CKD is 13.4%, and patients with [[kidney failure]] needing [[renal replacement therapy]] are estimated between 5 and 7 million.<ref name="Ji Cheng">{{cite book | vauthors = Lv JC, Zhang LX | title = Renal Fibrosis: Mechanisms and Therapies | chapter = Prevalence and Disease Burden of Chronic Kidney Disease | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 1165 | pages = 3–15 | year = 2019 | pmid = 31399958 | doi = 10.1007/978-981-13-8871-2_1 | isbn = 978-981-13-8871-2 | s2cid = 199519437 }}</ref> Procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine ([[urinalysis]]), measurement of [[kidney function]] by calculating the estimated [[glomerular filtration rate]] (eGFR) using the [[serum creatinine]]; and [[kidney biopsy]] and [[CT scan]] to evaluate for abnormal anatomy. [[Kidney dialysis|Dialysis]] and [[kidney transplantation]] are used to treat [[kidney failure]]; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15%.

The functional substance, or [[Parenchyma#Renal parenchyma|parenchyma]], of the human kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer [[renal cortex]] and the inner [[renal medulla]]. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped [[renal lobe]]s, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a [[renal pyramid]].<ref name="boron">{{cite book | vauthors = Boron WF |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4160-2328-9 }}</ref> Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called [[renal column]]s.

The tip, or [[renal papilla|papilla]], of each pyramid empties urine into a [[minor calyx]]; minor calyces empty into [[major calyces]], and major calyces empty into the [[renal pelvis]]. This becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes surround these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the [[renal sinus]]. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Clapp WL | chapter = Renal Anatomy | veditors = Zhou XJ, Laszik Z, Nadasdy T, D'Agati VD, Silva FG | title = Silva's Diagnostic Renal Pathology | location = New York| publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-521-87702-2 }}</ref>

The kidneys receive blood from the [[renal artery|renal arteries]], left and right, which branch directly from the [[abdominal aorta]]. The kidneys receive approximately 20–25% of [[cardiac output]] in adult human.<ref name="boron"/><ref>{{Citation |title=Urinary system |date=2015 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/design-of-mammals/urinary-system/E76848B86DA00C151DA92EDD8AB2F418 |work=The Design of Mammals: A Scaling Approach |pages=195–203 |editor-last=Prothero |editor-first=John William |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/CBO9781316275108.016 |isbn=978-1-107-11047-2 |access-date=2022-06-25 |archive-date=2018-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617094738/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/design-of-mammals/urinary-system/E76848B86DA00C151DA92EDD8AB2F418 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Martini |first1=Frederic |title=Human Anatomy |last2=Tallitsch |first2=Robert B. |last3=Nath |first3=Judi L. |publisher=Pearson |year=2017 |isbn=9780134320762 |edition=9th |pages=689}}</ref> Each renal artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into [[interlobar arteries]], which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between the renal pyramids. The interlobar arteries then supply blood to the [[arcuate arteries]] that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. Each arcuate artery supplies several [[interlobular]] arteries that feed into the [[afferent arteriole]]s that supply the glomeruli.

Blood drains from the kidneys, ultimately into the [[inferior vena cava]]. After filtration occurs, the blood moves through a small network of small veins ([[venules]]) that converge into [[interlobular veins]]. As with the arteriole distribution, the veins follow the same pattern: the interlobular provide blood to the [[arcuate veins]] then back to the [[interlobar veins]], which come to form the [[renal vein]]s which exit the kidney.

== Development ==
{{Main|Kidney development}}

The mammalian kidney develops from [[intermediate mesoderm]]. [[Kidney development]], also called ''nephrogenesis'', proceeds through a series of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.<ref>{{cite book |  vauthors = Carlson BM | title = Human Embryology and Developmental Biology | publisher = Mosby | location = Saint Louis | edition = 3rd | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-323-03649-8}}</ref>

== Function ==
[[File:Kidney Nephron.png|thumb|The [[nephron]], shown here, is the functional unit of the kidneys. Its parts are labelled except the (gray) ''connecting tubule'' located after the (dark red) distal convoluted tubule and before the large (gray) collecting duct (mislabeled ''collection'' duct).]]
{{main|Renal physiology}}

The kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by [[metabolism]] into the urine. The microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the [[nephron]]. It processes the blood supplied to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of [[urine]]. These include the nitrogenous wastes [[urea]], from protein [[catabolism]], and [[uric acid]], from [[nucleic acid]] metabolism. The ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate [[countercurrent multiplication]] mechanism. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. In addition, passive [[countercurrent exchange]] by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.

The kidney participates in whole-body [[homeostasis]], regulating [[acid–base balance]], [[electrolyte]] concentrations, [[extracellular fluid volume]], and [[blood pressure]]. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly those of the [[endocrine system]]. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include [[renin]], [[angiotensin II]], [[aldosterone]], [[antidiuretic hormone]], and [[atrial natriuretic peptide]], among others.

====Reabsorption====
[[File:2618 Nephron Secretion Reabsorption.jpg|thumb|Secretion and reabsorption of various substances throughout the nephron]]
Reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the peritubular capillary. It is accomplished via selective [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]]s on the luminal cell membrane. Water is 55% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism for this is the Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350&nbsp;mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.

Amino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule. [[Hartnup disease]] is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in [[pellagra]].<ref name="Tao p 1">Le, Tao. ''First Aid for the USMLE Step 1'' 2013.

====Secretion====
Secretion is the reverse of reabsorption: molecules are transported from the peritubular capillary through the interstitial fluid, then through the renal tubular cell and into the ultrafiltrate.

==== Excretion ====
The last step in the processing of the ultrafiltrate is ''excretion'': the ultrafiltrate passes out of the nephron and travels through a tube called the ''collecting duct'', which is part of the [[collecting duct system]], and then to the ureters where it is renamed ''urine''. In addition to transporting the ultrafiltrate, the collecting duct also takes part in reabsorption.

===Hormone secretion===
The kidneys secrete a variety of [[hormones]], including [[erythropoietin]], [[calcitriol]], and [[renin]]. [[Erythropoietin]] is released in response to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates [[erythropoiesis]] (production of red blood cells) in the [[bone marrow]]. [[Calcitriol]], the activated form of [[vitamin D]], promotes intestinal absorption of [[calcium]] and the renal [[reabsorption]] of [[phosphate]]. Renin is an [[enzyme]] which regulates [[angiotensin]] and [[aldosterone]] levels.

===Blood pressure regulation===
{{main|Blood pressure regulation|Renin–angiotensin system}}

Although the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long-term regulation of [[blood pressure]] predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the [[extracellular fluid]] compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma [[sodium]] concentration. Renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the [[renin–angiotensin system]]. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones [[angiotensin II]] and [[aldosterone]]. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of [[sodium chloride]], thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.

===Acid–base balance===
{{main|Acid–base homeostasis}}

The two organ systems that help regulate the body's acid–base balance are the kidneys and lungs. [[Acid–base homeostasis]] is the maintenance of [[pH]] around a value of 7.4. The lungs are the part of respiratory system which helps to maintain acid–base homeostasis by regulating [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration in the blood. The respiratory system is the first line of defense when the body experiences and acid–base problem. It attempts to return the body pH to a value of 7.4 by controlling the respiratory rate. When the body is experiencing acidic conditions, it will increase the respiratory rate which in turn drives off CO<sub>2</sub> and decreases the H<sup>+</sup> concentration, therefore increasing the pH. In basic conditions, the respiratory rate will slow down so that the body holds onto more CO<sub>2</sub> and increases the H<sup>+</sup> concentration and decreases the pH.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}

The kidneys have two cells that help to maintain acid-base homeostasis: intercalated A and B cells. The intercalated A cells are stimulated when the body is experiencing acidic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood creates a gradient for CO<sub>2</sub> to move into the cell and push the reaction HCO<sub>3</sub> + H ↔ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ↔ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O to the left. On the luminal side of the cell there is a H<sup>+</sup> pump and a H/K exchanger. These pumps move H<sup>+</sup> against their gradient and therefore require ATP. These cells will remove H<sup>+</sup> from the blood and move it to the filtrate which helps to increase the pH of the blood. On the basal side of the cell there is a HCO<sub>3</sub>/Cl exchanger and a Cl/K co-transporter (facilitated diffusion). When the reaction is pushed to the left it also increases the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration in the cell and HCO<sub>3</sub> is then able to move out into the blood which additionally raises the pH. The intercalated B cell responds very similarly, however, the membrane proteins are flipped from the intercalated A cells: the proton pumps are on the basal side and the HCO<sub>3</sub>/Cl exchanger and K/Cl co-transporter are on the luminal side. They function the same, but now release protons into the blood to decrease the pH.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}

=== Regulation of osmolality ===
The kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. Any significant rise in [[plasma osmolality]] is detected by the [[hypothalamus]], which communicates directly with the [[posterior pituitary gland]]. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.

===Measuring function===
{{main|Kidney function}}
Various calculations and methods are used to try to measure kidney function. [[Renal clearance]] is the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time. The [[filtration fraction]] is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through the kidney. This can be defined using the equation. The kidney is a very complex organ and [[mathematical model]]ling has been used to better understand kidney function at several scales, including fluid uptake and secretion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weinstein AM | title = Mathematical models of tubular transport | journal = Annual Review of Physiology | volume = 56 | pages = 691–709 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8010757 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.physiol.56.1.691 }}</ref><ref name=SRT>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas SR |title=Modelling and simulation of the kidney |journal=Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry |volume=5 |issue=2/3 |pages=70–83 |year=2005 |doi=10.4024/230503.jbpc.05.02}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
{{Main|Kidney disease}}
[[Nephrology]] is the subspeciality under [[Internal Medicine]] that deals with kidney function and disease states related to renal malfunction and their management including [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]] and kidney [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]]. [[Urology]] is the specialty under [[Surgery]] that deals with kidney structure abnormalities such as kidney [[cancer]] and [[cysts]] and problems with [[urinary tract]]. [[Nephrologists]] are [[internists]], and [[urologists]] are [[surgeons]], whereas both are often called "kidney doctors". There are overlapping areas that both [[nephrologists]] and [[urologists]] can provide care such as [[kidney stones]] and kidney related [[infections]].

There are many causes of [[kidney disease]]. Some causes are acquired over the course of life, such as [[diabetic nephropathy]] whereas others are [[congenital]], such as [[polycystic kidney disease]].

Medical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as ''renal'' and the prefix ''nephro-''. The [[adjective]] ''renal'', meaning related to the kidney, is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rēnēs'', meaning kidneys; the prefix ''nephro-'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for kidney, ''nephros (νεφρός)''.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Maton A, Hopkins J, McLaughlin CW, Johnson S, Warner MQ, LaHart D, Wright JD | title = Human Biology and Health | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1993 | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA | url = https://archive.org/details/humanbiologyheal00scho | isbn = 978-0-13-981176-0 | url-access = registration }}</ref> For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a ''[[nephrectomy]]'', while a reduction in kidney function is called ''renal dysfunction''.

===Acquired Disease===

*[[Diabetic nephropathy]]
*[[Glomerulonephritis]]
*[[Hydronephrosis]] is the enlargement of one or both of the kidneys caused by obstruction of the flow of urine.
*[[Interstitial nephritis]]
*[[Kidney stone]]s (nephrolithiasis) are a relatively common and particularly painful disorder. A chronic condition can result in scars to the kidneys. The removal of kidney stones involves [[ultrasound]] treatment to break up the stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract. One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the middle and sides of the lower back or groin.
*[[Kidney tumour]]
**[[Wilms tumor]]
**[[Renal cell carcinoma]]
*[[Lupus nephritis]]
*[[Minimal change disease]]
*In [[nephrotic syndrome]], the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]] has been damaged so that a large amount of [[protein]] in the blood enters the [[urine]]. Other frequent features of the nephrotic syndrome include swelling, low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.
*[[Pyelonephritis]] is infection of the kidneys and is frequently caused by complication of a [[urinary tract infection]].
*[[Kidney failure]]
** [[Acute kidney failure]]
** [[Chronic kidney disease|Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease]]
* [[Renal artery stenosis]]
* [[Renovascular hypertension]]

===Kidney injury and failure===
{{main|Acute kidney injury|Chronic kidney disease|Kidney failure}}

Generally, humans can live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished does one develop [[chronic kidney disease]]. [[Renal replacement therapy]], in the form of [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]] or [[kidney transplantation]], is indicated when the [[glomerular filtration rate]] has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalantar-Zadeh K, Jafar TH, Nitsch D, Neuen BL, Perkovic V | title = Chronic kidney disease | journal = Lancet | volume = 398 | issue = 10302 | pages = 786–802 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34175022 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00519-5 | s2cid = 235631509 | url = https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4663580/1/Kalantar-Zadeh_etal_2021-Preserving-Kidney-Function-in-People.pdf | access-date = 2022-05-22 | archive-date = 2022-05-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220517153016/https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4663580/1/Kalantar-Zadeh_etal_2021-Preserving-Kidney-Function-in-People.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Dialysis===
[[File:Peritoneal dialysis.jpg|thumb|258x258px|A depiction of [[peritoneal dialysis]]]]
{{main|Kidney dialysis}}
Dialysis is a treatment that substitutes for the function of normal kidneys. Dialysis may be instituted when approximately 85%–90% of kidney function is lost, as indicated by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 15. Dialysis removes metabolic waste products as well as excess water and sodium (thereby contributing to regulating blood pressure); and maintains many chemical levels within the body. Life expectancy is 5–10 years for those on dialysis; some live up to 30 years. Dialysis can occur via the blood (through a [[central venous catheter|catheter]] or [[arteriovenous fistula]]), or through the [[peritoneum]] ([[peritoneal dialysis]]) Dialysis is typically administered three times a week for several hours at free-standing dialysis centers, allowing recipients to lead an otherwise essentially normal life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dialysis|url=https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/dialysisinfo|website=National Kidney Foundation|access-date=8 November 2017|date=2015-12-24|archive-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926224542/https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/dialysisinfo|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Diagnosis ===
Many renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of a detailed [[medical history]], and [[physical examination]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaitonde DY |title=Chronic Kidney Disease: Detection and Evaluation |journal=Am Fam Physician |date=15 December 2017 |volume=12 |issue=96 |pages=776–783 |url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/1215/p776.html |access-date=1 March 2021 |archive-date=26 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226140126/https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/1215/p776.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The medical history takes into account present and past symptoms, especially those of kidney disease; recent infections; exposure to substances toxic to the kidney; and family history of kidney disease.

[[Renal function|Kidney function]] is tested by using [[blood test]]s and [[Clinical urine tests|urine tests]]. The most common blood tests are [[creatinine]], [[urea]] and [[electrolyte]]s. Urine tests such as [[urinalysis]] can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, and the presence of blood. Microscopic analysis can also identify the presence of [[urinary cast]]s and crystals.<ref name="uptodate.com"/> The [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) can be directly measured ("measured GFR", or mGFR) but this rarely done in everyday practice. Instead, special equations are used to calculate GFR ("estimated GFR", or eGFR).<ref>{{cite journal |title=KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease |journal=Kidney Int Suppl |date=2013 |volume=3 |pages=1–150 |url=https://kdigo.org/guidelines/ckd-evaluation-and-management/ |access-date=2021-01-25 |archive-date=2019-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501124111/https://kdigo.org/guidelines/ckd-evaluation-and-management/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="uptodate.com">{{cite web|vauthors= Post TW, Rose BD|veditors= Curhan GC, Sheridan AM|title= Diagnostic Approach to the Patient With Acute Kidney Injury (Acute Kidney Failure) or Chronic Kidney Disease|website= www.uptodate.com|date= December 2012|url= http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-or-chronic-kidney-disease|access-date= 2016-12-19|archive-date= 2015-11-10|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151110144346/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-or-chronic-kidney-disease|url-status= live}}</ref>

==== Biopsy ====
The role of the renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal [[pathologist]] is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.

Ideally, multiple core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli) intraoperatively. A pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s) for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy.

The pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H&E, PAS, trichrome, silver stain) on multiple level sections. Multiple immunofluorescence stains are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.

==Other animals==
{{Main|Kidney (vertebrates)}}
In the majority of vertebrates, the [[mesonephros]] persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced [[metanephros]]; only in [[amniote]]s is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of [[fish]] and [[amphibian]]s are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an ''archinephric duct'', which is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[vas deferens]] of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in [[cartilaginous fish]] and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the [[bladder]] or [[cloaca]]. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.<ref name=VB/>

In the most primitive vertebrates, the [[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s, the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the archinephric duct. Invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as "kidneys", but, even in ''[[Amphioxus]]'', these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately referred to by other names, such as [[nephridia]].<ref name=VB/> In [[amphibian]]s, kidneys and the [[urinary bladder]] harbour specialized [[parasite]]s, [[monogenea]]ns of the family Polystomatidae.<ref name=Theunissen>{{cite journal | vauthors = Theunissen M, Tiedt L, Du Preez LH | title = The morphology and attachment of Protopolystoma xenopodis (Monogenea: Polystomatidae) infecting the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis | journal = Parasite | volume = 21 | pages = 20 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24823278 | pmc = 4018937 | doi = 10.1051/parasite/2014020 }}</ref>

The kidneys of [[reptile]]s consist of a number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower [[metabolic rate]].<ref name=VB>{{cite book | vauthors = Romer AS, Parsons TS |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 367–376|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>

[[Bird]]s have relatively large, elongated kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. The lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred on a branch of the ureter. Birds have small glomeruli, but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.<ref name=VB/>

The human kidney is fairly typical of that of [[mammal]]s. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids and a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. The latter feature is due to the presence of elongated [[Loop of Henle|loops of Henle]]; these are much shorter in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates (although the nephron often has a short ''intermediate segment'' between the convoluted tubules). It is only in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed [[reniculate kidney]]s of [[pinniped]]s and [[cetacea]]ns.<ref name=VB/>

===Evolutionary adaptation===
Kidneys of various animals show evidence of evolutionary [[adaptation]] and have long been studied in [[ecophysiology]] and [[comparative physiology]].

===Significance===

====Egyptian====
In [[ancient Egypt]], the kidneys, like the heart, were left inside the mummified bodies, unlike other organs which were removed. Comparing this to the biblical statements, and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set of scales for weighing justice, it seems that the Egyptian beliefs had also connected the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions.<ref name="zzz">{{cite journal | vauthors = Salem ME, Eknoyan G | title = The kidney in ancient Egyptian medicine: where does it stand? | journal = American Journal of Nephrology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–147 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10213808 | doi = 10.1159/000013440 | s2cid = 35305403 }}</ref>

====Hebrew====
According to studies in modern and ancient Hebrew, various body organs in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role, today mostly attributed to the [[brain]] and the [[endocrine system]]. The kidney is mentioned in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart, much as the [[bowels]] were understood to be the "seat" of emotion – grief, joy and pain.<ref name="adath">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adath-shalom.ca/body_metaphors_bib_hebrew.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030322082801/http://www.adath-shalom.ca/body_metaphors_bib_hebrew.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 22, 2003|title=Body Part Metaphors in Biblical Hebrew by David Steinberg|date=March 22, 2003|access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref> Similarly, the [[Talmud]] (''Berakhoth'' 61.a) states that one of the two kidneys counsels what is good, and the other evil.

In the sacrifices offered at the biblical [[Tabernacle]] and later on at the temple in [[Jerusalem]], the priests were instructed<ref>Leviticus 3: 4, 10 and 15</ref> to remove the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep, goat and cattle offerings, and to burn them on the altar, as the holy part of the "offering for God" never to be eaten.<ref>ie Deut 3:4,9,10,15... or the Babylonian Talmud, Bechorot (39a) Ch6:Tr2...</ref>

====India: Ayurvedic system====
In ancient India, according to the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medical systems]], the kidneys were considered the beginning of the excursion channels system, the 'head' of the ''Mutra Srota''s, receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a person's health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three 'Dosha's – the three health elements: Vatha (or Vata) – air, Pitta – [[bile]], and Kapha – [[mucus]]. The temperament and health of a person can then be seen in the resulting color of the urine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ayurvedacollege.com/articles/drhalpern/Vata_Doshas|title=What is Vata Dosha?

====Medieval Christianity====
The Latin term ''renes'' is related to the English word "reins", a synonym for the kidneys in [[Shakespearean English]] (e.g. ''[[Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' 3.5), which was also the time when the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] was translated. Kidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the [[conscience]] and reflection,<ref>{{cite book |author3-link=William F.

The first to examine the ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was [[Hampton Young]] in 1929.<ref name="Tefekli2013" /> This was improved on by [[VF Marshall]] who is the first published use of a flexible [[endoscope]] based on [[fiber optics]], which occurred in 1964.<ref name="Tefekli2013" /> The insertion of a drainage tube into the [[renal pelvis]], bypassing the uterers and urinary tract, called [[nephrostomy]], was first described in 1941. Such an approach differed greatly from the [[open surgery|open surgical]] approaches within the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.<ref name="Tefekli2013" />
