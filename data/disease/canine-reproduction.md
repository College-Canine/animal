'''Canine reproduction''' is the process of [[sexual reproduction]] in [[domestic dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[coyote]]s and other [[Canis|canine]] species.

==Canine sexual anatomy and development==
===Male reproductive system===
[[File:Male_repro_system_labelled.jpg|thumb|Canine male reproductive system]]

====Erectile tissue====
As with all mammals, a dog's penis is made up of three pieces of [[erectile tissue]]. These are the two ''[[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]]'' and the singular ''[[Corpus spongiosum penis|corpus spongiosum]]'' which continues in the [[Glans penis|glans]]. A notable difference from the human penis is that the visible part during an erection consists entirely of the glans.

The [[Retractor muscle of the penis|retractor muscle]] is attached at the shaft of the penis. It is a paired [[smooth muscle]] that is used to retract the penis back into the [[Penile sheath|sheath]].
[[File:Animal castration - a book for the use of students and practitioners (1914) (14781607654).jpg|thumb]]
====Glans====
A dog's [[Glans penis|glans]] consists of two sections: Behind the lower, long part (''[[Glans penis#Other animals|pars longa glandis]]'') lies the "knot" (''[[Bulbus glandis]]'')<ref name="EvansLahunta2013" /> which expands only after penetrating the vagina and causes the male dog to remain inside the bitch ("Tie") for some time after [[ejaculation]] (typically between 15 and 30 min). This increases the chance of [[fertilisation]] and prevents, albeit for a short time, other suitors from mating with a particular female.

Behind the knot the penis is very flexible in the horizontal direction allowing the male to unmount while remaining tied.

====Shaft====
The shaft of a dogs penis is not visible, even during an erection; however its pathway can be felt starting at the knot passing between the hind legs and carrying on up to the anus.

====Baculum and urethra====
[[File:Armand de Montlezun Baculum Pyrénées.jpg|thumb|[[Baculum]] of a [[dog|domestic dog]]; The arrow points to the bottom groove where the [[urethra]] is located. The tip is to the right.]]
Inside the corpus spongiosum lies the [[baculum]]. This allows the male dog to enter into the vagina before the erectile tissue is swollen. The [[urethra]] is located inside of a downward facing groove on the baculum and ends at the tip of the penis (''urethral process'').

During an erection a small dip just above the urethral process can be seen. This is because the skin at the tip of the penis is connected via cartilage to the baculum. When the erectile tissue swells, the size of the baculum and connective tissue remains constant, pulling back the skin at the tip.

====Sheath====
The [[penile sheath]] entirely surrounds the glans while not erect. The back part is intergrown with the abdominal skin. The front part, almost reaching to the [[navel]], is free. The inner sheath, just like the glans, is covered with a [[mucous membrane]] and the outer sheath is covered with normal, hairy [[epidermis]].

===Development===
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity ([[puberty]]) occurs between the ages of 6 and 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive performance|url=https://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/fulldocs/MONONO5/Reproduc.htm|website=ilri|access-date=4 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901233915/http://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/fulldocs/MONONO5/Reproduc.htm|archive-date=1 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pregnancy is possible as soon as the first [[estrus cycle]], but breeding is not recommended prior to the second cycle.<ref name="breedcycle">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm|author=Bruce E.

==The female reproductive cycle==
[[File:The_anatomy_of_the_domestic_animals_(1914)_(18191869862).jpg|thumb|right|Canine female reproductive tract]]

===Female cycle===
The average length of the [[Reproduction|reproductive]] cycle for females is 2–4 weeks. Females reach sexual maturity (puberty) between 8 and 18&nbsp;months of age. There is a tremendous variability in the maturation age between breeds, and even within a breed of dog.<ref name="estrous">[http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421072006/http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm|date=2013-04-21}}, Dr B Eilts, LSU Veterinary Medicine, "The Normal Canine Estrous Cycle" retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref>

'''1. Proestrus''', in which eggs in the ovaries begin to mature and estrogen levels begin to rise, is the first stage of the reproductive cycle. During this stage females, though non-receptive, attract males. Initial changes include swelling of the vulva lips, which become pliable, small amounts of bloody vaginal discharge, frequent urination, and signs of restlessness. Proestrus generally lasts nine days.<ref name="estrous"/>

'''2. Estrus''' follows, in which estrogen levels are high, mature eggs are released from both ovaries, and females become receptive both physically and mentally to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]]. Only during estrus will copulation result in pregnancy.

During proestrus and estrus, females may have a clear, blood tinged, or bloody discharge. Dogs during these stages are often informally referred to as being in heat. The length of these cycles varies greatly among breeds and even between individuals of the same breed. Proestrus and estrus can last anywhere from 5 days to 21 days.<ref name="estrous" />

'''3. [[Diestrus]]''' is the period following mating. Diestrus lasts approximately 56 to 60 days in a pregnant female, and 60 to 100 days in a non-pregnant female. During both of these periods, progesterone levels are high. Because the hormonal profile of a pregnant female and a female in diestrus are the same, sometimes a non-pregnant female will go through a period of [[pseudopregnancy]].  At that time she may gain weight, have [[Breast development|mammary gland development]], produce milk, and exhibit nesting behaviours.

'''4. Anestrus''' is the remaining period, the time of reproductive quiescence. The female has no attraction to mating. Anestrus generally lasts four to five months.<ref name="estrous" />

As with most [[tetrapod]]s, canine [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] involves the male mounting the female from behind, a position that is colloquially referred to as "[[doggy style]]" but does not have a specifically known origin. When a male canine is interested in mounting a female, he will sniff the female's  [[vulva]], which, for females in the estrus stage, has been secreted with [[Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate]].<ref name="FeldmanNelson2004">{{cite book|author1=Edward C.

When the penis is locked into the vagina by the bulbus glandis (when the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] is "tied"), thrusting behavior stops and the male will usually lift a leg and swing it over the female's back while turning around.

Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation. Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period.<ref name="gestation">{{cite web |url=http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/canine_pregnancy.htm |title=Canine Pregnancy and Pseudo Pregnancy |access-date=2009-02-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403054137/http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/canine_pregnancy.htm |archive-date=2009-04-03 }}, Dr B Eilts, Louisiana State University Veterinary Medicine, "Canine Pregnancy" retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref> Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days <ref name="sperm sequestration">{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0378-4320(00)00130-5 | volume=60–61 | title=A glimpse at sperm function in vivo: sperm transport and epithelial interaction in the female reproductive tract | year=2000 | journal=Animal Reproduction Science | pages=337–348 | last1 = Scott | first1 = Mary A| pmid=10844205 }}</ref>  in the [[oviduct]]s (fallopian tubes) so if a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (eggs) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days.

During gestation, many physiological changes are similar to other mammals like humans. This results in similar shifts in nutrients in the blood of dogs, especially affecting [[glucose]], [[Fatty acid|fatty acids]] (like [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]) and [[amino acid]] (like [[Branched-chain amino acid|BCAA]]) levels.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Arlt |first1=Sebastian P. |last2=Ottka |first2=Claudia |last3=Lohi |first3=Hannes |last4=Hinderer |first4=Janna |last5=Lüdeke |first5=Julia |last6=Müller |first6=Elisabeth |last7=Weber |first7=Corinna |last8=Kohn |first8=Barbara |last9=Bartel |first9=Alexander |date=2023-05-10 |editor-last=Ölmez |editor-first=Mükremin |title=Metabolomics during canine pregnancy and lactation |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=e0284570 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0284570 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=10171673 |pmid=37163464 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

A rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on the mother.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yoon |first1=Carol Kaesuk |title=Of Breasts, Behavior and the Size of Litters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/19/science/of-breasts-behavior-and-the-size-of-litters.html |access-date=27 June 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 1999}}</ref> This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for economic reasons and in dogs, particularly, the great range of sizes and shapes plays a role in how many healthy puppies a female can carry.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} A female dog usually has 10 teats, though this does not mean she can necessarily provide sufficient nutrition for 10 puppies in one litter.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An average litter consists of about five to six [[puppy|puppies]], though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. Size of the breed is correlated with litter size. Miniature and small breeds average three to four puppies in each litter, with a maximum litter size of about 5–8. Large and giant breeds average 7 puppies per litter but can have a maximum litter size of about 15.<ref name="Borge">{{cite journal|last1=Borge|first1=K.

The number of puppies also varies with the mother's age. In smaller breeds, both young and old age are associated with smaller litter size. In larger breeds, only old age is associated with smaller litter size.<ref name="Borge"/> Use of artificial insemination is also associated with smaller litter size, with frozen semen having a stronger effect than fresh semen.<ref name="Borge"/>

The largest litter size to date was set by a [[Neapolitan Mastiff]] in [[Manea, Cambridgeshire|Manea]], England on November 29, 2004; the litter was 24 puppies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-litter-dog/ | title=Largest litter - dog}}</ref>

Some breeds have been developed to emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A large scale study in Norway showed that across all breeds, about 4% of pups will be stillborn and a further 4% will die within the first week (early neonatal mortality). Between 8 days and 8 weeks, 1% will die. Litter size, breed size and age of the female is associated with increased risk. High risk breeds for stillborn includes the Dogue de Bordeaux (14.2%), St. Bernard (12.3%), Chow Chow (12.1%), Pembroke Welsh Corgis (11.7%) and Dalmatian (10.6%). The Basenji, Italian Greyhound, Australian Terrier, Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and the Bichon Havanais had few to no stillborns (0-0.6%). High risk breeds for early neonatal mortality includes the Rhodesian Ridgeback (11.6%), Dogue de Bordeaux (10.4% ), Dalmatians (8.8%) and Icelandic Sheepdog (8.7%) while the Basenji and Tibetan Terrier had no early neonatal mortality and the Border Terrier and Danish-Swedish Farmdog had <1% early neonatal mortality.<ref name="Canine perinatal mortality">{{cite journal|last1=Tønnessen|first1=R.|last2=Borge|first2=K.

Common causes of early neonatal mortality are bacteria infection, fetal asphyxia and [[fading puppy syndrome]]. Other causes may include elective euthanasia because of congenital defects or failure to meet [[breed standards]].<ref name="Canine perinatal mortality"/>

===Inbreeding depression===

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Because the [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') largely exists in fragmented small populations, its existence is endangered.  [[Inbreeding avoidance]] via mate selection is characteristic of the species and has important potential consequences for population persistence.<ref name=Becker>{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker PA, Miller PS, Gunther MS, Somers MJ, Wildt DE, Maldonado JE |title=Inbreeding avoidance influences the viability of reintroduced populations of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e37181 |year=2012 |pmid=22615933 |pmc=3353914 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037181 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...737181B |doi-access=free }}</ref>  Inbreeding is rare within natal packs.  Computer-population simulations indicate that all populations continuing to avoid incestuous mating will become extinct within 100 years due to the unavailability of unrelated mates.<ref name=Becker />  Thus the impact of reduced numbers of suitable unrelated mates will likely have a severe demographic impact on the future viability of small wild dog populations.

[[Red wolf|Red wolves]] primarily live in packs composed of a socially [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] breeding pair and offspring of different ages.  Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare.<ref name=Sparkman>{{cite journal | last1 = Sparkman | first1 = AM | last2 = Adams | first2 = JR | last3 = Steury | first3 = TD | last4 = Waits | first4 = LP | last5 = Murray | first5 = DL | date = July 2012 | title = Pack social dynamics and inbreeding avoidance in the cooperatively breeding red wolf | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 1186–1194 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/ars099 | doi-access = free | hdl = 10.1093/beheco/ars099 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>  A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation.<ref name=Sparkman />

Among [[Ethiopian wolf|Ethiopian wolves]], most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age, and some become "floaters" that may successfully immigrate into existing packs.  Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Randall | first1 = DA | last2 = Pollinger | first2 = JP | last3 = Wayne | first3 = RK | last4 = Tallents | first4 = LA | last5 = Johnson | first5 = PJ | last6 = Macdonald | first6 = DW | year = 2007 | title = Inbreeding is reduced by female-biased dispersal and mating behavior in Ethiopian wolves | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 579–89 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arm010 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Clinical issues==

Female dogs are at risk for [[endometritis]] and [[pyometra]] in the [[postpartum]] period and after [[estrus]] or [[vaginitis]]. Signs and symptoms include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, restlessness, a foul smelling vaginal discharge which may or may not be bloody, infertility, or they may be asymptomatic.

Contrary to common belief, uterine infections can strike any intact female, whether she has been bred or not, and whether it is her first season or not although it is more common as dogs become older.

==={{anchor|Procedure}}Semen collection===
An [[Artificial vagina#Veterinary use|artificial vagina]] is prepared, which is a conical thin latex sleeve ending in a sterile collection tube. The inside of the latex sleeve is lightly lubricated.  The male is allowed to sniff a female in estrus. Experienced studs cooperate readily in the process. New studs often require encouragement in the form of manual stimulation.<ref name="Veterinary Medicine">{{cite book|title=Veterinary Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8kmAQAAMAAJ&q=masturbation|access-date=9 February 2013|year=1989|publisher=Veterinary Medicine Publishing Company}}</ref> Generally the male will mount the female, and the collector quickly directs the male's penis into the latex sleeve. The male [[ejaculation|ejaculates]] and the [[semen collection|semen is collected]] in the tube. The semen is then drawn up into a long thin pipette.<ref name = "collection">{{cite web|url=http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/dog.html|title=Semen Collection from Dogs|publisher=Arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu|date=2002-09-14|access-date=2012-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205044421/http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/dog.html|archive-date=2012-02-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Cross breeding==
Designer breed dogs are [[mixed-breed dogs]] intentionally bred from parents of two established breeds.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Studies have shown that cross-bred dogs have a number of desirable reproductive traits. Scott and Fuller<ref name="scott">{{cite book|title=Dog Behavior|url=https://archive.org/details/dogbehaviorgenet00scot|url-access=registration|author1=John Paul Scott |author2=John L. Fuller |year=1974|isbn=9780226743387}}</ref> found that cross-bred females were superior mothers compared to purebred females, producing more milk and giving better care. These advantages led to decreased mortality in the offspring; however, the qualities of such dogs are not predictable.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} For example, Labrador x Poodle ("[[Labradoodle]]") can inherit the coat of either a Labrador, a poodle, or a remix.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Spaying and neutering==
{{Main|Neutering}}
Spaying (females) and neutering (males) refers to the [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of animals—usually by castration (removal of the male's [[testicle]]s) or ovariohysterectomy (removal of the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]])—to eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce [[sex drive]]. Castration has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs (in some cases), but spaying has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Heidenberger E, Unshelm J |title=[Changes in the behavior of dogs after castration]|language=de|journal=Tierärztliche Praxis|volume=18|issue=1|pages=69–75|year=1990|pmid=2326799}}</ref>

Animal control agencies in the United States and the [[ASPCA]] advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/top-10-reasons-spay-or-neuter-your-pet|title=Top 10 reasons to spay or neuter your pet|publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|access-date=2013-12-09<!-- page archived at archive.is on 9 Dec 2013 -->}}</ref>  Spaying and castrating can decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors.<ref name=":0" />  However, certain medical problems are more likely after neutering, such as [[urinary incontinence]] in females<ref>{{cite journal|author=Arnold S|title=[Urinary incontinence in castrated bitches. Part 1: Significance, clinical aspects and etiopathogenesis]|language=de|journal=Schweiz. Arch.

Dogs shown in the [[conformation show|conformation ring]] are not allowed to be either neutered or spayed. It disqualifies them from being shown as they must be intact and unaltered.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

{{anchor|Altered Females}}
'''Altered females:'''

Increased aggression can be shown in altered females if they have previously displayed aggression prior to surgical alteration. In a study by O'Farrell and Peachy, female dogs less than 11 months of age that had previously shown signs of aggression are more likely to have an increase in aggression after being spayed.<ref name= "Beaver1999">{{cite journal|author=Bonnie Beaver|title=Canine Behavior: A Guide for Veterinarians|year=1999}}</ref> These increases in aggression may be due to the sudden change in hormone concentrations that are the result of alteration. While spaying female dogs does not "induce" aggression, it can increase aggression and facilitate indiscriminate appetite in young altered females and can include them rapidly eating meals or eating food-associated items such as trash.<ref name="Beaver1999"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Peter Borchelt|title=Aggressive Behavior of dogs kept as companion animals: Classification and influence of sex, reproductive status and breed|journal=Applied Animal Ethology|volume=10|issue=1 & 2|pages=45–61|year=1983|doi=10.1016/0304-3762(83)90111-6|doi-access=free}}</ref>

'''Altered males:'''

In nearly 2/3 of the cases that involve inter-dog aggression, castration can help decrease aggression. Castration also decreases other male-typical behavioral traits such as mounting, roaming, and urine marking. But a few studies have shown that male behavioral issues of mounting, roaming and urine marking still exist in altered males.  Some people have reported after altering their male dogs that behavior such as roaming, mounting and urine marking has not changed the behavior.  Aggression may increase, as the decrease in testosterone may lead to emotional issues and become more likely to react aggressively when feeling under threat.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apbc.org.uk/articles/neuteringmaledogs | title=Articles | access-date=2016-12-03 | archive-date=2016-12-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202170933/http://www.apbc.org.uk/articles/neuteringmaledogs | url-status=dead }}</ref> Male puppies that are neutered between 7 and 10 weeks are three times less likely to display behavioral problems, compared to canines neutered at 6 months or older.<ref name= "O'Farrel1990">{{cite journal|author1=V.

Removing testosterone can decrease the intensity of a canine's reaction to stimulus. Testosterone does not cause a behavior to occur, but its absence may decrease the occurrence of a "bad" behavior.<ref name="O'Farrel1990"/>
