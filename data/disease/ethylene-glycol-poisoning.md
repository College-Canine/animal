<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Ethylene glycol poisoning''' is [[poisoning]] caused by drinking [[ethylene glycol]].<ref name=Kr2012/> Early symptoms include [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[vomiting]] and [[abdominal pain]].<ref name=Kr2012/> Later symptoms may include a [[decreased level of consciousness]], [[headache]], and [[seizures]].<ref name=Kr2012/> Long term outcomes may include [[kidney failure]] and [[brain damage]].<ref name=Kr2012/> Toxicity and death may occur after drinking even in a small amount<ref name=Kr2012/> as ethylene glycol is more toxic than other [[Diol|diols]]. 

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, commonly found in [[antifreeze]].<ref name=Kr2012/> It may be drunk accidentally or intentionally in a [[suicide attempt]].<ref name=EM2016/> When broken down by the body it results in [[glycolic acid]] and [[oxalic acid]] which cause most of the toxicity.<ref name=Kr2012/><ref name=Fer2016/> The diagnosis may be suspected when [[calcium oxalate crystals]] are seen in the urine or when [[acidosis]] or an increased [[osmol gap]] is present in the blood.<ref name=Kr2012/> Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many [[hospital]]s do not have the ability to perform this test.<ref name=Kr2012>{{cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=JA|title=Methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication.|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=661–711|pmid=22998995|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.002}}</ref>

<!-- Treatment -->
Early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome.<ref name=EM2016/> Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an [[antidote]].<ref name=EM2016/> The preferred antidote is [[fomepizole]] with [[ethanol]] used if this is not available.<ref name=EM2016/> [[Hemodialysis]] may also be used in those where there is [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage or a high degree of [[acidosis]].<ref name=EM2016/> Other treatments may include [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[thiamine]], and [[magnesium]]{{clarification needed|reason=magnesium in what form?|date=November 2023}}.<ref name=EM2016>{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=GA|last2=Valento|first2=M|title=Toxic Alcohol Ingestion: Prompt Recognition And Management In The Emergency Department.|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1–20|pmid=27538060}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion.<ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/> Symptoms usually follow a three-step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent">{{cite journal | author = Brent J | s2cid= 22954381| author-link= Jeffrey Brent| title = Current management of ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Drugs | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 979–88 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11434452 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200161070-00006 | issn = 0012-6667 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hess|first1=R|last2=Bartels|first2=MJ|last3=Pottenger|first3=LH|s2cid=19995896|title=Ethylene glycol: an estimate of tolerable levels of exposure based on a review of animal and human data.|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=December 2004|volume=78|issue=12|pages=671–80|pmid=15372138|doi=10.1007/s00204-004-0594-8|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/311781/files/204_2004_Article_594.pdf}}</ref>
* Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of [[neurological]] and [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s and looks similar to alcohol poisoning.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Poisoned individuals may appear to be [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]], [[dizziness|dizzy]], [[ataxia|lacking coordination of muscle movements]], [[drooling]], [[depression (mood)|depressed]],<ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/> and have [[slurred speech]], [[seizure]]s, [[pathologic nystagmus|abnormal eye movements]], [[headache]]s, and [[confusion]].<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Irritation to the stomach may cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Also seen are excessive thirst and urination.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Over time, the body [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] ethylene glycol into other toxins.
* Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of "alcohol" poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> An [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[hyperventilation]] or increased breathing effort, and [[dehydration]] may start to develop, along with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> These symptoms are a result of accumulation of [[organic acid]]s formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally [[hypocalcemia|low calcium concentrations in the blood]], [[hyperreflexia|overactive muscle reflexes]], [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[QT interval]] prolongation, and [[congestive heart failure]] may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>
* Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after consuming antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after consuming antifreeze.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to [[calcium oxalate]] crystals forming in the kidneys.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and [[Anorexia (symptom)|inappetence]] may be seen.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Other symptoms include [[acute tubular necrosis]], [[hematuria|red blood cells in the urine]], [[proteinuria|excess proteins in the urine]], [[lower back]] pain, [[oliguria|decreased]] or [[anuria|absent]] production of urine, [[hyperkalemia|elevated blood concentration of potassium]], and [[acute kidney failure]].<ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barceloux DG, Krenzelok EP, Olson K, Watson W | title=American Academy of Clinical Toxicology Practice Guidelines on the Treatment of Ethylene Glycol Poisoning.

==Sources==
The most common source of ethylene glycol is automotive [[antifreeze]] or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/>  Other sources of ethylene glycol include windshield [[deicing]] agents, [[brake fluid]], [[motor oil]], [[Photographic processing|developing solutions]] for hobby photographers, [[Wood stain|wood stains]], solvents, and paints.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Some people put antifreeze into their cabin's toilet to prevent it from freezing during the winter, resulting in toxicities when animals drink from the toilet.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> Small amounts of ethylene glycol may be contained in holiday ornaments such as [[snow globes]].<ref name="Pet poison help line"/>

The most significant source of ethylene glycol is from [[Ice protection system|aircraft de-icing]] and anti-icing operations, where it is released onto land and eventually to waterways near [[Airport|airports]] experiencing cold winter climates.<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/> It is also used in manufacturing [[polyester]] products.<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/> In 2006, approximately 1540 kilotonnes of ethylene glycol were manufactured in [[Canada]] by three companies in [[Alberta]], with most of the production destined for export.<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/>

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Glycolic acid3d.png|thumb|right|[[Glycolic acid]] is the major metabolite of ethylene glycol responsible for toxicity]]
The three main systems affected by ethylene glycol poisoning are the [[central nervous system]], [[metabolic]] processes, and the [[kidney]]s.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The central nervous system is affected early in the course of poisoning as the result of a direct action of ethylene glycol. Similar to [[ethanol]], it causes intoxication, followed by [[drowsiness]] or [[coma]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> [[Seizure]]s may occur due to a direct effect.<ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/> The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is [[metabolized]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] to [[glycolaldehyde]], which is then oxidized to [[glycolic acid]] by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>  

The increase in metabolites may cause [[encephalopathy]] or [[cerebral edema]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maier W |title=Cerebral computed tomography of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6828232 |doi= 10.1007/BF00347839 |s2cid=9038812 |issn=0028-3940|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00347839}}</ref> The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily [[metabolic acidosis]] which is due mainly to accumulated glycolic acid. Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of [[lactic acid]] occurs contributing to [[lactic acidosis]]. The formation of acid metabolites also causes inhibition of other [[metabolic pathway]]s, such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent" />

The kidney toxicity of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and is caused by a direct [[cytotoxic]] effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to [[glyoxylic acid]] and finally to [[oxalic acid]]. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form [[calcium oxalate]] crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to [[oliguric]] or [[Anuria|anuric]] [[acute kidney failure]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid.<ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R |title=Organic acids in ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=16–20 |date=July 1986 |pmid=3717806 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-105-1-16|issn=0003-4819}}</ref> Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clay KL, Murphy RC |title=On the metabolic acidosis of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=[[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |date=January 1977 |pmid=14421 |doi= 10.1016/0041-008X(77)90175-2|issn=0041-008X }}</ref>

=== Toxicity ===

A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg [[body weight]] (mL/kg) of [[Chemical substance|pure substance]]. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&nbsp;kg adult and 4 mL for a 20&nbsp;kg child. [[Poison control center]]s often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.<ref name="Caravati"/>

The orally [[lethal dose]] in humans has been reported as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&nbsp;kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20&nbsp;kg child.

Ethylene glycol has a low [[vapor pressure]]; it does not [[evaporate]] readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hodgman MJ, Wezorek C, Krenzelok E |title=Toxic inhalation of ethylene glycol: a pharmacological improbability |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=109–11 |year=1997 |pmid=9022663 |doi=10.3109/15563659709001176  }}</ref> There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wills JH, Coulston F, Harris ES, McChesney EW, Russell JC, Serrone DM |title=Inhalation of aerosolized ethylene glycol by man |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=463–76 |year=1974 |pmid=4613525 |doi= 10.3109/15563657408988020|issn=0009-9309}}</ref> Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through [[Human skin|skin]] meaning poisoning following [[dermal]] exposure is also uncommon.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Driver J, Tardiff RG, Sedik L, Wester RC, Maibach HI |title=In vitro percutaneous absorption of [14C] ethylene glycol |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=277–84 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8260837 |issn=1053-4245 }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Calcium oxalate crystals in urine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Urine microscopy showing [[calcium oxalate]] crystals in the urine]]

As many of the [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings; the diagnosis is often difficult.<ref name="Hall TL">{{cite journal |author=Hall TL |title=Fomepizole in the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Canadian Journal of Emergency Medical Care |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=199–204 |date=May 2002 |pmid=17609006 |doi=10.1017/s1481803500006382 |s2cid=6058769 |url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |issn=1481-8035 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727062918/http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-27 }}</ref> It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the [[Blood plasma|blood]] ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by [[gas chromatography]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aarstad K, Dale O, Aakervik O, Ovrebø S, Zahlsen K |title=A rapid gas chromatographic method for determination of ethylene glycol in serum and urine |journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8371550 |doi= 10.1093/jat/17.4.218|issn=0146-4760 }}</ref> Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this [[blood test]] and in the absence of this test the diagnosis must be made based on the presentation of the person.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> 

In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the [[osmol gap|osmolal gap]]. The person' serum [[osmolality]] is measured by [[freezing point depression]] and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the person's measured [[sodium]], [[glucose]], [[blood urea nitrogen]], and any [[ethanol]] that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.<ref name="Jacobsen" /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffman RS, Smilkstein MJ, Howland MA, Goldfrank LR |title=Osmol gaps revisited: normal values and limitations |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |year=1993 |pmid=8433417 |doi=10.3109/15563659309000375 |issn=0731-3810 }}</ref>

The increased osmolal gap is caused by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Glaser DS |title=Utility of the serum osmol gap in the diagnosis of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=343–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8599495 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(96)70271-8|issn=0196-0644}}</ref> Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], or [[methanol]] or conditions such as [[Ketoacidosis|alcoholism]] or [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[lactic acidosis]], or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>

Other laboratory abnormalities may suggest poisoning, especially the presence of a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large [[anion gap]]. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of [[differential diagnoses]], including poisoning from methanol, [[salicylate]]s, [[Iron poisoning|iron]], [[isoniazid]], [[paracetamol]], [[theophylline]], or from conditions such as [[uremia]] or diabetic and [[alcoholic ketoacidosis]]. 

The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any people with a severe acidosis.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent" /> Urine [[microscopy]] can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, Akesson I, Shefter E |title=Urinary calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=231–4 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7134806 |doi= 10.3109/00365518209168078|issn=0036-5513}}</ref> Finally, many commercial radiator [[antifreeze]] products have [[fluorescein]] added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a [[Wood's lamp]].

==Prevention==
Antifreeze products for automotive use containing [[propylene glycol]] in place of ethylene glycol are available, and are generally considered safer to use, as it possesses an unpleasant taste in contrast to the perceived "sweet" taste of toxic ethylene glycol-based coolants, and produces only [[lactic acid]] in an animal's body, as their muscles do when exercised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |title=Ethylene Glycol Poisoning |author=Pieter Klapwijk |date=January 27, 2010 |publisher=The Rested Dog Inn |access-date=October 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126003300/http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |archive-date=January 26, 2013 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}

When using antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol, recommended safety measures include:
* Cleaning up any spill immediately<ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/> and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material directly on the spill.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/> Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/> The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/> The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/>
* Checking vehicles regularly for leaks.<ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/>
* Storing antifreeze in clearly marked original sealed containers, in areas that are inaccessible to pets<ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/> or small children.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/>
* Keeping pets and small children away from the area when draining the car radiator.<ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/>
* Disposing of used antifreeze only by taking to a service station.<ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/>
* If antifreeze is placed in toilets, ensuring the lid is down and the door closed.<ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/>

== Treatment ==

=== Stabilization and decontamination ===
The most important initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the person. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, [[gastric]] decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, [[gastric lavage]] or [[nasogastric aspiration]] of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vale JA, Kulig K |s2cid=29957973 |title=Position paper: gastric lavage |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=933–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15641639 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200045006 |issn=0731-3810 }}</ref> [[Syrup of ipecac|Ipecac]]-induced [[vomiting]] is not recommended. As [[activated charcoal]] does not [[adsorb]] glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> It is only used in the presence of a toxic dose of another poison or drug.<ref name="Jacobsen">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, McMartin KE |title=Antidotes for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=127–43 |year=1997 |pmid=9120880 |doi=10.3109/15563659709001182 |issn=0731-3810}}</ref> People with significant poisoning often present in a [[Medical state|critical condition]]. In this situation [[ABC (medicine)|stabilization]] of the person including [[airway management]] with [[endotracheal intubation|intubation]] should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> People presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with [[sodium bicarbonate]] and anticonvulsives such as a [[benzodiazepine]] respectively.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen [[hypocalcemia]] by increasing the [[plasma protein binding]] of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage.<ref name="Hall TL"/> [[Intubation]] and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated people; people with [[hypotension]] require treatment with [[intravenous]] fluids and possibly [[vasopressor]]s.<ref name="Brent-2009"/>

=== Antidotes ===
Following decontamination and the institution of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using [[antidote]]s. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are [[ethanol]] and [[fomepizole]]. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning.  The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid.  The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites.  Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH), the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. Because ethanol has nearly 100 times more affinity for ADH, it blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, thus preventing further degradation to oxalic acid and the associated nephrotoxic effects. The unreacted ethylene glycol remains in the body and is eventually excreted in the urine; however, supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits.  Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% [[dextrose]], but it is also sometimes given orally in the form of a strong spirit such as [[whisky]], [[vodka]], or [[gin]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>

Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block the formation of the toxic metabolites.<ref name="Hall TL"/><ref name="Brent-2009">{{cite journal |author=Brent J |s2cid=33354715 |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=21 |pages=2216–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19458366 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806112 |issn=0028-4793}}</ref><ref name="NEJM-Brent">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent J, McMartin K, Phillips S, Burkhart K, Donovan J, Wells M, Kulig K | title = Fomepizole for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning.

People therefore must be monitored in an [[intensive care unit]]. Alternatively, the adverse [[adverse effect|side effects]] of fomepizole are minimal{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive.

Adjunct agents including [[thiamine]] and [[pyridoxine]] are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as those who are malnourished or [[alcoholic]].<ref name="Hall TL"/>

=== Hemodialysis ===
In addition to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning is the use of [[hemodialysis]]. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It has been shown to be highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood.<ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreau CL, Kerns W, Tomaszewski CA, McMartin KE, Rose SR, Ford MD, Brent J |title=Glycolate kinetics and hemodialysis clearance in ethylene glycol poisoning.

Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> If hemodialysis is not available, then [[peritoneal dialysis]] also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aakervik O, Svendsen J, Jacobsen D |title=[Severe ethylene glycol poisoning treated with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole)] |language=no |journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske Lægeforening |volume=122 |issue=25 |pages=2444–6 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12448112 |issn=0029-2001 }}</ref>

Ethylene glycol involved in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations is released onto land and eventually to waterways.<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/> A report prepared for the World Health Organization in 2000 stated that laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have shown toxic effects and death (p.&nbsp;12).<ref name="WHO Report"/> Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity, although those effects could not definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol (p.&nbsp;12).<ref name="WHO Report"/> The process of biodegrading of glycols also increases the risk to organisms, as oxygen levels become depleted in surface waters (p.&nbsp;13).<ref name="WHO Report"/> Another study found the toxicity to aquatic and other organisms was relatively low, but the oxygen-depletion effect of biodegradation was more serious (p.&nbsp;245).<ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/> Further, "Anaerobic biodegradation may also release relatively toxic byproducts such as acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, and methane (p. 245)."<ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/>

In Canada, [[Environment Canada]] reports that "in recent years, management practices at Canada’s major airports have improved with the installation of new ethylene glycol application and mitigation facilities or improvements to existing ones."<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/> Since 1994, federal airports must comply with the Glycol Guidelines of the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999|Canadian Environmental Protection Act]], monitoring and reporting on concentrations of glycols in surface water.<ref>[https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&n=FD028E79-1 "Glycol Guidelines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913080539/https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&n=FD028E79-1 |date=2014-09-13 }}, Government of Canada, Environment Canada, Jan. 20, 1994.</ref> Detailed mitigation plans include storage and handling issues (p.&nbsp;27), spill response procedures, and measures taken to reduce volumes of fluid (p.&nbsp;28).<ref name="Canadian glycol mitigation at airports"/> Considering factors such as the "seasonal nature of releases, ambient temperatures, metabolic rates and duration of exposure", [[Environment Canada]] stated in 2014 that "it is proposed that ethylene glycol is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity".<ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/>

In the U.S., airports are required to obtain [[stormwater]] discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated.<ref name="US airport deicing"/> Large new airports may be required to collect 60 percent of aircraft [[deicing fluid]] after deicing.<ref name="US airport deicing"/> Airports that discharge the collected aircraft [[deicing fluid]] directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for [[chemical oxygen demand]].<ref name="US airport deicing"/> A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.&nbsp;213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.&nbsp;I-3).<ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/>

==Other animals==
Once kidney failure has developed in dogs and cats, the outcome is poor.<ref name="Pet poison help line"/> The treatment is generally the same, although [[vodka]] or [[rectified spirit]]s may be substituted for pharmaceutical grade ethanol in IV injections.<ref>[https://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/blog/antifreeze-poisoning-vodka-antidote/ ANTIFREEZE POISONING… VODKA AS AN ANTIDOTE?].
