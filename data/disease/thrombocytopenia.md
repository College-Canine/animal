Thrombocytopenia usually [[asymptomatic|has no symptoms]] and is picked up on a routine [[complete blood count]]. Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding, such as [[nosebleed]]s or bleeding [[gums]]. Some women may have heavier or longer [[menstruation|periods]] or breakthrough bleeding. [[Bruising]], particularly [[purpura]] in the forearms and [[petechia]]e in the feet, legs, and [[mucous membranes]], may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin.<ref name="BTP_Report">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~sg4187/Platelet.pdf|title=B.E.

Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not secondary to another disorder. Ensuring that the other blood cell types, such as [[red blood cells]] and [[white blood cells]], are not also suppressed, is also important.<ref name=BTP_Report />
Painless, round, and pinpoint (1 to 3&nbsp;mm in diameter) petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form [[ecchymoses]]. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue, or yellow-green areas of skin that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body.<ref name=BTP_Report />

A person with this disease may also complain of [[malaise]], [[fatigue]], and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). Acquired thrombocytopenia may be associated with the use of certain drugs. Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (petechiae or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled [[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]] in the mouth.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcARTQwHLpIC&pg=PA293 | title=Interpreting Signs and Symptoms | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year=2007 | page=293| isbn=9781582556680 }}</ref> If the person's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/μL, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/μL, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Textbook of Basic Nursing|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=odY9mXicPlYC&q=thrombocytopenia++signs+fatigue&pg=PA1256|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year = 2008|access-date = 2015-05-01|isbn = 9780781765213| vauthors = Rosdahl CB, Kowalski MT }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

Laboratory tests for thrombocytopenia might include [[full blood count]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[kidney function]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels, folic acid levels, [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], and peripheral blood smear. If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a [[bone marrow biopsy]] is usually recommended to differentiate cases of decreased platelet production from cases of peripheral platelet destruction.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How Is Thrombocytopenia Diagnosed? |url = http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thcp/diagnosis | work = National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date = 2015-05-19}}</ref>

Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by [[splenomegaly|spleen enlargement]], [[folate deficiency]], and most frequently, the direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medical and Nutritional Complications of Alcoholism: Mechanisms and Management|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KkL0BwAAQBAJ&q=alcoholics+thrombocytopenia&pg=PA264|publisher = Springer Science & Business Media|year = 2012|isbn = 9781461533207|language = en| vauthors = Lieber CS }}</ref> Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days' abstinence from alcohol. The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow study can determine the number, size, and maturity of the [[megakaryocyte]]s. This information may identify ineffective platelet production as the cause of thrombocytopenia and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis: Clinical and Laboratory Aspects|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cGBaz0hp_fcC&q=thrombocytopenia+++diagnosis&pg=PA489|publisher = Elsevier|year = 2009|access-date = 2015-05-01|isbn = 9780080922300| vauthors = Hillyer CD, Abrams CS, Shaz BH, Roshal M, Zimring JC, Abshire TC }}</ref>

==Treatment==

Treatment is guided by the severity and specific cause of the disease. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing drugs suspected to cause it or treating underlying sepsis.  Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a [[hematologist]]. [[Corticosteroids]] may be used to increase platelet production. [[Lithium carbonate]] or folate may also be used to stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Essentials of General Surgery|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LNapiMBi_csC&q=Thrombotic+thrombocytopenic+purpura+treatment+corticosteroids&pg=PA439|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|date = 2012-10-31|isbn = 9780781784955|language = en| vauthors = Lawrence PF, Bell RM, Dayton MT }}</ref>

=== Platelet transfusions ===
[[Platelet transfusion]]s may be suggested for people who have a low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Estcourt LJ, Malouf R, Hopewell S, Doree C, Van Veen J | title = Use of platelet transfusions prior to lumbar punctures or epidural anaesthesia for the prevention of complications in people with thrombocytopenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = CD011980 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29709077 | pmc = 5957267 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011980.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group }}</ref>

===Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura===
Treatment of [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP) is a medical emergency, since the associated [[hemolytic anemia]] and platelet activation can lead to kidney failure and changes in the level of consciousness.  Treatment of TTP was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of [[plasmapheresis]].  According to the [[Furlan–Tsai hypothesis]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman K, Seldon M, Richards R | title = Thrombotic microangiopathies, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and ADAMTS-13 | journal = Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–54 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22314603 | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1300951 | doi-access = free }}</ref> this treatment works by removing [[antibodies]] against the [[von Willebrand factor]]-cleaving [[protease]] [[ADAMTS13|ADAMTS-13]]. The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease [[proteins]] to the patient, restoring a normal level of von Willebrand factor multimers.  Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain how plasmapheresis treats TTP.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How Is Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Treated? | work = National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ttp/treatment |access-date = 2015-05-20}}</ref>

===Immune thrombocytopenic purpura===
{{Main|Immune thrombocytopenic purpura}}
[[File:Oral petechiae.JPG|thumb|Oral petechiae/purpura - immune thrombocytopenic purpura]]
Many cases of [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP), also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, can be left untreated, and spontaneous remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts under 50,000/μL are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts under 10,000/μL are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such low platelet counts. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; [[hematologist]]s recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000/μL, although exceptions to this observation have been documented.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Thrombocytopenic Purpura: New Insights for the Healthcare Professional: 2013 Edition: ScholarlyPaper|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x-RMkItgNWQC&pg=PA7 |publisher = ScholarlyEditions|date = 2013-07-22|isbn = 9781481662420|language = en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) | encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine |url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000535.htm |access-date = 2015-05-20}}</ref>

Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP.  These agents had previously shown promise, but had been found to stimulate antibodies against [[endogenous]] [[thrombopoietin]] or lead to [[thrombosis]]. [[Romiplostim]] (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who [[relapse]]d following splenectomy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Nplate (romiplostim) for subcutaneous injection|url = https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/ucm182233.htm|website = www.fda.gov|access-date = 2015-05-02}}</ref>

===Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia===
{{main|Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia}}
Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid thrombosis.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=79OEYE4RnRQC&pg=PA1E|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2007-07-23|isbn = 9781439826423|language = en| vauthors = Warkentin TE, Greinacher A }}</ref> Treatment may include a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]], such as [[lepirudin]] or [[argatroban]]. Other "[[blood thinners]]" sometimes used in this setting include [[bivalirudin]] and [[fondaparinux]].

===Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia===
Bone marrow/stem cell transplants are the only known cures for this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death before the transplant can be performed, although this is not always the case.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Neonatology and Blood Transfusion|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wBjr7pkmNSIC&pg=PA48|publisher = Springer Science & Business Media|date = 2010-05-10|isbn = 9780387236001|language = en | vauthors = Smit-Sibinga CH }}</ref>

==Neonatal thrombocytopenia==
Thrombocytopenia affects a few newborns, and its prevalence in neonatal intensive care units <!-- (NICU) --> is high. Normally, it is mild and resolves without consequences. Most cases affect preterm birth infants and result from placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. Other causes, such as alloimmunity, genetics, autoimmunity, and infection, are less frequent.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts I, Murray NA | title = Neonatal thrombocytopenia: causes and management | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood.
