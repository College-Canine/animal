'''Serum albumin''', often referred to simply as '''blood albumin''', is an [[albumin]] (a type of globular [[protein]]) found in vertebrate [[blood]]. [[Human serum albumin]] is encoded by the ''ALB'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid6292049">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkins JW, Dugaiczyk A | title = The human serum albumin gene: structure of a unique locus | journal = Gene | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–8 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6292049 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(82)90188-3 }}</ref><ref name="pmid6192711">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harper ME, Dugaiczyk A | title = Linkage of the evolutionarily-related serum albumin and alpha-fetoprotein genes within q11-22 of human chromosome 4 | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 565–72 | date = July 1983 | pmid = 6192711 | pmc = 1685723 }}</ref><ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: albumin| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=213 | work = U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref> Other [[mammal]]ian forms, such as [[bovine serum albumin]], are chemically similar.

Serum albumin is produced by the [[liver]], occurs dissolved in [[blood plasma]] and is the most abundant [[blood protein]] in [[mammal]]s. Albumin is essential for maintaining the [[oncotic pressure]] needed for proper distribution of [[body fluid]]s between blood vessels and body tissues; without albumin, the high pressure in the blood vessels would force more fluids out into the tissues. It also acts as a plasma carrier by non-specifically binding several [[hydrophobic]] [[steroid hormones]] and as a transport protein for [[hemin]] and [[fatty acid]]s. Too much or too little circulating serum albumin may be harmful. Albumin in the urine usually denotes the presence of kidney disease. Occasionally albumin appears in the urine of normal persons following long periods of standing ([[postural albuminuria]]).

== Function ==
Albumin functions primarily as a carrier protein for [[steroid]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and [[thyroid hormone]]s in the blood and plays a major role in stabilizing extracellular fluid volume by contributing to [[oncotic pressure]] (known also as colloid osmotic pressure) of plasma.

Because smaller animals (for example [[rat]]s) function at a lower [[blood pressure]], they need less oncotic pressure to balance this{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, and thus need less albumin to maintain proper fluid distribution.

As an anionic protein, albumin binds readily to calcium in blood serum and contributes greatly to plasma calcium levels.  As such, in clinical applications it is necessary to adjust serum total calcium concentration upward or downward if [[hypoalbuminemia]] or [[hyperalbuminemia]] is present, respectively (measured serum total calcium decreases by 0.8 mg/dL per unit decrease in albumin concentration below 4 g/dL).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Goyal A, Anastasopoulou C, Ngu M, Singh S| chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430912/ | chapter = Hypocalcemia | title = StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing LLC |date=8 May 2022 | pmid = 28613662 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://acpinternist.org/archives/2012/03/hypercalcemia.htm | vauthors = Holliman K |title=Diagnosing a disorder with few symptoms |website=ACP Internist |publisher=American College of Physicians |date=March 2012 |access-date=13 June 2022}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Albumin is synthesized in the [[liver]] as preproalbumin which has an [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi vesicle]]s to produce the secreted albumin.<ref name="entrez"/>

== Properties ==
Albumin is a globular, water-soluble, un-[[glycosylation|glycosylated]] serum protein of approximate molecular weight of 65,000 [[Dalton (unit)|dalton]]s.

Albumin (when ionized in water at pH 7.4, as found in the body) is negatively charged. The [[glomerular basement membrane]] is also negatively charged in the body; some studies suggest that this prevents the filtration of albumin in the urine. According to this theory, that charge plays a major role in the selective exclusion of albumin from the glomerular filtrate. A defect in this property results in [[nephrotic syndrome]] leading to albumin loss in the urine. Nephrotic syndrome patients are sometimes given albumin to replace the lost albumin.

== Structure ==
{{main|Albumin}}
The general structure of albumin is characterized by several long [[alpha helix|α helices]] allowing it to maintain a relatively static shape, which is essential for regulating blood pressure.

Serum albumin contains eleven distinct binding domains for hydrophobic compounds. One [[hemin]] and six long-chain [[fatty acid]]s can bind to serum albumin at the same time.<ref name="pmid12846933">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zunszain PA, Ghuman J, Komatsu T, Tsuchida E, Curry S | title = Crystal structural analysis of human serum albumin complexed with hemin and fatty acid | journal = BMC Structural Biology | volume = 3 | pages = 6 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12846933 | pmc = 166163 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6807-3-6 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Types ==
Serum albumin is widely distributed in mammals.  
* The human version is [[human serum albumin]]. 
* [[Bovine serum albumin]], or BSA, is commonly used in immunodiagnostic procedures, clinical chemistry reagents, cell culture media, protein chemistry research (including venom toxicity), and [[molecular biology]] laboratories (usually to leverage its non-specific protein binding properties).
