{{short description|Malformations of the cervical vertebrae in dogs and horses}}
'''Wobbler disease''' is a catchall term referring to several possible malformations of the [[cervical vertebrae]] that cause an unsteady (wobbly) gait and weakness in [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s. A number of different conditions of the cervical (neck) spinal column cause similar clinical signs. These conditions may include malformation of the vertebrae, [[intervertebral disc]] protrusion, and disease of the [[interspinal ligament]]s, [[ligamenta flava]], and [[articular facet]]s of the vertebrae.<ref name=NAVC>{{cite web | last = Bagley | first = Rodney S. | title = Acute Spinal Disease | work = Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference | date = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/247.pdf?LA=1 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-02-19 }}</ref> Wobbler disease is also known as cervical vertebral instability (CVI), cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM), and cervical vertebral malformation (CVM). In dogs, the disease is most common in large breeds, especially [[Great Dane]]s and [[Doberman Pinscher]]s. In horses, it is not linked to a particular breed, though it is most often seen in tall, race-bred horses of [[Thoroughbred]] or [[Standardbred]] ancestry. It is most likely inherited to at least some extent in dogs and horses.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

The spinal-cord hyperintensity seen at the C5-C6 is suggestive of chronic lesion and most likely responsible for the chronic history of cervical pain, while the C5-C6 lesion was most likely responsible for the acute tetraplegia.

The disease tends to be gradually progressive. Symptoms such as weakness, [[ataxia]], and dragging of the toes start in the rear legs. Dogs often have a crouching stance with a downward flexed neck. The disease progresses to the front legs, but the symptoms are less severe. Neck pain is sometimes seen.

==Wobbler disease in horses==
Wobbler disease or wobbler's syndrome is a broad category of cervical disorders in the horse, including the conditions listed above, as well as [[equine wobbles anemia]] and [[cervical vertebral myelopathy]], spinal cord compression (sometimes referred to colloquially among horse owners as "[[cervical arthritis]]" due to the arthritis that accumulates in facets). Within the horse community, any neurological problem that causes limb [[proprioception]] issues or decreased performance in the horse that is suspected to be rooted in the neck is considered a type of wobbler disease. Most forms of wobbler disease have a root cause in cervical vertebral myelopathy (CVM), which causes inflammation and arthritis in the joint and is painful to affected horses. At this time it is believed to possibly be a [[congenital]] condition. Mounting evidence is growing that points to CVM and other cervical and vertebral disorders (like Kissing Spine) as hereditary and found in populations of specific families.<ref>[http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ceh/local_resources/pdfs/pubs-HR29-2-bkm-sec.pdf UC Davis Center for Equine Health] {{dead link|date=January 2023}}</ref>

Other forms, such as cervical arthritis and equine wobbles anemia, are concentrated in certain breeds and demonstrate possible hereditary factors. Horses with wobbler disease often exhibit [[ataxia]] (implying dysfunction of parts of the nervous system), show weakness in the hindquarters, or may knuckle over in their [[fetlock]]s, particularly in the rear. They also may show overall stiffness especially in the neck and back and may not move fluidly. A common ataxic symptom is the horse will list to one side behind. They also may demonstrate uneven strides with one leg intermittently shorter in step. Horses with wobbler disease or cervical anomalies can demonstrate difficult to diagnose lamenesses that come and go, and often are not resolved by veterinary blocks to the limbs. With advanced stages of the disease, affected horses are prone to falling due to extreme listing behind and often demonstrate difficulty getting up from lying down, or reluctance to lie down at all. While some cases are successfully treated with nutritional and medical management, surgery is also used. One method is the use of [[titanium]] baskets, placed to fuse the vertebrae, thereby preventing compression of the spinal cord. Some horses are able to return to work, with a few able to reach competitive levels. No complete cure for the condition is known. Famous horses known to have completed basket surgery include [[Seattle Slew]]. Seattle Slew underwent two basket surgeries and has sired multiple offspring that have cervical arthritis. He is one of many Thoroughbred stallions to have undergone basket surgery and still be used for stud.

Because wobbler disease is the best known of the neurological conditions that affect horses, other, unrelated conditions, such as [[kissing spine]], [[equine protozoal myeloencephalitis]] and [[cerebellar abiotrophy]], are sometimes misdiagnosed as wobbler disease, though the causes and symptoms differ.

===Clinical Presentation===
Including the symptoms listed above, clinical presentations of "wobblers" can also include neck pain and stiffness, difficulty tracking up or gait abnormalities, decreased performance, intermittent or swapping lameness particularly in diagonal pairs, forelimb lameness, abnormal head and neck posture, defensiveness or change in behavior, and abnormal sweat patterns.

===Diagnosis===
Wobbler disease is definitively diagnosed by x-ray, [[nuclear scintigraphy]] or bone scan. X-rays will show channel widening or filling the easiest and are often most cost-effective to horse owners. X-rays will also show any structural anomaly, arthritis, facet remodeling, or bone spurs present. Preliminary diagnosis can be made by ultrasound but x-rays are needed to measure the true depth of facet involvement. For extent of damage to associated structures, veterinarians may opt to have the horse undergo a bone scan or nuclear scintigraphy.
