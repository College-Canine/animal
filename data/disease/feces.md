'''Feces''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|or]] '''faeces'''; {{singular}}: '''faex''') are the solid or semi-solid remains of food that was not digested in the [[small intestine]], and has been broken down by bacteria in the [[large intestine]].<ref name=tortora1>{{cite book |last1=Tortora |first1=Gerard J. |last2=Anagnostakos |first2=Nicholas P. |title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofanat05tort |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofanat05tort/page/624 624] |edition=Fifth |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-06-350729-6}}</ref><ref name=ciba>{{cite book |last1=Diem |first1=K. |last2=Lentner |first2=C. |chapter=Faeces |title=in: Scientific Tables |edition=Seventh |location=Basle, Switzerland |publisher=CIBA-GEIGY Ltd. |date=1970 |pages=657–660}}</ref> Feces contain a relatively small amount of [[metabolic waste]] products such as bacterially altered [[bilirubin]], and dead epithelial cells from the lining of the gut.<ref name=tortora1 />

Feces are discharged through the [[anus]] or [[cloaca]] during [[defecation]].

Feces can be used as [[fertilizer]] or [[soil conditioner]] in agriculture. They can also be burned as [[dry animal dung fuel|fuel]] or dried and used for [[wattle and daub|construction]]. Some [[medicinal]] uses have been found. In the case of [[human feces]], fecal transplants or [[fecal bacteriotherapy]] are in use. [[Urine]] and feces together are called [[excretion|excreta]].

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Hydrogen-sulfide-3D-vdW.png|right|thumb|100px|The [[molecule]] [[hydrogen sulfide]] contributes to the smell of feces.]]The distinctive [[odor]] of feces is due to [[skatole]], and [[thiol]]s ([[sulfur]]-containing compounds), as well as amines and carboxylic acids. Skatole is produced from [[tryptophan]] via indoleacetic acid. [[Decarboxylation]] gives skatole.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=T. R. |last2=Price |first2=N. P. |last3=Drake |first3=H.

===Physiology===
{{Main|Defecation}}
Feces are discharged through the [[anus]] or [[cloaca]] during [[defecation]]. This process requires pressures that may reach {{convert|100|mmHg|inHg}} (13.3 kPa) in humans and {{convert|450|mmHg|inHg}} (60 kPa) in penguins.<ref name="LangleyCheraskin1958">{{cite book |last1=Langley |first1=Leroy Lester |last2=Cheraskin |first2=Emmanuel |title=The Physiology of Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPFGAAAAYAAJ |year=1958 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |access-date=3 December 2019 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801131456/https://books.google.com/books?id=aPFGAAAAYAAJ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Meyer-RochowGal2003">{{cite journal |last1=Meyer-Rochow |first1=Victor Benno |last2=Gal |first2=Jozsef |title=Pressures produced when penguins pooh?calculations on avian defaecation |journal=Polar Biology |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=56–58 |issn=0722-4060 |doi=10.1007/s00300-003-0563-3 |bibcode=2003PoBio..27...56M |s2cid=43386022}}</ref> The forces required to expel the feces are generated through muscular contractions and a build-up of gases inside the gut, prompting the sphincter to relieve the pressure and release the feces.<ref name="Meyer-RochowGal2003" />

==Ecology==
After an animal has digested eaten material, the remains of that material are discharged from its body as waste. Although it is lower in energy than the food from which it is derived, feces may retain a large amount of energy, often 50% of that of the original food.<ref name="CummingsCampbell2008">{{cite book |last1=Cummings |first1=Benjamin |last2=Campbell |first2=Neil A. |title=Biology, 8th Edition, Campbell & Reece, 2008: Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nZlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA890 |edition=8th |year=2008 |publisher=Pearson |page=890 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This means that of all food eaten, a significant amount of energy remains for the decomposers of ecosystems.

Many organisms feed on feces, from bacteria to fungi to insects such as [[dung beetle]]s, who can [[sensory system|sense]] odors from long distances.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1179-146 |vauthors=Heinrich B, Bartholomew GA |title=The ecology of the African dung beetle |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=241 |issue=5 |pages=146–56 |year=1979 |bibcode=1979SciAm.241e.146H}}</ref> Some may specialize in feces, while others may eat other foods. Feces serve not only as a basic food, but also as a supplement to the usual diet of some animals. This process is known as [[coprophagia]], and occurs in various animal species such as young elephants eating the feces of their mothers to gain essential [[gut flora]], or by other animals such as dogs, rabbits, and monkeys.

Feces and urine, which reflect [[ultraviolet]] light, are important to raptors such as [[kestrel]]s, who can see the [[near ultraviolet]] and thus find their prey by their [[animal latrine|midden]]s and [[territory (animal)|territorial]] markers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.manhattan.ks.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=6468 |title=Document: Krestel |publisher=City of Manhattan, Kansas |access-date=11 February 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Seed]]s also may be found in feces. Animals who eat [[fruit]] are known as [[frugivore]]s. An advantage for a plant in having fruit is that animals will eat the fruit and unknowingly disperse the seed in doing so. This mode of [[seed dispersal]] is highly successful, as seeds dispersed around the base of a plant are unlikely to succeed and often are subject to heavy [[seed predation|predation]]. Provided the seed can withstand the pathway through the digestive system, it is not only likely to be far away from the parent plant, but is even provided with its own fertilizer.

Organisms that subsist on dead organic matter or ''[[detritus]]'' are known as [[detritivore]]s, and play an important role in ecosystems by recycling organic matter back into a simpler form that plants and other [[autotroph]]s may absorb once again. This cycling of matter is known as the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. To maintain nutrients in soil it is therefore important that feces returns to the area from which they came, which is not always the case in human society where food may be transported from rural areas to urban populations and then feces disposed of into a river or sea.

==Human feces==
{{main|Human feces}}

Depending on the individual and the circumstances, human beings may defecate several times a day, every day, or once every two or three days. Extensive hardening of the feces that interrupts this routine for several days or more is called [[constipation]].

The appearance of human fecal matter varies according to diet and health.<ref name="Stromberg2015">{{Cite web |title=Everybody poops. But here are 9 surprising facts about feces you may not know. |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |work=Vox |date=22 January 2015 |access-date=3 December 2019 |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871579/poop-feces |archive-date=17 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117130338/https://www.vox.com/2015/1/22/7871579/poop-feces |url-status=live}}</ref> Normally it is semisolid, with a [[mucus]] coating. A combination of [[bile]] and [[bilirubin]], which comes from dead [[red blood cells]], gives feces the typical brown color.<ref name=tortora1 /><ref name=ciba />

After the [[meconium]], the first stool expelled, a newborn's feces contains only [[bile]], which gives it a yellow-green color. [[Breast feeding]] babies expel soft, pale yellowish, and not quite malodorous matter; but once the baby begins to eat, and the body starts expelling bilirubin from dead red blood cells, its matter acquires the familiar brown color.<ref name=ciba />

At different times in their life, human beings will expel feces of different colors and textures. A stool that passes rapidly through the intestines will look greenish; lack of bilirubin will make the stool look like clay.

=== Coprolites and paleofeces ===

A [[coprolite]] is [[fossilized]] feces and is classified as a [[trace fossil]]. In [[paleontology]] they give evidence about the diet of an animal. They were first described by [[William Buckland]] in 1829. Prior to this, they were known as "fossil [[conifer cone#Pinaceae cones|fir cone]]s" and "[[bezoar]] stones". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/coprolite |title=Definition of coprolite &#124; Dictionary.com |website=dictionary.com |access-date=16 March 2021 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109120934/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/coprolite |url-status=live}}</ref> Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to more than 60 centimetres.

[[Palaeofeces]] are ancient [[human feces|feces]], often found as part of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations or surveys. Intact paleofeces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions. These are studied to determine the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[health]] of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. Feces may contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about the material. They also may be analyzed chemically for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using [[lipid]] analysis and ancient [[DNA]] analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Poinar |first1=Hendrik N. |display-authors=etal |date=10 April 2001 |title=A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=98 |issue=8 |pages=4317–4322 |doi=10.1073/pnas.061014798 |pmc=31832 |pmid=11296282 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98.4317P |doi-access=free}}</ref>
  
The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. Generally, this material is the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is so direct an indicator.<ref name="Feder2008">{{cite book |last=Feder |first=Kenneth L. |title=Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEFsPwAACAAJ |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533117-2 |access-date=3 December 2019 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801124206/https://books.google.com/books?id=XEFsPwAACAAJ |url-status=live}}</ref>

A process that preserves feces in a way that they may be analyzed later is the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stokstad |first=Erik |date=28 July 2000 |title=Divining Diet and Disease From DNA |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5479 |pages=530–531 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.530 |pmid=10939960 |s2cid=83373644}}</ref>

== Terminology ==
[[File:Cyclosia papilionaris by Kadavoor.JPG|thumb|''[[Cyclosia papilionaris]]'' consuming bird droppings]]

''Feces'' is the scientific terminology, while the term ''stool'' is also commonly used in medical contexts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stool |title=stool |via=The Free Dictionary |access-date=18 April 2017 |archive-date=11 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311062946/http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stool |url-status=live}}</ref> Outside of scientific contexts, these terms are less common, with the most common layman's term being ''poop'' or ''poo''. The term ''[[shit]]'' is also in common use, although it is widely considered vulgar or offensive. There are many other terms, see below.

=== Etymology ===
The word ''faeces'' is the plural of the [[Latin]] word ''[[:wikt:faex|faex]]'' meaning "dregs". In most English-language [[usage]], there is no singular form, making the word a [[plurale tantum]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3400 |title=Feces definition – Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=19 March 2012 |access-date=11 November 2013 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111175053/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3400 |url-status=live}}</ref> out of various major dictionaries, only one enters [[English plurals#Plural in form but singular in construction|variation from plural agreement]].<ref name="AHD">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=. |access-date=17 March 2015 |archive-date=25 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104737/https://ahdictionary.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Further|Shit}}
"Feces" is used more in biology and medicine than in other fields (reflecting [[science]]'s tradition of classical Latin and [[Neo-Latin]])
*In hunting and tracking, terms such as ''dung'', ''scat'', ''spoor'', and ''droppings'' normally are used to refer to non-human animal feces
*In husbandry and farming, ''[[manure]]'' is common.
*''Stool'' is a common term in reference to [[human feces]]. For example, in [[medicine]], to diagnose the presence or absence of a medical condition, a [[stool sample]] sometimes is requested for testing purposes.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steven Dowshen, MD |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/medical/test_bac_culture.html |title=Stool Test: Bacteria Culture |publisher=Kidshealth |date=September 2011 |access-date=11 February 2012 |archive-date=19 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219213101/http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/medical/test_bac_culture.html |url-status=live}}</ref>
*The term ''bowel movement(s)'' (with each movement a defecation event) is also common in [[health care]].

There are many synonyms in informal [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] for feces, just like there are for [[urine]]. Many are [[euphemism|euphem]]istic, [[colloquialism|colloquial]], or both; some are [[profanity|profane]] (such as ''[[shit]]''), whereas most belong chiefly to [[baby talk|child-directed speech]] (such as ''poo'' or the [[palindromic|palindromic word]] ''poop''<!-- That is enough examples; this list is not meant to be exhaustive -->) or to [[off-color humor|crude humor]] (such as ''crap'', ''dump'', ''load'' and ''turd''.<!-- That is enough examples; this list is not meant to be exhaustive -->).
