'''''Staphylococcus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-positive]] [[bacteria]] in the family [[Staphylococcaceae]] from the order [[Bacillales]]. Under the [[microscope]], they appear spherical ([[cocci]]), and form in [[grape]]-like clusters. ''Staphylococcus'' species are [[facultative anaerobic organism]]s (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically).

The name was coined in 1880 by Scottish surgeon and bacteriologist [[Alexander Ogston]] (1844–1929), following the pattern established five years earlier with the naming of ''[[Streptococcus]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/staphylococcus|title=staphylococcus {{!}} Origin and meaning of staphylococcus by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> It combines the prefix "staphylo-" (from {{lang-grc|σταφυλή|staphylē|bunch of grapes}}<ref>{{LSJ|σταφυλή|stafulh/|longref}}</ref>), and suffixed by the {{Lang-la-x-new|coccus||spherical bacterium}} (from {{Lang-grc|κόκκος|kókkos|grain, seed, berry|link=no}}<ref>{{LSJ|κόκκος|ko)kkos|shortref}}</ref>).

Staphylococcus was one of the leading infections in hospitals and many strains of this bacterium have become [[antibiotic resistant]]. Despite strong attempts to get rid of them, staph bacteria stay present in hospitals, where they can infect people who are most at risk of infection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/staph-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20356221|title=Staph infections|website=mayoclinic.org|access-date=2022-11-27}}</ref>

A twelfth group – that of ''S. caseolyticus'' – has now been removed to a new genus, ''[[Macrococcus]]'', the species of which are currently the closest known relatives of ''Staphylococcus''.<ref name="Kloos1998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kloos WE, Ballard DN, George CG, Webster JA, Hubner RJ, Ludwig W, Schleifer KH, Fiedler F, Schubert K | title = Delimiting the genus ''Staphylococcus'' through description of ''Macrococcus caseolyticus'' gen. nov., comb. nov. and ''Macrococcus equipercicus'' sp. nov., and ''Macrococcus bovicus'' sp. no. and Macrococcus carouselicus sp. nov | journal = International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 859–77 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9734040 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-48-3-859 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Two species were described in 2015 – ''[[Staphylococcus argenteus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus schweitzeri]]'' – both of which were previously considered variants of ''S. aureus''.<ref name=Tong2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong SY, Schaumburg F, Ellington MJ, Corander J, Pichon B, Leendertz F, Bentley SD, Parkhill J, Holt DC, Peters G, Giffard PM | title = Novel staphylococcal species that form part of a Staphylococcus aureus-related complex: the non-pigmented ''Staphylococcus argenteus'' sp. nov. and the non-human primate-associated ''Staphylococcus schweitzeri'' sp. nov | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 65 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 15–22 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25269845 | pmc = 4298100 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.062752-0 }}</ref>

A new coagulase negative species – ''[[Staphylococcus edaphicus]]'' – has been isolated from [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantůček R, Sedláček I, Indráková A, Vrbovská V, Mašlaňová I, Kovařovic V, Švec P, Králová S, Krištofová L, Kekláková J, Petráš P, Doškař J | title = mecCgene and genomic islands with suspected role in adaptation to extreme environment | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = e01746–17 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29079617 | pmc = 5752872 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01746-17 }}</ref>  This species is probably a member of the ''S. saprophyticus'' group.

===Groups===
Based on an analysis of orthologous gene content three groups (A, B and C) have been proposed.<ref name=Coates-Brown2018>Coates-Brown R, Moran JC, Pongchaikul P, Darby AC and MJ Horsburgh MJ (2018) "Comparative genomics of ''Staphylococcus'' reveals determinants of speciation and diversification of antimicrobial defense". ''Front Microbiol''</ref>

Group A includes ''S. aureus'', ''S. borealis'', ''S. capitis'', ''S. epidermidis'', ''S. haemolyticus'', ''S. hominis'', ''S. lugdunensis'', ''S. pettenkoferi'', ''S. simiae'' and  ''S. warneri''.

Group B includes ''S. arlettae'', ''S. cohnii'', ''S. equorum'', ''S. saprophyticus'' and ''S. xylosus''.

Group C includes ''S. delphini'', ''S. intermedius'' and ''S. pseudintermedius''.

===Notes===
The ''S. saprophyticus'' and ''S. sciuri'' groups are generally [[novobiocin]]-resistant, as is ''S. hominis'' subsp. ''novobiosepticus''.

Members of the ''S. sciuri'' group are [[oxidase]]-positive due to their possession of the enzyme [[cytochrome c oxidase]]. This group is the only clade within the staphylococci to possess this gene.

The ''S. sciuri'' group appears to be the closest relations to the genus ''[[Macrococcus]]''.

''S. pulvereri'' has been shown to be a junior synonym of ''S. vitulinus''.<ref name="Svec2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Svec P, Vancanneyt M, Sedlácek I, Engelbeen K, Stetina V, Swings J, Petrás P | title = Reclassification of Staphylococcus pulvereri Zakrzewska-Czerwinska et al. 1995 as a later synonym of ''Staphylococcus vitulinus'' Webster et al. 1994 | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 54 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 2213–5 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15545460 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.63080-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Within these clades, the ''S. haemolyticus'' and ''S. simulans'' groups appear to be related, as do the ''S. aureus'' and ''S. epidermidis'' groups.<ref name="Ghebremedhin2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghebremedhin B, Layer F, König W, König B | title = Genetic classification and distinguishing of ''Staphylococcus'' species based on different partial gap, 16S rRNA, hsp60, rpoB, sodA, and tuf gene sequences | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 1019–25 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18174295 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.02058-07 | pmc = 2268370 }}</ref>

''S. lugdunensis'' appears to be related to the ''S. haemolyticus'' group.

''S. petrasii'' may be related to ''S. haemolyticus'', but this needs to be confirmed.

The taxonomic position of  ''S. lyticans'',''S. petrasii'', and ''S. pseudolugdunensis'' has yet to be clarified. The published descriptions of these species do not appear to have been validly published.

==Biochemical identification==

Assignment of a strain to the genus ''Staphylococcus'' requires it to be a [[Gram-positive]] [[coccus]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=2021-12-15|title=Identification of marine sponge-associated bacteria of the Saint Martin's island of the Bay of Bengal emphasizing on the prevention of motile Aeromonas septicemia in Labeo rohita|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004484862100819X|journal=Aquaculture|language=en|volume=545|pages=737156|doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737156|issn=0044-8486|last1=Paul|first1=Sulav Indra|last2=Rahman|first2=Md.

Tofazzal}}</ref> that forms clusters, has an appropriate [[cell wall]] structure (including [[peptidoglycan]] type and teichoic acid presence) and G + C content of DNA in a range of 30–40&nbsp;mol%.

''Staphylococcus'' species can be differentiated from other aerobic and facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive cocci by several simple tests.<ref name=":0" /> ''Staphylococcus'' species are facultative [[anaerobes]] (capable of growth both aerobically and anaerobically).<ref name=":0" />  All species grow in the presence of [[bile salts]].

All species of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' were once thought to be coagulase-positive, but this has since been disproven.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref><ref>PreTest, Surgery, 12th ed., p. 88</ref><ref name="CNSA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Matthews KR, Roberson J, Gillespie BE, Luther DA, Oliver SP | title = Identification and Differentiation of Coagulase-Negative ''Staphylococcus aureus'' by Polymerase Chain Reaction |journal=Journal of Food Protection |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=686–8 |year=1997 |doi=10.4315/0362-028X-60.6.686 |pmid=31195568|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Growth can also occur in a 6.5% NaCl solution.<ref name=":0" /> On [[Baird-Parker agar|Baird-Parker medium]], ''Staphylococcus'' species grow fermentatively, except for ''S. saprophyticus'', which grows oxidatively. ''Staphylococcus'' species are resistant to [[bacitracin]] (0.04 U disc: resistance = <&nbsp;10&nbsp;mm zone of inhibition) and susceptible to [[furazolidone]] (100&nbsp;μg disc: resistance = <&nbsp;15&nbsp;mm zone of inhibition). Further biochemical testing is needed to identify to the species level.

==Coagulase production==

One of the most important phenotypical features used in the classification of staphylococci is their ability to produce [[coagulase]], an enzyme that causes [[blood clot]] formation.

Seven species are currently recognised as being coagulase-positive: ''S. aureus'', ''S. delphini'', ''S. hyicus'', ''S. intermedius'', ''S. lutrae'', ''S. pseudintermedius'', and ''S. schleiferi'' subsp. ''coagulans''. These species belong to two separate groups – the ''S. aureus'' (''S. aureus'' alone) group and the ''S. hyicus-intermedius'' group (the remaining five).

An eighth species has also been described – ''Staphylococcus leei'' – from patients with [[gastritis]].<ref name="Jin2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin M, Rosario W, Watler E, Calhoun DH | title = Development of a large-scale HPLC-based purification for the urease from ''Staphylococcus leei'' and determination of subunit structure | journal = Protein Expression and Purification | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–7 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14766306 | doi = 10.1016/j.pep.2003.10.012 }}</ref>

''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' is coagulase-positive, meaning it produces coagulase. However, while the majority of ''S. aureus'' strains are coagulase-positive, some may be atypical in that they do not produce coagulase. ''S. aureus'' is [[catalase]]-positive (meaning that it can produce the enzyme catalase) and able to convert [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to water and oxygen, which makes the catalase test useful to distinguish staphylococci from [[Enterococcus|enterococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]].

''[[Staphylococcus pseudintermedius|S. pseudintermedius]]'' inhabits and sometimes infects the skin of domestic dogs and cats. This organism, too, can carry the genetic material that imparts multiple bacterial resistance. It is rarely implicated in infections in humans, as a [[zoonosis]].

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'', a coagulase-negative species, is a [[commensal]] of the skin, but can cause severe infections in [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] patients and those with [[central venous catheters]].
''[[Staphylococcus saprophyticus|S. saprophyticus]]'', another coagulase-negative species that is part of the normal [[vaginal flora]], is predominantly implicated in [[genitourinary tract]] infections in sexually active young women.
In recent years, several other ''Staphylococcus'' species have been implicated in human infections, notably ''[[Staphylococcus lugdunensis|S. lugdunensis]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus schleiferi|S. schleiferi]]'', and ''[[Staphylococcus caprae|S. caprae]]''.

Common abbreviations for coagulase-negative staphylococci are CoNS, CNS, or CNST.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker K, Heilmann C, Peters G | title = Coagulase-negative staphylococci | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 870–926 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25278577 | pmc = 4187637 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00109-13 }}</ref> The [[American Society for Microbiology]] abbreviates coagulase-negative staphylococci as "CoNS".

==Genomics and molecular biology==

The first ''S. aureus'' [[genome]]s to be sequenced were those of N315 and Mu50, in 2001. Many more complete ''S. aureus'' genomes have been submitted to the public databases, making it one of the most extensively sequenced bacteria. The use of genomic data is now widespread and provides a valuable resource for researchers working with ''S. aureus''. Whole genome technologies, such as sequencing projects and [[microarray]]s, have shown an enormous variety of ''S. aureus'' strains. Each contains different combinations of surface proteins and different [[toxin]]s. Relating this information to pathogenic behaviour is one of the major areas of staphylococcal research. The development of molecular typing methods has enabled the tracking of different strains of ''S. aureus''. This may lead to better control of outbreak strains. A greater understanding of how the staphylococci evolve, especially due to the acquisition of mobile genetic elements encoding resistance and virulence genes is helping to identify new outbreak strains and may even prevent their emergence.<ref name=LindsayJ>{{cite book | veditors = Lindsay J | title = ''Staphylococcus'': Molecular Genetics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/staph | isbn = 978-1-904455-29-5 }}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref>

The widespread incidence of [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] across various strains of ''S. aureus'', or across different species of ''Staphylococcus'' has been attributed to [[horizontal gene transfer]] of genes encoding antibiotic/metal resistance and virulence. A recent study demonstrated the extent of horizontal gene transfer among ''Staphylococcus'' to be much greater than previously expected, and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the [[mobile genetic elements]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in ''Staphylococcus'' extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–77 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | pmc = 3147504 }}</ref>

Various strains of ''Staphylococcus'' are available from biological research centres, such as the [[National Collection of Type Cultures]].

==Host range==
[[File:20101017 231210 Staphylococcus.jpg|thumb|Unknown variety of ''Staphylococcus'', [[Gram staining|Gram-stained]] – numbered ticks on the scale are 11&nbsp;[[µm]] apart]]

Members of the genus ''Staphylococcus'' frequently colonize the skin and upper respiratory tracts of mammals and birds and also in [[Sponge|marine sponge]].<ref name=":0" /> Marine sponge associated ''Staphylococcus'' species are highly salt tolerant.<ref name=":0" /> Some species specificity has been observed in host range, such that the ''Staphylococcus'' species observed on some animals appear more rarely on more distantly related host species.<ref name=pmid7002032>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kloos WE | title = Natural populations of the genus ''Staphylococcus'' | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 34 | pages = 559–92 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7002032 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.34.100180.003015 }}</ref>

=== Populations at risk for ''Staphylococcus aureus'' infection ===
It is said that anyone can develop a staph infection, although certain groups of people are at greater risk, including people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, eczema, lung disease, and people who inject drugs. In healthcare facilities, the risk of more serious staph infection is higher because many patients have weakened immune systems or have undergone procedures. In healthcare, the risk of more serious staph infection is higher for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), patients who have undergone certain types of surgeries and patients with medical devices inserted in their bodies.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-12-10 |title=Staphylococcus aureus in Healthcare Settings {{!}} HAI |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/staph.html |access-date=2022-04-23 |website=CDC |language=en-us}}</ref>

''Staphylococcus aureus'' has emerged as a leading agent of [[sepsis]]. It facilitates factors such as tissue adhesion, immune evasion, and host cell injury. In the bloodstream, these factors cause inflammation, impair immune cell function, alter coagulation, and compromise vascular integrity. When left untreated, ''S. aureus'' triggers pathophysiologic disturbances that are further amplified by the host inflammatory response, culminating in the severe clinical manifestations of sepsis and [[septic shock]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Powers |first1=Michael E. |last2=Wardenburg |first2=Juliane Bubeck |title=Igniting the Fire: Staphylococcus aureus Virulence Factors in the Pathogenesis of Sepsis |journal=PLOS Pathogens |date=13 February 2014 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=e1003871 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003871 |pmid=24550724 |language=en |issn=1553-7374|pmc=3923759 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Clinical==

{{Main|Staphylococcal infection}}
''Staphylococcus'' can cause a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals through either toxin production or penetration. Staphylococcal toxins are a common cause of food poisoning, for they can be produced by bacteria growing in improperly stored food items. The most common [[sialadenitis]] is caused by staphylococci, as bacterial infections.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.doctorhoffman.com/wwsialo.htm |title=Sialoadenitis: inflammation of the salivary glands |date=2001-01-04 |publisher=The Medical Consumer's Advocate |access-date=2011-01-04}}</ref> Staphylococci break down [[leucine]] into [[3-Methylbutanoic acid|isovaleric acid]], the main odor of foot odor.<ref>Stevens D, Cornmell R, Taylor D, Grimshaw SG, Riazanskaia S, Arnold DS, Fernstad SJ, Smith AM, Heaney LM, Reynolds JC, Thomas CL, Harker M. Spatial variations in the microbial community structure and diversity of the human foot is associated with the production of odorous volatiles.
