A person who has dilated cardiomyopathy may have an [[cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]], with [[pulmonary edema]] and an elevated [[jugular venous pressure]] and a low [[pulse pressure]]. Signs of [[mitral regurgitation|mitral]] and [[tricuspid regurgitation]] may be present.<ref name=":0" />

==Causes==
Although in many cases no cause is apparent, dilated cardiomyopathy is probably the result of damage to the [[myocardium]] produced by a variety of [[toxic]], [[metabolic]], or infectious agents. In many cases the cause remains unclear. It may be due to fibrous change of the myocardium from a previous [[myocardial infarction]]. Or, it may be the late sequelae of acute viral [[myocarditis]], such as with [[Coxsackie B virus]] and other [[enterovirus]]es<ref name=Robbins8th>{{cite book | vauthors = Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |edition=8th|year=2007 }}</ref> possibly mediated through an immunologic mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martino TA, Liu P, Sole MJ | title = Viral infection and the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 182–8 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8293557 | doi = 10.1161/01.res.74.2.182 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Specific [[autoantibodies]] are detectable in some cases.<ref>Yoshikawa T, Baba A, Nagatomo Y.

Recent studies have shown that those subjects with an extremely high occurrence (several thousands a day) of [[premature ventricular contractions]] (extrasystole) can develop dilated cardiomyopathy.

About 25–35% of affected individuals have familial forms of the disease,<ref name=Robbins8th/> with most [[mutation]]s affecting genes encoding [[Cytoskeleton|cytoskeletal]] proteins,<ref name=Robbins8th/> while some affect other proteins involved in contraction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross J | title = Dilated cardiomyopathy: concepts derived from gene deficient and transgenic animal models | journal = Circulation Journal | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–24 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11922267 | doi = 10.1253/circj.66.219 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The disease is genetically heterogeneous, but the most common form of its transmission is an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.<ref name=Robbins8th/>

Kayvanpour et al. performed 2016 a meta-analysis with the largest dataset available on genotype-phenotype associations in DCM and mutations in lamin (LMNA), phospholamban (PLN), RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20), Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3), Myosin Heavy Chain 7 (MYH7), Cardiac Troponin T 2 (TNNT2), and Cardiac Troponin I (TNNI3). They also reviewed recent studies investigating genotype-phenotype associations in DCM patients with titin (TTN) mutations. LMNA and PLN mutation carriers showed a high prevalence of cardiac transplantation and ventricular arrhythmia. Dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was shown to occur even before the manifestation of DCM and heart failure symptoms in LMNA mutation carriers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kayvanpour E, Sedaghat-Hamedani F, Amr A, Lai A, Haas J, Holzer DB, Frese KS, Keller A, Jensen K, Katus HA, Meder B | display-authors = 6 | title = Genotype-phenotype associations in dilated cardiomyopathy: meta-analysis on more than 8000 individuals | journal = Clinical Research in Cardiology | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–139 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27576561 | doi = 10.1007/s00392-016-1033-6 | s2cid = 27511518 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Blausen 0165 Cardiomyopathy Dilated.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of a Normal Heart vs. Heart with Dilated Cardiomyopathy]]
The progression of heart failure is associated with left ventricular remodeling, which manifests as gradual increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall thinning, and a change in chamber geometry to a more spherical, less elongated shape. This process is usually associated with a continuous decline in [[ejection fraction]]. The concept of cardiac remodeling was initially developed to describe changes that occur in the days and months following myocardial infarction.<ref name=PIESKE2004>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieske B |title=Reverse remodeling in heart failure – fact or fiction? |journal=Eur Heart J Suppl |volume=6 |pages=D66–78 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.ehjsup.2004.05.019|doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Compensation effects ===
As DCM progresses, two compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to impaired myocyte contractility and reduced stroke volume:<ref name=":0" />
* [[Frank–Starling law|Frank-Starling law]]
* Neurohormonal feedback, via activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin]] system.
These responses initially compensate for decreased cardiac output and maintain those with DCM as asymptomatic. Eventually, however, these mechanisms become detrimental, intravascular volume becomes too great, and progressive dilatation leads to heart failure symptoms.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Computational models===
Cardiac dilatation is a transversely [[isotropic]], irreversible process resulting from excess strains on the [[myocardium]].<ref name = "Goektepe_2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2010.07.003 |title=Generic approach towards finite growth with examples of athlete's heart, cardiac dilation, and cardiac wall thickening |year=2010 | vauthors = Goektepe S, Abilez OJ, Kuhl E |journal=Mechanics and Physics of Solids |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=1661–1680|bibcode=2010JMPSo..58.1661G }}</ref> A computation model of volumetric, isotropic, and cardiac wall growth predicts the relationship between cardiac strains (e.g. volume overload after myocardial infarction) and dilation using the following governing equations:{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

<math>F = F^e \cdot F^g\,</math>

where <math>F^e</math> is elastic volume stretch that is reversible and <math>F^g</math> is irreversible, isotropic volume growth described by:{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

<math>F^g = \mathbb{I}+[\lambda^{g}-1]f_{0}\otimes f_{0} \,</math>

where <math>f_{0}</math> is a vector, which points along a [[cardiomyocyte]]'s long axis and <math> \lambda^g </math> is the cardiomyocyte stretch due to growth. The total cardiomyocyte growth is given by:

<math>\lambda = \lambda^e \cdot F\lambda^g\,</math>

The above model reveals a gradual dilation of the [[myocardium]], especially the ventricular myocardium, to support the blood [[volume overload]] in the chambers. Dilation manifests itself in an increase in total cardiac mass and cardiac diameter. Cardiomyocytes reach their maximum length of 150 <math>\mu</math>m in the endocardium and 130 <math>\mu</math>m in the epicardium by the addition of [[Sarcomere|sarcomeres]].<ref name = "Goektepe_2010" />  Due to the increase in diameter, the dilated heart appears spherical in shape, as opposed the elliptical shape of a healthy human heart. In addition, the ventricular walls maintain the same thickness, characteristic of pathophysiological cardiac dilation.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Valvular effects ===
As the ventricles enlarge, both the mitral and tricuspid valves may lose their ability to come together properly. This loss of coaptation may lead to [[Mitral insufficiency|mitral]] and [[Tricuspid insufficiency|tricuspid regurgitation]]. As a result, those with DCM are at increased risk of [[atrial fibrillation]]. Furthermore, stroke volume is decreased and a greater volume load is placed on the ventricle, thus increasing heart failure symptoms.<ref name=":0" />

When [[left bundle-branch block]] (LBBB) is accompanied by [[right axis deviation]] (RAD), the rare combination is considered to be highly suggestive of dilated or congestive cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikolic G, Marriott HJ | title = Left bundle branch block with right axis deviation: a marker of congestive cardiomyopathy | journal = Journal of Electrocardiology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–404 | date = October 1985 | pmid = 3906012 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-0736(85)80022-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Childers R, Lupovich S, Sochanski M, Konarzewska H | title = Left bundle branch block and right axis deviation: a report of 36 cases | journal = Journal of Electrocardiology | volume = 33 Suppl | issue = Suppl | pages = 93–102 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11265743 | doi = 10.1054/jclc.2000.20326 }}</ref> [[Echocardiogram]] shows left ventricular dilatation with normal or thinned walls and reduced [[ejection fraction]]. Cardiac [[catheterization]] and [[coronary angiography]] are often performed to exclude ischemic heart disease.<ref name="Dilated Cardiomyopathy"/>

[[Genetic testing]] can be important, since one study has shown that gene mutations in the TTN gene (which codes for a protein called [[titin]]) are responsible for "approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 18% of sporadic cases."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman DS, Lam L, Taylor MR, Wang L, Teekakirikul P, Christodoulou D, Conner L, DePalma SR, McDonough B, Sparks E, Teodorescu DL, Cirino AL, Banner NR, Pennell DJ, Graw S, Merlo M, Di Lenarda A, Sinagra G, Bos JM, Ackerman MJ, Mitchell RN, Murry CE, Lakdawala NK, Ho CY, Barton PJ, Cook SA, Mestroni L, Seidman JG, Seidman CE | display-authors = 6 | title = Truncations of titin causing dilated cardiomyopathy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 7 | pages = 619–28 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22335739 | pmc = 3660031 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110186 }}</ref> The results of the genetic testing can help the doctors and patients understand the underlying cause of the dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic test results can also help guide decisions on whether a patient's relatives should undergo genetic testing (to see if they have the same genetic mutation) and cardiac testing to screen for early findings of dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref name="Dilated Cardiomyopathy"/>

[[Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging]] (cardiac MRI) may also provide helpful diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennell DJ, Sechtem UP, Higgins CB, Manning WJ, Pohost GM, Rademakers FE, van Rossum AC, Shaw LJ, Yucel EK | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical indications for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR): Consensus Panel report | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 25 | issue = 21 | pages = 1940–65 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15522474 | doi = 10.1016/j.ehj.2004.06.040 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Treatment==

=== Medical therapy ===
Drug therapy can slow down progression and in some cases even improve the heart condition. Standard therapy may include salt restriction, [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[diuretic]]s, and [[beta blocker]]s.<ref name=":0" /> [[Anticoagulation|Anticoagulants]] may also be used for antithrombotic therapy. There is some evidence for the benefits of [[coenzyme Q10]] in treating heart failure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langsjoen PH, Langsjoen PH, Folkers K | title = A six-year clinical study of therapy of cardiomyopathy with coenzyme Q10 | journal = International Journal of Tissue Reactions | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–71 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2276895 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Folkers K, Langsjoen P, Langsjoen PH | title = Therapy with coenzyme Q10 of patients in heart failure who are eligible or ineligible for a transplant | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 182 | issue = 1 | pages = 247–53 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731784 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-291X(05)80137-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggio E, Gandini R, Plancher AC, Passeri M, Carmosino G | title = Italian multicenter study on the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 as adjunctive therapy in heart failure.

=== Electrical treatment ===
[[Artificial pacemaker]]s may be used in patients with intraventricular conduction delay, and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s in those at risk of arrhythmia. These forms of treatment have been shown to prevent sudden cardiac death, improve symptoms, and reduce hospitalization in patients with systolic heart failure.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=Current medical diagnosis & treatment 2017| vauthors = Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ, Rabow MW |isbn=978-1-259-58511-1|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|edition=56|location=New York|oclc=957316517 |date = 2016-09-01}}</ref> In addition, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be considered as a therapeutic option for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with a confirmed LMNA mutation responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy disease phenotype and clinical risk factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Priori|first1=Silvia G.|last2=Blomström-Lundqvist|first2=Carina|last3=Mazzanti|first3=Andrea|last4=Blom|first4=Nico|last5=Borggrefe|first5=Martin|last6=Camm|first6=John|last7=Elliott|first7=Perry Mark|last8=Fitzsimons|first8=Donna|last9=Hatala|first9=Robert|last10=Hindricks|first10=Gerhard|last11=Kirchhof|first11=Paulus|date=November 2015|title=2015 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: The Task Force for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)Endorsed by: Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC)|journal=Europace|volume=17|issue=11|pages=1601–1687|doi=10.1093/europace/euv319|issn=1532-2092|pmid=26318695|doi-access=free}}</ref> A novel risk score calculator has been developed that allows calculation of risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the next 5 years in patients with DCM.<ref>Kayvanpour E, Sammani A, Sedaghat-Hamedani F, Lehmann DH, Broezel A, Koelemenoglu J, Chmielewski P, Curjol A, Socie P, Miersch T, Haas J, Gi WT, Richard P, Płoski R, Truszkowska G, Baas AF, Foss-Nieradko B, Michalak E, Stępień-Wojno M, Zakrzewska-Koperska J, Śpiewak M, Zieliński T, Villard E, TeRiele ASJM, Katus HA, Frey N, Bilińska ZT, Charron P, Asselbergs FW, Meder B.

=== Surgical treatment ===
In patients with advanced disease who are refractory to medical therapy, [[heart transplantation]] may be considered. For these people, 1-year survival approaches 90% and over 50% survive greater than 20 years.<ref name=":1" />

== Epidemiology ==
Although the disease is more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coughlin SS, Labenberg JR, Tefft MC | title = Black-white differences in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: the Washington DC dilated Cardiomyopathy Study | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–72 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8452906 | doi = 10.1097/00001648-199303000-00013 | s2cid = 10961862 | doi-access = free }}</ref> it may occur in any patient population.

== Research directions ==
Therapies that support reverse remodeling have been investigated, and this may suggests a new approach to the prognosis of cardiomyopathies (see [[ventricular remodeling]]).<ref name="PIESKE2004" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reis Filho JR, Cardoso JN, Cardoso CM, Pereira-Barretto AC | title = Reverse Cardiac Remodeling: A Marker of Better Prognosis in Heart Failure | journal = Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 502–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26131706 | pmc = 4484683 | doi = 10.5935/abc.20150025 }}</ref>

==Animals==<!-- This section is linked from [[Irish Wolfhound]] -->
In some types of animals, both a hereditary and acquired version of dilated cardiomyopathy has been documented.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Dogs ===
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heritable disease in some dog breeds, including the [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Dobermann]], [[Great Dane]], [[Irish Wolfhound]], and [[St. Bernard (dog)|St Bernard]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oyama MA, Chittur S | title = Genomic expression patterns of cardiac tissues from dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 1140–55 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16111151 | doi = 10.2460/ajvr.2005.66.1140 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Treatment is based on medication, including ACE inhibitors, [[loop diuretic]]s, and [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

An acquired variation of dilated cardiomyopathy describing a link between certain diets was discovered in 2019 by researchers at [[UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine|University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine]] who published a report on the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in dog breeds lacking the genetic predisposition, particularly in [[Golden Retriever]]s.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Quinton A | date= 28 January 2019 |title=Dogs Fed Some Popular Diets Could Be at Risk of Heart Disease|url=https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/dogs-fed-some-popular-diets-could-be-risk-heart-disease|access-date=2021-02-10|website=UC Davis|language=EN}}</ref> The diets associated with DCM were described as "BEG" (boutique, exotic-ingredient, and/or grain-free) dog foods,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freeman LM, Stern JA, Fries R, Adin DB, Rush JE | title = Diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs: what do we know? | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 253 | issue = 11 | pages = 1390–1394 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30451613 | doi = 10.2460/javma.253.11.1390 | doi-access = free }}</ref> as well as legume-rich diets.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaplan JL, Stern JA, Fascetti AJ, Larsen JA, Skolnik H, Peddle GD, Kienle RD, Waxman A, Cocchiaro M, Gunther-Harrington CT, Klose T, LaFauci K, Lefbom B, Machen Lamy M, Malakoff R, Nishimura S, Oldach M, Rosenthal S, Stauthammer C, O'Sullivan L, Visser LC, Williams R, Ontiveros E | display-authors = 6 | title = Taurine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy in golden retrievers fed commercial diets | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = e0209112 | date = 2018-12-13 | pmid = 30543707 | pmc = 6292607 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0209112 | bibcode = 2018PLoSO..1309112K | doi-access = free }}</ref> For treating diet-related DCM, food changes,  taurine and carnitine supplementation may be indicated even if the dog does not have a documented taurine or carnitine deficiency although the cost of carnitine supplementation may be viewed as prohibitive by some<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanderson SL | title = Taurine and carnitine in canine cardiomyopathy | journal = The Veterinary Clinics of North America.

=== Cats ===
Dilated cardiomyopathy is also a disease affecting some cat breeds, including the [[Oriental Shorthair]], [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]], [[Persian (cat)|Persian]], and [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian]].  In cats, taurine deficiency is the most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pion PD, Kittleson MD, Thomas WP, Skiles ML, Rogers QR | title = Clinical findings in cats with dilated cardiomyopathy and relationship of findings to taurine deficiency | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 201 | issue = 2 | pages = 267–74 | date = July 1992 | doi = 10.2460/javma.1992.201.02.267 | pmid = 1500323 }}</ref> As opposed to these hereditary forms, non-hereditary DCM used to be common in the overall cat population before the addition of taurine to commercial cat food.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Other animals ===
There is also a high incidence of heritable dilated cardiomyopathy in captive [[golden hamster]]s (''Mesocricetus auratus''), due in no small part to their being highly [[Inbreeding|inbred]]. The incidence is high enough that several strains of Golden Hamster have been developed to serve as animal models in clinical testing for human forms of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nigro V, Okazaki Y, Belsito A, Piluso G, Matsuda Y, Politano L, Nigro G, Ventura C, Abbondanza C, Molinari AM, Acampora D, Nishimura M, Hayashizaki Y, Puca GA | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of the Syrian hamster cardiomyopathy gene | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 601–7 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9097966 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/6.4.601 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
