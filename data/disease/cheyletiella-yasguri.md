'''''Cheyletiella yasguri''''' is a species of mites from the genus ''[[Cheyletiella]]'' popularly known as '''"walking dandruff"''' and one of the many ectoparasites that targets domestic dogs.

Characterized as the '''“bite and run”''' parasite, the first reported case of ''Cheyletiella Yasguri'' was in Italy in the year of 1965.<ref>{{cite news|last=Canestri-Trotti G, Venturoli M.|title=Isolation of Cheyletiella yasguri Smiley, 1965 in a dog in Italy|newspaper=National Center for Biotechnology Information|date=1978}}</ref> It is named after Dr. I. Yasgur.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bakkers | first1 = E. J.

The mite contains two lobes compared to the species C. ''parasitivorax'' which only contains one.<ref name="Powell">{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Ralph F. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Susan M. | last3 = Palmer | first3 = Charles H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Edgar B. | year = 1977 | title = Cheyletiella dermatitis | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 679–682 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1977.tb01882.x| pmid = 72050 | s2cid = 43789069 }}</ref> ''Cheyletiella Yasguri'' causes irritation and inflammation of the skin (Dermatitis) usually as a result of allergic reaction.

== Diagnosis ==

In order to diagnose the condition, samples of the skin or fur must be further examined under a microscope. Other techniques used to diagnose the condition include deep scraping of the skin and removal of samples with the use of tape.<ref name="Mueller">{{cite news|last=Mueller|first=Ralf S. |title=Small Animal Dermatology|newspaper=Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Germany}}</ref> Because symptoms are often similar those of Scabies, an accurate diagnosis would be under a microscope.

== Transmission ==
 
It is highly transmittable especially through physical contact. Humans are also prone to becoming infested with mites. If contact with pet is cut off completely symptoms will disappear after a short amount of time because the parasites do not replicate on humans. Common infested areas in humans vary from the chest, abdomen, arms, and buttocks. Common infestation areas in dogs include the neck, back, and tail. Results can be anything from lesions of the skin, severe itching, and sometimes the condition will go unnoticed in dogs.<ref name="Powell"/>

== Treatments ==

In animals treatments range a wide variety of antibiotic therapy, antiparasitic therapy, topical steroids, Gamma benzene hexachloride, and insecticides. Less than one percent Gamma benzene hexachloride has proven to be very effective if used as prescribed by a veterinarian.<ref name="Mueller"/>
