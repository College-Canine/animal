<!-- Regulation -->
[[Beta cell]]s are sensitive to [[blood sugar level]]s so that they secrete insulin into the blood in response to high level of glucose, and inhibit secretion of insulin when glucose levels are low.<ref name=koeslag>{{cite journal |vauthors = Koeslag JH, Saunders PT, Terblanche E |title = A reappraisal of the blood glucose homeostat which comprehensively explains the type 2 diabetes mellitus-syndrome X complex |journal = The Journal of Physiology |volume = 549 |issue = Pt 2 |pages = 333–46 |date = June 2003 | pmid = 12717005 |pmc = 2342944 |doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2002.037895 |publication-date = 2003 }}</ref> Insulin production is also regulated by glucose: high glucose promotes insulin production while low glucose levels lead to lower production.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Andrali |first1=Sreenath S. |last2=Sampley |first2=Megan L. |last3=Vanderford |first3=Nathan L. |last4=Ozcan |first4=Sabire |date=1 October 2008 |title=Glucose regulation of insulin gene expression in pancreatic beta-cells |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18778246 |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=415 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1042/BJ20081029 |issn=1470-8728 |pmid=18778246}}</ref> Insulin enhances glucose uptake and metabolism in the cells, thereby reducing blood sugar.

<!-- Clinical significance -->
Decreased or absent insulin activity results in [[diabetes]], a condition of high blood sugar level ([[hyperglycaemia]]). There are two types of the disease. In [[type 1 diabetes]], the beta cells are destroyed by an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]] so that insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood.<ref name="urlInsulin Injection - PubMed Health">{{cite web |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000729 |title = Insulin Injection [|author = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |date = 1 February 2009 |work = PubMed Health |publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |access-date = 12 October 2012 }}</ref> In [[type 2 diabetes]], the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead, there is an accumulation of [[amyloid]] in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology.<ref name=koeslag /> The [[pathogenesis]] of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive, and peripheral tissue insulin resistance are known to be involved.<ref name="Biochemistry"/> Type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased glucagon secretion which is unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of blood glucose. But insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose.<ref name=koeslag /> As a result, glucose accumulates in the blood.

<!-- Structure -->
The human insulin protein is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. It is a hetero[[protein dimer|dimer]] of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]s. Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. Insulin from non-human animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in [[carbohydrate metabolism]] effects) from human insulin because of these variations. [[Pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by [[Recombinant DNA#Applications of recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]] technologies.<ref name=recombination>Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN [http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ druginfo.nlm.nih.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221119233123/https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ |date=19 November 2022 }}</ref><ref name="urlGenentech">{{cite web |url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o |title=First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced |date=6 September 1978 |publisher=Genentech |work=News Release |access-date=26 September 2016 |archive-date=27 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927073029/http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin">{{cite web |url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm |title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | vauthors = Tof I |year = 1994 |publisher = Little Tree Publishing |access-date = 3 November 2009 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23222785">{{cite journal |vauthors = Aggarwal SR |title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 |journal = Nature Biotechnology |volume = 30 | issue = 12 |pages = 1191–7 |date = December 2012 |pmid = 23222785 |doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437 |s2cid = 8707897 }}</ref>

In addition, cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone antagonize the actions of insulin during times of stress. Insulin also inhibits fatty acid release by [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] in adipose tissue.<ref name="stryer" />

Contrary to an initial belief that hormones would be generally small chemical molecules, as the first peptide hormone known of its structure, insulin was found to be quite large.<ref name=":0" /> A single protein (monomer) of human insulin is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. The [[molecular formula]] of human insulin is C<sub>257</sub>H<sub>383</sub>N<sub>65</sub>O<sub>77</sub>S<sub>6</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16129672|title=Insulin human|publisher=[[PubChem]]|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref> It is a combination of two peptide chains ([[protein dimer|dimer]]) named an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by two [[disulfide bond]]s. The A-chain is composed of 21 amino acids, while the B-chain consists of 30 residues. The linking (interchain) disulfide bonds are formed at cysteine residues between the positions A7-B7 and A20-B19. There is an additional (intrachain) disulfide bond within the A-chain between cysteine residues at positions A6 and A11. The A-chain exhibits two α-helical regions at A1-A8 and A12-A19 which are antiparallel; while the B chain has a central α -helix (covering residues B9-B19) flanked by the disulfide bond on either sides and two β-sheets (covering B7-B10 and B20-B23).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu Z, Gilbert ER, Liu D | title = Regulation of insulin synthesis and secretion and pancreatic Beta-cell dysfunction in diabetes | journal = Current Diabetes Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–53 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22974359 | pmc = 3934755 | doi = 10.2174/157339913804143225 }}</ref>

The amino acid sequence of insulin is [[conserved sequence|strongly conserved]] and varies only slightly between species. [[Cow|Bovine]] insulin differs from human in only three [[amino acid]] residues, and [[Pig|porcine]] insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of [[proinsulin]], however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.<ref name=":1" />

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is about 36000 Da in size. The six molecules are linked together as three dimeric units to form symmetrical molecule. An important feature is the presence of zinc atoms (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) on the axis of symmetry, which are surrounded by three water molecules and three histidine residues at position B10.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules.<ref name="pmid16158220">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn MF | title = Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer -- a review | journal = Biometals | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–303 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16158220 | doi = 10.1007/s10534-005-3685-y | s2cid = 8857694 }}</ref> Insulin can aggregate and form [[fibrillar]] interdigitated [[beta-sheet]]s.

== Function ==

=== Secretion ===
{{See also|Blood glucose regulation}}

[[Beta Cell|Beta cells]] in the [[islets of Langerhans]] release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. The two phases of the insulin release suggest that insulin granules are present in diverse stated populations or "pools". During the first phase of insulin exocytosis, most of the granules predispose for exocytosis are released after the calcium internalization. This pool is known as Readily Releasable Pool (RRP). The RRP granules represent 0.3-0.7% of the total insulin-containing granule population, and they are found immediately adjacent to the plasma membrane. During the second phase of exocytosis, insulin granules require mobilization of granules to the plasma membrane and a previous preparation to undergo their release.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Omar-Hmeadi M, Idevall-Hagren O |title=Insulin granule biogenesis and exocytosis |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=1957–1970 |date=March 2021 |pmid=33146746 |pmc=7966131 |doi=10.1007/s00018-020-03688-4}}</ref> Thus, the second phase of insulin release is governed by the rate at which granules get ready for release. This pool is known as a Reserve Pool (RP). The RP is released slower than the RRP (RRP: 18 granules/min; RP: 6 granules/min).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bratanova-Tochkova TK, Cheng H, Daniel S, Gunawardana S, Liu YJ, Mulvaney-Musa J, Schermerhorn T, Straub SG, Yajima H, Sharp GW |title=Triggering and augmentation mechanisms, granule pools, and biphasic insulin secretion |journal=Diabetes |volume=51 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S83–S90 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11815463 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.S83 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of [[type 2 diabetes|type&nbsp;2 diabetes]].<ref name="pmid11815469">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerich JE |title=Is reduced first-phase insulin release the earliest detectable abnormality in individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes? |journal=Diabetes |volume=51 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S117–S121 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11815469 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.s117 |doi-access=free}}</ref> First-phase release and [[Insulin resistance|insulin sensitivity]] are independent predictors of diabetes.<ref name="pmid20805282">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lorenzo C, Wagenknecht LE, Rewers MJ, Karter AJ, Bergman RN, Hanley AJ, Haffner SM |title=Disposition index, glucose effectiveness, and conversion to type 2 diabetes: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=2098–2103 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20805282 |pmc=2928371 |doi=10.2337/dc10-0165}}</ref>

The description of first phase release is as follows:
* Glucose enters the β-cells through the [[glucose transporters]], [[Glucose transporter|GLUT 2]]. At low blood sugar levels little glucose enters the β-cells; at high blood glucose concentrations large quantities of glucose enter these cells.<ref name=schuit>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, Moens K, Heimberg H, Pipeleers D | title = Cellular origin of hexokinase in pancreatic islets | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 46 | pages = 32803–09 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10551841 | publication-date = 1999 | doi=10.1074/jbc.274.46.32803| doi-access = free }}</ref>
* The glucose that enters the β-cell is phosphorylated to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] (G-6-P) by [[glucokinase]] ([[Hexokinase#Types of mammalian hexokinase|hexokinase IV]]) which is not inhibited by G-6-P in the way that the hexokinases in other tissues (hexokinase I – III) are affected by this product. This means that the intracellular G-6-P concentration remains proportional to the blood sugar concentration.<ref name=koeslag /><ref name=schuit />
* Glucose-6-phosphate enters [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]] and then, via the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] reaction, into the [[Krebs cycle]], where multiple, high-energy [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are produced by the oxidation of [[acetyl CoA]] (the Krebs cycle substrate), leading to a rise in the ATP:ADP ratio within the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, De Vos A, Farfari S, Moens K, Pipeleers D, Brun T, Prentki M | title = Metabolic fate of glucose in purified islet cells.

* An increased intracellular ATP:ADP ratio closes the ATP-sensitive SUR1/[[Kir6.2]] [[potassium channel]] (see [[sulfonylurea receptor]]). This prevents potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.
* Upon [[depolarization]], voltage-gated [[calcium channels|calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels]] open, allowing calcium ions to move into the cell by facilitated diffusion.
* The cytosolic calcium ion concentration can also be increased by calcium release from intracellular stores via activation of ryanodine receptors.<ref name="SP2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santulli G, Pagano G, Sardu C, Xie W, Reiken S, D'Ascia SL, Cannone M, Marziliano N, Trimarco B, Guise TA, Lacampagne A, Marks AR | title = Calcium release channel RyR2 regulates insulin release and glucose homeostasis | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 1968–78 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25844899 | doi = 10.1172/JCI79273 | pmc=4463204}}</ref>
* The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of [[phospholipase|phospholipase C]] resulting from the binding of an extracellular [[ligand]] (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a [[G protein]]-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, [[phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate]], into [[inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate]] and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). This allows the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration. [[Parasympathetic nervous system|Parasympathetic]] stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.<ref name=stryer1>{{cite book | vauthors = Stryer L | title = Biochemistry. |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

* The significantly increased amount of calcium ions in the cells' cytoplasm causes the release into the blood of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in intracellular [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]].

This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of [[acetylcholine]] (acting via the phospholipase C pathway), [[sulfonylurea]], [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK, also via phospholipase C),<ref name="pmid19922535">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cawston EE, Miller LJ | title = Therapeutic potential for novel drugs targeting the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–21 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19922535 | pmc = 2839260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00489.x }}</ref> and the gastrointestinally derived [[incretins]], such as [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) and [[glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide]] (GIP).

Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress.

When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently [[glucagon]] from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by [[gluconeogenesis]] if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the [[glucose tolerance test]], demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120&nbsp;mg/100 mL after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test. An insulin spike is a 'first response' to blood glucose increase, this response is individual and dose specific although it was always previously assumed to be food type specific only.

=== Signal transduction ===
The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor, [[Insulin receptor|the insulin receptor (IR)]], present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name="diabetesincontrol.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=28 July 2014|work=Diabetes In Control.

The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase ([[phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]]). This enzyme converts a [[phospholipid]] in the cell membrane by the name of [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2), into [[Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate|phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate]] (PIP3), which, in turn, activates [[AKT|protein kinase B]] (PKB).

* Induced glycogen synthesis – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/insulin_phys.html|title=Physiologic Effects of Insulin|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=1 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Degradation ===
Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell.

=== Regulator of endocannabinoid metabolism ===
Insulin is a major regulator of [[Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoid]] (EC) [[metabolism]] and insulin treatment has been shown to reduce [[intracellular]] ECs, the [[2-Arachidonoylglycerol|2-arachidonoylglycerol]] (2-AG) and [[anandamide]] (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant [[adipocyte]]s, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that [[Insulin resistance|insulin-resistant]] adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby [[Obesity|obese]] insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Eon TM, Pierce KA, Roix JJ, Tyler A, Chen H, Teixeira SR | title = The role of adipocyte insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of obesity-related elevations in endocannabinoids |language=en | journal = Diabetes | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 1262–68 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18276766 | doi = 10.2337/db07-1186 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid26374449">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatta-Cherifi B, Cota D | title = New insights on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of energy balance | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–19 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26374449 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.179 | s2cid = 20740277 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This dysregulation contributes to excessive [[Adipose tissue|visceral fat]] accumulation and reduced [[adiponectin]] release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Marzo V | title = The endocannabinoid system in obesity and type 2 diabetes | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 51 | issue = 8 | pages = 1356–67 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18563385 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-008-1048-2 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Diseases and syndromes ==
There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:
* [[Diabetes]] – general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia. It can be of the following types:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Macdonald IA | title = A review of recent evidence relating to sugars, insulin resistance and diabetes | journal = European Journal of Nutrition | volume = 55 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 17–23 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27882410 | pmc = 5174139 | doi = 10.1007/s00394-016-1340-8 }}</ref>
**[[Type 1 diabetes]] – autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency
** [[Type 2 diabetes]] – either inadequate insulin production by the β-cells or [[insulin resistance]] or both because of reasons not completely understood.
*** there is correlation with [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], with sedentary lifestyle, with [[obesity]], with age and with [[metabolic syndrome]]. Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys; importantly, non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet, sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors, though this may not be a causal relationship.
*** it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditions
** Other types of impaired glucose tolerance (see [[Diabetes]])
* [[Insulinoma]] – a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or [[reactive hypoglycemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guettier JM, Gorden P | title = Insulin secretion and insulin-producing tumors | journal = Expert Review of Endocrinology & Metabolism | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–227 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20401170 | pmc = 2853964 | doi = 10.1586/eem.09.83 }}</ref>
* [[Metabolic syndrome]] – a poorly understood condition first called syndrome X by [[Gerald Reaven]]. It is not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saklayen MG | title = The Global Epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome | journal = Current Hypertension Reports | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 12 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29480368 | pmc = 5866840 | doi = 10.1007/s11906-018-0812-z }}</ref>
* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] – a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where [[anovulation]] and [[androgen]] excess are commonly displayed as [[hirsutism]]. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = El Hayek S, Bitar L, Hamdar LH, Mirza FG, Daoud G | title = Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome: An Updated Overview | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 7 | pages = 124 | date = 5 April 2016 | pmid = 27092084 | pmc = 4820451 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2016.00124 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Several analogs of human insulin are available. These [[insulin analog]]s are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).<ref>[[Insulin analog]]</ref> The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), [[Humalog]] (insulin lispro),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vecchio I, Tornali C, Bragazzi NL, Martini M | title = The Discovery of Insulin: An Important Milestone in the History of Medicine | journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology | volume = 9 | pages = 613 | date = 23 October 2018 | pmid = 30405529 | pmc = 6205949 | doi = 10.3389/fendo.2018.00613 | doi-access = free }}</ref> it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15&nbsp;minutes after injection.

Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was [[Lantus]] (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24&nbsp;hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue ([[Levemir]]) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A [[myristic acid]] molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body's own insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulrich H, Snyder B, Garg SK | title = Combining insulins for optimal blood glucose control in type I and 2 diabetes: focus on insulin glulisine | journal = Vascular Health and Risk Management | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–54 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17703632 | pmc = 2293970 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silver B, Ramaiya K, Andrew SB, Fredrick O, Bajaj S, Kalra S, Charlotte BM, Claudine K, Makhoba A | title = EADSG Guidelines: Insulin Therapy in Diabetes | journal = Diabetes Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 449–492 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29508275 | pmc = 6104264 | doi = 10.1007/s13300-018-0384-6 }}</ref> Insulin is also used in many cell lines, such as CHO-s, HEK 293 or Sf9, for the manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, virus vaccines, and gene therapy products.<ref>{{Cite news|date=22 October 2021|title=Insulin Human for innovative biologics|newspaper=Novo Nordisk Pharmatech|url=https://novonordiskpharmatech.com/products/insulin-human-af/}}</ref>

Unlike many medicines, insulin cannot be taken [[Oral administration|by mouth]] because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], it is reduced to fragments, whereupon all activity is lost.

In 1869, while studying the structure of the [[pancreas]] under a [[microscope]], [[Paul Langerhans]], a medical student in [[Berlin]], identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakula A | title = Paul Langerhans (1847-1888): a centenary tribute | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 81 | issue = 7 | pages = 414–5 | date = July 1988 | pmid = 3045317 | pmc = 1291675 | doi = 10.1177/014107688808100718 }}</ref> The function of the "little heaps of cells", later [[eponym|known as]] the ''[[islets of Langerhans]]'', initially remained unknown, but [[Édouard Laguesse]] later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musee.chru-lille.fr/Memoire/Medecins/48029.html |title=Edouard Laguesse (1861–1927) | vauthors = Petit H |language=fr |website=Museum of the Regional Hospital of Lille |access-date=25 July 2018 }}</ref> Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role.

In 1889, the physician [[Oskar Minkowski]], in collaboration with [[Joseph von Mering]], removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist [[Eugene Lindsay Opie]], when he isolated the role of the pancreas to the islets of Langerhans: "Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed".<ref name="Johns Hopkins Hosp.

Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate the islets' secretions. In 1906 [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, [[Ernest Lyman Scott|E.L. Scott]] at the [[University of Chicago]] tried aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner (biochemist)|Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1915, but [[World War I]] interrupted his work and he did not return to it.<ref name="J.

In 1916, [[Nicolae Paulescu]] developed an [[aqueous]] [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] extract which, when injected into a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] dog, had a normalizing effect on [[blood sugar]] levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of [[World War I]], and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in [[Bucharest]] and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he published "Research on the Role of the [[Pancreas]] in Food Assimilation".<ref name="nrjs">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paulesco NC | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie |url= https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10137 | title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive|volume= 17|pages= 85–109| date=31 August 1921 }}

The name "insulin" was coined by [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer]] in 1916 for a hypothetical molecule produced by pancreatic islets of Langerhans (Latin ''insula'' for islet or island) that controls glucose metabolism. Unbeknown to Sharpey-Schafer, Jean de Meyer had introduced the very similar word "insuline" in 1909 for the same molecule.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = de Leiva A, Brugués E, de Leiva-Pérez A |date=2011|title=The discovery of insulin: Continued controversies after ninety years|journal=Endocrinología y Nutrición (English Edition)|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=449–456|doi=10.1016/j.endoen.2011.10.001}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vecchio I, Tornali C, Bragazzi NL, Martini M | title = The Discovery of Insulin: An Important Milestone in the History of Medicine | journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology | volume = 9 | pages = 613 | date = 23 October 2018 | pmid = 30405529 | pmc = 6205949 | doi = 10.3389/fendo.2018.00613 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Extraction and purification ===
In October 1920, Canadian [[Frederick Banting]] concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. A surgeon by training, Banting knew that blockages of the pancreatic duct would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone. He jotted a note to himself: "Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these + relieve glycosurea[sic]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AN10002|title=Note dated Oct 31/20 from loose leaf notebook 1920/21| vauthors = Banting FG |date=31 October 1920|website=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref><ref name="rosenfeld2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenfeld L | title = Insulin: discovery and controversy | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 2270–88 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12446492 | doi = 10.1093/clinchem/48.12.2270 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to [[Toronto]] to explain his idea to [[John Macleod (physiologist)|John Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Macleod was initially skeptical, since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature, but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas. Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting's lab assistants that summer, but Banting required only one lab assistant. [[Charles Best (medical scientist)|Charles Best]] and Clark Noble flipped a coin; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This proved unfortunate for Noble, as Banting kept Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best.<ref name="pmid12473641">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E.

Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.<ref name="rosenfeld2002"/>

On 11 January 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name="pmid8409364">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–74 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jhmas/article-pdf/48/3/253/9838324/253.pdf | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AC10024|title=Work on diabetes shows progress against disease| work = Toronto Star Weekly|date=14 January 1922| publisher = University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fletcher AA | title = Early clinical experiences with insulin | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 87 | pages = 1052–5 | date = November 1962 | issue = 20 | pmid = 13945508 | pmc = 1849803 | url = https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10053 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AM10015|title=Patient records for Leonard Thompson| vauthors = Banting FG |date=Dec 1921 – Jan 1922|website=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref> However, the extract was so impure that Thompson had a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were cancelled. Over the next 12&nbsp;days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract. A second dose was injected on 23 January, eliminating the [[glycosuria]] that was typical of diabetes without causing any obvious side-effects. The first American patient was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett|Elizabeth Hughes]], the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]].<ref name=miracle>{{cite news | vauthors = Zuger A | title = Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05insulin.html | quote = Elizabeth Hughes was a cheerful, pretty little girl, five feet tall, with straight brown hair and a consuming interest in birds.

Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper,{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} and Collip left the project soon after. Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.

=== Patent ===
Toward the end of January 1922, tensions mounted between the four "co-discoverers" of insulin and Collip briefly threatened to separately [[patent]] his purification process. [[John G. FitzGerald]], director of the non-commercial public health institution [[Connaught Laboratories]], therefore stepped in as peacemaker. The resulting agreement of 25 January 1922 established two key conditions: 1) that the collaborators would sign a contract agreeing not to take out a patent with a commercial pharmaceutical firm during an initial working period with Connaught; and 2) that no changes in research policy would be allowed unless first discussed among FitzGerald and the four collaborators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10033|title=Memorandum in reference to the co-operation of the Connaught Antitoxin Laboratories in the researches conducted by Dr. Banting, Mr. Best and Dr. Collip under the general direction of Professor J.J.R. Macleod to obtain an extract of pancreas having a specific effect on blood sugar concentration|last=University of Toronto Board of Governors Insulin Committee|date=25 January 1922|website=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref> It helped contain disagreement and tied the research to Connaught's public mandate.

Initially, Macleod and Banting were particularly reluctant to patent their process for insulin on grounds of [[medical ethics]]. However, concerns remained that a private third-party would hijack and monopolize the research (as [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had hinted<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Bliss M |title=The discovery of insulin |date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-05899-3|edition= 25th anniversary |location=Chicago|pages=132|oclc=74987867|quote=The Lilly company would be delighted to work with Toronto, [[George Henry Alexander Clowes|Clowes]] wrote, and hinted, perhaps intentionally, perhaps not, that Toronto could be bypassed: "I have thus far refrained from starting work in our laboratories on the field of this question as I was anxious to avoid in any way intruding on the field of yourself and your associates until you had published your results. I feel, however, that the matter is now one of such immediate importance that we should take up the experimental end of the question without delay, preferably cooperating with you and your associates..."}}</ref>), and that safe distribution would be difficult to guarantee without capacity for quality control. To this end, [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] gave valuable advice. He had isolated [[thyroxin]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1914 and patented the process through an arrangement between himself, the brothers Mayo, and the [[University of Minnesota]], transferring the patent to the public university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10262|title=Letter to Dr. J.

Hans E. Weber discovered preproinsulin while working as a research fellow at the University of California Los Angeles in 1974. In 1973–1974, Weber learned the techniques of how to isolate, purify, and translate messenger RNA. To further investigate insulin, he obtained pancreatic tissues from a slaughterhouse in Los Angeles and then later from animal stock at UCLA. He isolated and purified total messenger RNA from pancreatic islet cells which was then translated in oocytes from ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'' and precipitated using anti-insulin antibodies. When total translated protein was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient, peaks corresponding to insulin and proinsulin were isolated. However, to the surprise of Weber a third peak was isolated corresponding to a molecule larger than proinsulin. After reproducing the experiment several times, he consistently noted this large peak prior to proinsulin that he determined must be a larger precursor molecule upstream of proinsulin. In May 1975, at the American Diabetes Association meeting in New York, Weber gave an oral presentation of his work<ref>Weber, H.E. (1975) Diabetes 24, 405. (see figure)</ref> where he was the first to name this precursor molecule "preproinsulin". Following this oral presentation, Weber was invited to dinner to discuss his paper and findings by [[Donald Steiner]], a researcher who contributed to the characterization of proinsulin.  A year later in April 1976, this molecule was further characterized and sequenced by Steiner, referencing the work and discovery of Hans Weber.<ref>Chan SJ, Keim P, Steiner DF.  Cell-free synthesis of rat preproinsulins: Characterization and partial amino acid sequence determination.  Proc Natl Acad Sci. USA 1976;73:1964-1968.</ref> Preproinsulin became an important molecule to study the process of transcription and translation.

The first genetically engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced using [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] in 1978 by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and [[Keiichi Itakura]] at the [[Beckman Research Institute]] of the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope]] in collaboration with [[Herbert Boyer]] at [[Genentech]].<ref name="urlGenentech" /><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin" /> Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and [[Eli Lilly and Company]], went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name [[Humulin]].<ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin"/> The vast majority of insulin used worldwide is biosynthetic recombinant "human" insulin or its analogues.<ref name="pmid23222785" /> Recently, another approach has been used by a pioneering group of Canadian researchers, using an easily grown [[safflower]] plant, for the production of much cheaper insulin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/new-source-of-insulin-blossoming-on-the-prairies-1.479043|title=Safflowers may provide new insulin source {{!}} CTV News|website=www.ctvnews.ca|access-date=12 November 2019|date=February 2010}}</ref>

Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually ''[[baker's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') or ''E. coli''.<ref name="pmid11030562">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kjeldsen T | title = Yeast secretory expression of insulin precursors | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–86 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030562 | doi = 10.1007/s002530000402 | s2cid = 9246671 | url = http://w3.ualg.pt/~jvarela/biotecnol/pdf/humaninsulin.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170927000623/http://w3.ualg.pt/~jvarela/biotecnol/pdf/humaninsulin.pdf | archive-date = 27 September 2017 }}</ref> In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a C-terminally truncated insulin B chain.  A chemically synthesized C-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the C-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with C-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.

=== Nobel Prizes ===

The [[Nobel Prize]] committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the [[University of Toronto]] and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John Macleod (physiologist)|John Macleod]].<ref name="urlThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, incensed that Best was not mentioned,<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Felman A | date = 22 November 2018 | title = Who discovered insulin? | work = Medical News Today | url = https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323774.php}}</ref> shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with [[James Collip]]. The patent for insulin was sold to the [[University of Toronto]] for one dollar.

Two other Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on insulin. British molecular biologist [[Frederick Sanger]], who determined the [[primary structure]] of insulin in 1955, was awarded the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref name="Stretton_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stretton AO | title = The first sequence. Fred Sanger and insulin | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 527–32 | date = October 2002 | doi = 10.1093/genetics/162.2.527 | pmid = 12399368 | pmc = 1462286 }}</ref> [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] for insulin.

Several Nobel Prizes also have an indirect connection with insulin. [[George Minot]], co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for [[pernicious anemia]], had [[diabetes]]. [[William Bosworth Castle|William Castle]] observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for [[pernicious anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WB | title = The Gordon Wilson Lecture. A Century of Curiosity About Pernicious Anemia | journal = Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume = 73 | pages = 54–80 | year = 1962 | pmid = 21408623 | pmc = 2249021 | author-link = William Bosworth Castle }}</ref> [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of [[crystallography]], the technique she used for deciphering the complete molecular structure of insulin in 1969.<ref name=":2" />

==== Controversy ====

The work published by Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients.<ref name="pmid20314060">{{cite journal | vauthors = Banting FG, Best CH, Collip JB, Campbell WR, Fletcher AA | title = Pancreatic Extracts in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–46 | date = March 1922 | pmid = 20314060 | pmc = 1524425 }}</ref> Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment, his saline extract could not be used on humans; he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize. Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct "the historical wrong" against [[Nicolae Paulescu]]. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the [[International Diabetes Federation]]. Murray wrote:

{{blockquote|Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu, the distinguished [[Romania]]n scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.<ref name="pmid4560502">{{cite journal | vauthors = Drury MI | title = The golden jubile of insulin | journal = Journal of the Irish Medical Association | volume = 65 | issue = 14 | pages = 355–63 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4560502 }}</ref>
}}

In a private communication, [[Arne Tiselius]], former head of the Nobel Institute, expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923.<ref name="pmid4930788">{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray I | title = Paulesco and the isolation of insulin | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–57 | date = April 1971 | pmid = 4930788 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/XXVI.2.150 }}</ref>
