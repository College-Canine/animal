'''Struvite''' ([[magnesium]] [[ammonium phosphate]]) is a [[phosphate mineral]] with formula: NH<sub>4</sub>MgPO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O. Struvite crystallizes in the [[orthorhombic]] system as white to yellowish or brownish-white pyramidal crystals or in platy [[mica]]-like forms. It is a soft mineral with [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.5 to 2 and has a low [[specific gravity]] of 1.7. It is sparingly soluble in neutral and alkaline conditions, but readily soluble in acid.

Struvite urinary stones and crystals form readily in the urine of animals and humans that are infected with [[ammonia]]-producing organisms. They are potentiated by alkaline urine and high magnesium excretion (high magnesium/plant-based diets). They also are potentiated by a specific urinary protein in domestic cats.

==Name==
Although struvite was briefly mentioned in Hooke's Micrographia,<ref>Witty, M (2016).  Hooke’s Gravel was Struvite.  Notes and Queries 63(4):569–570.  https://doi.org/10.1093/notesj/gjw218
</ref> it was first described in detail in 1845 by the German chemist {{Interlanguage link multi|Georg Ludwig Ulex|de|lt=Georg Ludwig Ulex}} (1811–1883), who found crystals of struvite in what he surmised had once been a [[medieval]] [[midden]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]; he named the new mineral after the geographer and geologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrich von Struve|de|lt=Heinrich Christian Gottfried von Struve}} (1772–1851) of Hamburg.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulex GL | date = 1845 | url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077853219;view=1up;seq=120 | title = On struvite, a new mineral | journal = Memoirs and Proceedings of the Chemical Society | volume = 3 | pages = 106–110 | doi = 10.1039/mp8450300106 }}</ref><ref name=Webmineral/>

==Occurrence==
Struvite readily forms in alkaline conditions where its constituent ions are present. In nature, it forms primarily in areas associated with organic matter decomposition, including [[guano]] deposits, basaltic caves, and [[marshland]]s. Similar conditions are found when human bladders are infected by urease-producing bacteria, when wastewater is treated, etc.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Tian-Lei |last2=Li |first2=Han |last3=Jiang |first3=Hao-Fan |last4=Yao |first4=Qi-Zhi |last5=Huang |first5=Ying |last6=Zhou |first6=Gen-Tao |title=Morphogenesis and evolution mechanisms of bacterially-induced struvite |journal=Scientific Reports |date=December 2021 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=170 |doi=10.1038/s41598-020-80718-y|pmid=33420384 |pmc=7794283 }}</ref>

===Struvite kidney stones===
Also known as triple phosphate stone (calcium magnesium ammonium phosphate).<ref>{{Citation |last1=Karki |first1=Niraj |title=Struvite and Triple Phosphate Renal Calculi |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568783/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2024-01-16 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=33760542 |last2=Leslie |first2=Stephen W.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Griffith |first=Donald P. |date=1978-05-01 |title=Struvite stones |journal=Kidney International |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=372–382 |doi=10.1038/ki.1978.55 |issn=0085-2538|doi-access=free |pmid=351265 }}</ref> Struvite precipitates in alkaline [[urine]], forming [[kidney stones]].

}}</ref> and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. Struvite stones are potentiated by [[bacterial]] infection that hydrolyzes [[urea]] to [[ammonium]] and raises urine [[pH]] to neutral or alkaline values. Urea-splitting organisms include ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'', ''[[Xanthomonas]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Klebsiella]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma]]''.

Even in the absence of infection, accumulation of struvite crystals in the [[urinary bladder]] is a problem frequently seen in [[cat|housecats]], with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for [[constipation]]) or blood in the urine ([[hematuria]]). The protein [[cauxin]], a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumoto K, Funaba M | title = Factors affecting struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) crystallization in feline urine | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1780 | issue = 2 | pages = 233–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17976920 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2007.09.013 }}</ref> In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones.<ref name="pmid9868260">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith BH, Stevenson AE, Markwell PJ | title = Urinary relative supersaturations of calcium oxalate and struvite in cats are influenced by diet | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 128 | issue = 12 Suppl | pages = 2763S–2764S | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9868260 | doi = 10.1093/jn/128.12.2763S | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Upper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least 2 calyces are classified as staghorn calculi. Although all types of urinary stones can potentially form staghorn calculi, approximately 75% are composed of a struvite-carbonate-apatite matrix.

===Struvite enteroliths===
Struvite is a common mineral found in [[enterolith]]s (intestinal concretions) in [[horse]]s.<ref name="pmid7251465">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blue MG, Wittkopp RW | title = Clinical and structural features of equine enteroliths | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 179 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–82 | date = July 1981 | pmid = 7251465 }}</ref>

===Wastewater treatment===
Struvite can be a problem in [[sewage]] and waste water treatment, particularly after anaerobic digesters release ammonium and phosphate from waste material. Struvite can form a scale on lines and belts, in centrifuges and pumps, clog system pipes and other equipment including the anaerobic digester itself. Struvite, also referred to as MAP, forms when there is a mole to mole to mole ratio (1:1:1) of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate in the wastewater. The magnesium can be found in soil, seawater as well as drinking water. Ammonia is broken down from the urea in wastewater, and phosphate, which is found through food, soaps and detergents. These elements in place, struvite is more likely to form in a high pH environment, where there is higher conductivity, lower temperatures, and higher concentrations of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate. Recovery of phosphorus from wastestreams as struvite and recycling those nutrients into agriculture as [[fertilizer]] appears promising, particularly in agricultural manure and municipal [[waste water treatment plants]].

[[File:Struvite. Clogged sewer pipes.jpg|thumb|Struvite. Clogged sewer pipes]]
Having struvite scale in a [[wastewater treatment]] system can lead to great inefficiency within the plant or operation due to clogging of the pipes, pumps and equipment. There have been a few options to solve this issue, including replacing the pipes, or using a hydro-jetter or a mechanical grinder to clear them. But many lines can be underground and either of these options implies considerable downtime and labor. Chemical cleaning is now predominately used to clear systems of struvite. Chemical cleaning products have been developed to remove and prevent struvite with minimal downtime. Even a chemical-free, electric method of removing and preventing struvite has been developed and tested successfully at wastewater treatment plants in the USA. The electronic sine wave it produces is sent through the water in the pipe and is therefore effective on underground piping as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RT, Moody LB, Walker FR | title = Laboratory and in-situ reductions of soluble phosphorus in swine waste slurries | journal = Environmental Technology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 1273–8 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11804348 | doi = 10.1080/09593332208618190 | bibcode = 2001EnvTe..22.1273B | s2cid = 25433506 | url = http://www.stormwater.ucf.edu/chemicaltreatment/documents/Burns%20et%20al.,%202001.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120327181220/http://www.stormwater.ucf.edu/chemicaltreatment/documents/Burns%20et%20al.,%202001.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-03-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sewage-plant-carries-sweet-smell-of-phosphorus/article785525/ |title= Sewage plant carries sweet smell of phosphorus |first = Mark | last = Hume | name-list-style = vanc |newspaper=The Globe And Mail |access-date=2014-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://vancouversun.com/news/metro/reclaiming-minerals-from-waste-water-to-make-fertilizer |title=Reclaiming minerals from waste water to make fertilizer |first = Brian | last = Morton | name-list-style = vanc |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |access-date=2013-06-05}}</ref>

==Uses==
{{see also|Reuse of human excreta#Urine}}
Use of struvite as an agricultural [[fertilizer]] was first described in 1857. It contains P and N, two of the three major [[plant nutrition|plant macronutrient]]s, with Mg being a minor macronutrient as well. Struvite can be produced from urine by adjusting pH (often just by waiting for urease-producing bacteria to work) and adding magnesium.<ref name=Wald>{{cite journal |last1=Wald |first1=Chelsea |title=The urine revolution: how recycling pee could help to save the world |journal=Nature |date=10 February 2022 |volume=602 |issue=7896 |pages=202–206 |doi=10.1038/d41586-022-00338-6|pmid=35140393 |bibcode=2022Natur.602..202W |s2cid=246700356 |doi-access= }}</ref> There is considerable interest in the utility of urine-derived struvite as a fertilizer in austere situations.<ref>{{cite thesis
