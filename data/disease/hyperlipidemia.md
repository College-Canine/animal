'''Hyperlipidemia''' is abnormally high levels of any or all [[lipid]]s (e.g. [[fat]]s, [[triglyceride]]s, [[cholesterol]], [[phospholipid]]s) or [[lipoprotein]]s in the [[blood]].<ref name=DorlandAndAmericanHeritage>{{cite web | title = Hyperlipidemia | url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hyperlipidemia | work = The Free Dictionary }} citing: {{cite book | title = Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers | date = 2007 | publisher = Saunders }} and {{cite book | title = The American Heritage Medical Dictionary | url = https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00ahde | url-access = registration | date = 2007 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| isbn = 978-0618824359 }}</ref> The term ''hyperlipidemia'' refers to the laboratory finding itself and is also used as an umbrella term covering any of various acquired or genetic disorders that result in that finding.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title=Hyperlipidemia {{!}} Society for Vascular Surgery|url=https://vascular.org/patient-resources/vascular-conditions/hyperlipidemia|website=vascular.org|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> Hyperlipidemia represents a subset of [[dyslipidemia]] and a superset of [[hypercholesterolemia]]. Hyperlipidemia is usually chronic and requires ongoing  medication to control blood lipid levels.<ref name=":8" />

Lipids (water-insoluble molecules) are transported in a [[Apolipoprotein|protein]] [[Lipoprotein|capsule]].<ref name=":7">{{cite book |title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology |last=Hall | first = John E. | name-list-style = vanc |date= 2016 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1455770052 |oclc=932195756 }}</ref> The size of that capsule, or [[lipoprotein]], determines its density.<ref name=":7" /> The lipoprotein density and type of [[apolipoprotein]]s it contains determines the fate of the particle and its influence on [[metabolism]].

Hyperlipidemias are divided into primary and secondary subtypes. Primary hyperlipidemia is usually due to genetic causes (such as a mutation in a receptor protein), while secondary hyperlipidemia arises due to other underlying causes such as [[diabetes]]. Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are common in the general population and are regarded as modifiable risk factors for [[cardiovascular disease]] due to their influence on [[atherosclerosis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pathophysiology of heart disease : a collaborative project of medical students and faculty|last=Lilly | first = Leonard |year=2015 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer | name-list-style = vanc |isbn=978-1496308696|oclc=1052840871}}</ref> In addition, some forms may predispose to [[acute pancreatitis]].

Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated, that is [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[hypertriglyceridemia]] or both in [[combined hyperlipidemia]].

==== Type I ====
{{anchor|type I}}
Type I hyperlipoproteinemia exists in several forms:
* [[Lipoprotein lipase deficiency|Lipoprotein lipase deficiency (type Ia)]], due to a deficiency of [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) or altered [[apolipoprotein C2]], resulting in elevated [[chylomicron]]s, the particles that transfer fatty acids from the [[digestive tract]] to the [[liver]]
* Familial apoprotein CII deficiency (type Ib),<ref>{{OMIM|207750|Apolipoprotein C-II Deficency}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamura T, Sudo H, Ishikawa K, Yamamoto A | title = Familial type I hyperlipoproteinemia caused by apolipoprotein C-II deficiency | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–65 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 227429 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9150(79)90106-0 | hdl = 11094/32883 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> a condition caused by a lack of lipoprotein lipase activator.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book | last1 = James | first1 = William D. | last2 = Berger | first2 = Timothy G. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{rp|533}}
* Chylomicronemia due to circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (type Ic)<ref>{{OMIM|118830|Chylomicronemia, Familial, Due to Circulating Inhibitor of Lipoprotein Lipase}}</ref>

Type I hyperlipoproteinemia usually presents in childhood with eruptive xanthomata and abdominal colic. Complications include retinal vein occlusion, acute pancreatitis, steatosis, and organomegaly, and lipemia retinalis.

==== Type II ====
Hyperlipoproteinemia type II is further classified into types IIa and IIb, depending mainly on whether elevation in the triglyceride level occurs in addition to LDL cholesterol.

===== Type IIa =====
{{main|Familial hypercholesterolemia}}

This may be sporadic (due to dietary factors), polygenic, or truly familial as a result of a mutation either in the [[LDL receptor]] gene on [[chromosome 19]] (0.2% of the population) or the [[apolipoprotein B|ApoB]] gene (0.2%). The familial form is characterized by [[Xanthoma|tendon xanthoma]], [[xanthelasma]], and premature cardiovascular disease.  The incidence of this disease is about one in 500 for heterozygotes, and one in 1,000,000 for homozygotes.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

HLPIIa is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood due to the lack of uptake (no Apo B receptors) of LDL particles. This pathology, however, is the second-most common disorder of the various hyperlipoproteinemias, with individuals with a heterozygotic predisposition of one in every 500 and individuals with homozygotic predisposition of one in every million. These individuals may present with a unique set of physical characteristics such as xanthelasmas (yellow deposits of fat underneath the skin often presenting in the nasal portion of the eye), tendon and tuberous xanthomas, arcus juvenilis (the graying of the eye often characterized in older individuals), arterial bruits, claudication, and of course atherosclerosis. Laboratory findings for these individuals are significant for total serum cholesterol levels two to three times greater than normal, as well as increased LDL cholesterol, but their triglycerides and VLDL values fall in the normal ranges.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

To manage persons with HLPIIa, drastic measures may need to be taken, especially if their HDL cholesterol levels are less than 30&nbsp;mg/dL and their LDL levels are greater than 160&nbsp;mg/dL. A proper diet for these individuals requires a decrease in total fat to less than 30% of total calories with a ratio of monounsaturated:polyunsaturated:saturated fat of 1:1:1. Cholesterol should be reduced to less than 300&nbsp;mg/day, thus the avoidance of animal products and to increase fiber intake to more than 20 g/day with 6g of soluble fiber/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harada-Shiba|first1=Mariko|last2=Ohta|first2=Takao|last3=Ohtake|first3=Akira|last4=Ogura|first4=Masatsune|last5=Dobashi|first5=Kazushige|last6=Nohara|first6=Atsushi|last7=Yamashita|first7=Shizuya|last8=Yokote|first8=Koutaro|last9=Joint Working Group by Japan Pediatric Society and Japan Atherosclerosis Society for Making Guidance of Pediatric Familial Hypercholesterolemia|date=2018-06-01|title=Guidance for Pediatric Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017|journal=Journal of Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis|volume=25|issue=6|pages=539–553|doi=10.5551/jat.CR002|issn=1880-3873|pmc=6005224|pmid=29415907}}</ref> Exercise should be promoted, as it can increase HDL. The overall prognosis for these individuals is in the worst-case scenario if uncontrolled and untreated individuals may die before the age of 20, but if one seeks a prudent diet with correct medical intervention, the individual may see an increased incidence of xanthomas with each decade, and Achilles tendinitis and accelerated atherosclerosis will occur.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

===== Type IIb =====
The high VLDL levels are due to overproduction of substrates, including triglycerides, acetyl-CoA, and an increase in B-100 synthesis. They may also be caused by the decreased clearance of LDL. Prevalence in the population is 10%.{{cn|date=June 2021}}
* Familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia (FCH)
* [[Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency]] (often called [[Cholesteryl ester storage disease]])
* Secondary combined hyperlipoproteinemia (usually in the context of [[metabolic syndrome]], for which it is a diagnostic criterion)

==== Type III ====
This form is due to high [[chylomicron]]s and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein). Also known as ''broad beta disease'' or ''dysbetalipoproteinemia'', the most common cause for this form is the presence of [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE]] E2/E2 genotype. It is due to cholesterol-rich VLDL (β-VLDL). Its prevalence has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 10,000.<ref name=fung2011/>

It is associated with hypercholesterolemia (typically 8–12&nbsp;mmol/L), hypertriglyceridemia (typically 5–20&nbsp;mmol/L), a normal ApoB concentration, and two types of skin signs (palmar xanthomata or orange discoloration of skin creases, and tuberoeruptive xanthomata on the elbows and knees). It is characterized by the early onset of cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Remnant hyperlipidemia occurs as a result of abnormal function of the ApoE receptor, which is normally required for clearance of chylomicron remnants and IDL from the circulation. The receptor defect causes levels of chylomicron remnants and IDL to be higher than normal in the blood stream. The receptor defect is an autosomal recessive mutation or polymorphism.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

==== Type IV ====
[[Familial hypertriglyceridemia]] is an autosomal dominant condition occurring in approximately 1% of the population.<ref name=Boman1975>Boman H, Hazzard WR, AlbersJJ, et ah Frequency of monogenic forms of hyperlipidemia in a normal population. AmJ ttum Genet 27:19A,1975. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762895/pdf/ajhg00439-0130.pdf]</ref>

This form is due to high [[triglyceride]] level. Other lipoprotein levels are normal or increased a little.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

Treatment include diet control, [[fibrate]]s and niacins. [[Statin]]s are not better than fibrates when lowering triglyceride levels.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

==== Type V ====
{{anchor|type V}}Hyperlipoproteinemia type V, also known as mixed hyperlipoproteinemia familial or mixed hyperlipidemia,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?s=type+5+hyperlipidemia | title=Medical Definition Search For 'Type 5 Hyperlipidemia | publisher=medilexicon | access-date=1 November 2013}}</ref> is very similar to type I, but with high [[VLDL]] in addition to chylomicrons.

It is also associated with glucose intolerance and hyperuricemia.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

In medicine, combined hyperlipidemia (or -aemia) (also known as "multiple-type hyperlipoproteinemia") is a commonly occurring form of hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels) characterized by increased LDL and triglyceride concentrations, often accompanied by decreased HDL.<ref name=Elsevier>{{cite web | title = Hyperlipidemia  | url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hyperlipidemia | work = The Free Dictionary }} Citing: {{cite book | title = Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary | url = https://archive.org/details/saunderscomprehe00doug | url-access = registration | edition = 3rd | date = 2007 | publisher = Elsevier }}</ref> On lipoprotein electrophoresis (a test now rarely performed) it shows as a hyperlipoproteinemia type IIB. It is the most common inherited lipid disorder, occurring in about one in 200 persons. In fact, almost one in five individuals who develop coronary heart disease before the age of 60 has this disorder.
The elevated triglyceride levels (>5&nbsp;mmol/L) are generally due to an increase in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), a class of lipoprotein prone to cause atherosclerosis.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

Both conditions are treated with fibrate drugs, which act on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARα, to decrease free fatty acid production.
Statin drugs, especially the synthetic statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) can decrease LDL levels by increasing hepatic reuptake of LDL due to increased LDL-receptor expression.

==== Unclassified familial forms ====
These unclassified forms are extremely rare:
* [[Hyperalphalipoproteinemia]]
* [[Polygenic hypercholesterolemia]]

=== Acquired (secondary) ===
Acquired hyperlipidemias (also called secondary dyslipoproteinemias) often mimic primary forms of hyperlipidemia and can have similar consequences.<ref name=Chait/> They may result in increased risk of premature [[atherosclerosis]] or, when associated with marked [[hypertriglyceridemia]], may lead to [[pancreatitis]] and other complications of the [[chylomicronemia syndrome]].<ref name=Chait/> The most common causes of acquired hyperlipidemia are:
* [[Diabetes mellitus]]<ref name=Chait/>
* Use of drugs such as [[thiazide diuretics]],<ref name=Chait/> [[beta blockers]],<ref name=Chait/> and [[estrogens]]<ref name=Chait/>

Other conditions leading to acquired hyperlipidemia include:
* [[Hypothyroidism]]<ref name=Chait/>
* [[Kidney failure]]<ref name=Chait/>
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]]<ref name=Chait/>
* [[Alcohol consumption]]<ref name=Chait/>
* Some rare [[endocrine disorder]]s<ref name=Chait/> and [[metabolic disorders]]<ref name=Chait/>
Treatment of the underlying condition, when possible, or discontinuation of the offending drugs usually leads to an improvement in the hyperlipidemia.

Another acquired cause of hyperlipidemia, although not always included in this category, is postprandial hyperlipidemia, a normal increase following ingestion of food.<ref name="Elsevier"/><ref name="BioMed Central">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ansar S, Koska J, Reaven PD | title = Postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk: focus on incretins | journal = Cardiovascular Diabetology | volume = 10 | pages = 61 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21736746 | pmc = 3184260 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2840-10-61 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== HDL cholesterol ===

HDL, also known as "good cholesterol", is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref name=":5" /> HDL cholesterol carries cholesterol from other parts of the body back to the liver and then removes the cholesterol from the body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HDL: The "Good" Cholesterol|url=https://medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> It can be affected by acquired or genetic factors, including tobacco use, [[obesity]], inactivity, hypertriglyceridemia, [[diabetes]], high carbohydrate diet, medication side effects ([[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], androgenic steroids, corticosteroids, progestogens, [[thiazide]] diuretics, [[retinoic acid]] derivatives, oral estrogens, etc.) and genetic abnormalities (mutations ApoA-I, LCAT, ABC1).<ref name=":2" /> Low level is defined as less than 40 mg/dL.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279318/|title=High cholesterol: Overview|last=Information|first=National Center for Biotechnology |date=2017-09-07|publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG)|language=en}}</ref>

=== Triglycerides ===
Triglyceride level is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and/or [[metabolic syndrome]].<ref name=":2" /> Food intake prior to testing may cause elevated levels, up to 20%.

=== Screening age ===
Health organizations does not have a consensus on the age to begin screening for hyperlipidemia.<ref name=":2" /> The CDC recommends cholesterol screenings once between ages 9 and 11, once again between 17 and 21, and every 4 to 6 years in adulthood.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|title=Cholesterol Screenings|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/cholesterol-screenings/index.html|last=CDC|date=2018-09-07|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> Doctors may recommend more frequent screenings for people with a family history of early heart attacks, heart disease, or if a child has obesity or diabetes.<ref name=":13" /> [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|USPSTF]] recommends men older than 35 and women older than 45 to be screened.<ref name="pmid27532917">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bibbins-Domingo K, Grossman DC, Curry SJ, Davidson KW, Epling JW, García FA, Gillman MW, Kemper AR, Krist AH, Kurth AE, Landefeld CS, LeFevre M, Mangione CM, Owens DK, Phillips WR, Phipps MG, Pignone MP, Siu AL | display-authors = 6 | title = Screening for Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 316 | issue = 6 | pages = 625–633 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27532917 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.9852 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web |url= https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/lipid-disorders-in-adults-cholesterol-dyslipidemia-screening |title= Final Update Summary: Lipid Disorders in Adults (Cholesterol, Dyslipidemia): Screening |work= US Preventive Services Task Force |access-date= 2019-11-07 |archive-date= 2019-09-05 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190905133712/https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/lipid-disorders-in-adults-cholesterol-dyslipidemia-screening |url-status= dead }}</ref> NCE-ATP III recommends all adults older than 20 to be screened as it may lead potential lifestyle modification that can reduce risks of other diseases.<ref>{{cite web  | first =  Scott M. | last = Grundy | name-list-style = vanc |url= https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2014/07/18/16/03/then-and-now-atp-iii-vs-iv |title=Then and Now: ATP III vs. IV| work = American College of Cardiology|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>  However, screening should be done for those with known CHD or risk-equivalent conditions (e.g. [[Acute coronary syndrome|Acute Coronary Syndrome]], history of heart attacks, Stable or Unstable [[angina]], [[Transient ischemic attack]]s, [[Peripheral artery disease|Peripheral arterial disease]] of atherosclerotic origins, coronary or other arterial revascularization).<ref name=":2" />

=== Screening frequency ===
Adults 20 years and older should have the cholesterol checked every four to six years,<ref name=":11" /> and most screening guidelines recommends testing every 5 years.<ref name=":2" /> [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|USPSTF]] recommends increased frequency for people with elevated risk of CHD, which may be determined using cardiovascular disease risk scores.<ref name=":3" />

== Management ==
{{main|Lipid-lowering agent}}
Management of hyperlipidemia includes maintenance of a normal body weight, increased physical activity, and decreased consumption of refined carbohydrates and simple sugars.<ref name="michos">{{cite journal | vauthors = Michos ED, McEvoy JW, Blumenthal RS | title = Lipid Management for the Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 381 | issue = 16 | pages = 1557–1567 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31618541 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1806939 | s2cid = 204756336 | editor-first = John A. | editor-last = Jarcho }}</ref> [[Prescription drug]]s may be used to treat some people having significant [[risk factor]]s,<ref name=michos/> such as [[cardiovascular disease]], LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg/dL or diabetes.

=== HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ===

Competitive inhibitors of [[HMG-CoA reductase]], such as lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin, inhibit the synthesis of [[mevalonate]], a precursor molecule to cholesterol.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Basic and Clinical Pharmacology; 14th Edition|last=Katzung | first = Bertram G. | name-list-style = vanc|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education / Medical |isbn=978-1259641152|oclc=1048625746|year= 2017}}</ref> This medication class is especially effective at decreasing elevated LDL cholesterol.<ref name=":6" /> Major [[side effect]]s include elevated [[transaminase]]s and [[myopathy]].<ref name=":6" />

=== Fibric acid derivatives ===

Fibric acid derivatives, such as [[gemfibrozil]] and [[fenofibrate]], function by increasing the lipolysis in adipose tissue via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α.<ref name=":6" /> They decrease VLDL – [[very low density lipoprotein]] – and LDL in some people.<ref name=":6" />  Major side effects include rashes, GI upset, myopathy, or increased transaminases.<ref name=":6" />

=== Niacin ===

Niacin, or vitamin B<sub>3</sub> has a mechanism of action that is poorly understood, however it has been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increase HDL cholesterol.<ref name=":6" />  The most common side effect is flushing secondary to [[skin]] [[vasodilation]].<ref name=":6" /> This effect is mediated by [[prostaglandin]]s and can be decreased by taking concurrent [[aspirin]].<ref name=":6" />

=== Bile acid binding resins ===

[[Bile acid]] binding [[resin]]s, such as [[colestipol]], [[cholestyramine]], and [[colesevelam]], function by binding bile acids, increasing their excretion.<ref name=":6" /> They are useful for decreasing LDL cholesterol.<ref name=":6" /> The most common side effects include bloating and diarrhea.<ref name=":6" />

=== Sterol absorption inhibitors ===

Inhibitors of intestinal [[sterol]] absorption, such as [[ezetimibe]], function by decreasing the absorption of cholesterol in the GI tract by targeting [[NPC1L1]], a [[transport protein]] in the [[gastrointestinal wall]].<ref name=":6" /> This results in decreased LDL cholesterol.<ref name=":6" />

== Prevention ==
[[Smoking cessation|Quitting smoking]], lowering intake of [[saturated fat]] and alcohol, losing excess body weight, and eating a low-salt diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce blood cholesterol.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":11" /><ref name=":12" />
