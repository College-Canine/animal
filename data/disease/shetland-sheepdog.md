The '''Shetland Sheepdog''', also known as the '''Sheltie''', is a breed of [[herding dog]] that originated in the [[Shetland Islands]] of [[Scotland]]. It was formally recognized by [[The Kennel Club]] in 1909. It was originally called the '''''Shetland Collie''''', but this caused controversy amongst [[Rough Collie]] breeders of the time, so the name was changed.<ref name="herbert"/> It is a small dog, clever, vocal, willing to please, and trustworthy. 

Like the [[Shetland pony]], [[Shetland cattle]] and the [[Shetland sheep]], the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of [[Shetland Islands|its native islands]]. While the Shetland still excels at [[herding]], today it is often raised as a working dog and/or family pet.<ref>"Shetland sheepdog." ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. Credo Reference. Web. 17 September 2012.</ref>

The Shetland's origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the [[Rough Collie]], which it largely resembles. Rather, the Shetland is a descendant of small specimens of the [[Scotch Collie|Scottish Collie]] and the [[King Charles Spaniel]]. They were originally a small [[mixed-breed dog]], often only about {{convert|8|to|12|in|cm|abbr=off|order=flip|0}} in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland [[herding dog]]s were of the [[Spitz]] type, and were crossed with [[Collie]]s from mainland Britain.<ref name="herbert">{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Beryl & Joan|title=The Shetland Sheepdog|year=1961|publisher=Arco Publishing Company, inc|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-668-03976-0}}</ref> In the early 20th century, James Loggie added a small [[Rough Collie]] to the [[breeding stock]], and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog.

==History==
[[Image:Shetland Sheepdog from 1915.JPG|thumb|Photograph of a Shetland Sheepdog from 1915|alt=|left]]
Unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed simply by [[selective breeding|selectively breeding]] the [[Rough Collie]] for smaller and smaller size. The original sheepdog of [[Shetland]] was a [[Spitz]]-type dog, probably similar to the modern [[Icelandic Sheepdog]].{{cn|date=March 2024}} Strong evidence suggests that this dog was bred with the ''Yakki'' an Icelandic dog that accompanied [[whaler]]s from [[Greenland]] who landed in the ports of the island. The Yakki was about {{convert|14|in|cm}} in height and usually black with tan or white markings. Many of the early Shetlands were black and white or black and tan and this colouring can still be see in the muzzle of some sables dogs today whose muzzles are referred to as "smutty muzzles". Folk tales also mention a [[King Charles Spaniel]] that came from a yacht. [[Pomeranian dog]] ancestry is likely given the appearance of the breed. The first club for the breed called for a dog similar to the Rough Collie except in size, the standard called for dogs to be no taller than {{convert|15|in|cm}}. Other clubs called for similar standards with the breed to essentially be a miniature. These standards led to people adding in collie blood to the breed to achieve said type. The [[Kennel Club]] originally refused to recognise the breed but later agreed to on the condition the name was changed from Shetland Collie due to opposition from collie breed clubs.<ref name="herbert" /> The original Spitz-type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for [[Herding dog|herding]] there by the Border Collie. Shetlands were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sheltie Talk|last1=McKinney|first1=Betty Jo|last2=Riesberg|first2=Barbara|publisher=Alpine Publications|year=1985|isbn=0-931866-17-0|location=Loveland, Colorado|page=2}}</ref>

When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog.<ref name="herbert" /><ref>{{cite book | last=McGowan | first=Charlotte Clem | title=The Shetland Sheepdog in America | publisher=Best Friends | year=1999}}</ref> During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type – in fact, the first English Shetland champion's dam, Gesta, was a rough Collie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Colliecross.html |title=Collie Crosses behind Shetland Sheepdogs |last=Bowling |first=Sue Ann |website=bowlingsite.mcf.com |access-date=21 October 2021}}</ref> The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Shetland by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Shetland being a female called Badenock Rose. The first Shetland to be registered by the [[American Kennel Club]] was "Lord Scott" in 1911.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/SheltieHistory.html |last=Bowling |first=Sue Ann |title=Shetland Sheepdog Breed History |website=bowlingsite.mcf.com |access-date=4 April 2011}}</ref>

==Appearance==
[[File:Sheltie 2.JPG|thumb|right|A sable Shetland Sheepdog]]
The general appearance of the Shetland is that of a miniature [[Rough Collie]].<ref name="herbert"/> They are a small and double coated dog with a well shaped head. They have a long coat which becomes short around the face giving it the appearance of a mane.

===Coat and colours===
[[File:ShetlandShpdogBlue2 wb.jpg|right|thumb|A blue merle Shetland Sheepdog]]
[[File:Shetland Sheepdog7.jpg|thumb|A ''bi-blue'' Shetland Sheepdog with blue eyes, caused by the merle factor]]
[[File:Blue Merle Shetland Sheepdog.jpg|thumb|Blue Merle Shetland Sheepdog]]
Shetlands have a double coat, which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The outer coat is made up of long hair and is "harsh-textured and straight". The undercoat is soft, short, and close to the skin. The long coat should produce the appearance of a mane. The face is smooth haired.<ref name="Standard">{{cite web |title=Shetland Sheepdog Standard |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breed-standards/pastoral/shetland-sheepdog/ |website=The Kennel Club |access-date=12 March 2024}}</ref>

Shetlands may come in the following colours.
*'''Sable'''&nbsp;– either clear or shaded sable ranging in colour from pale gold to mahogany. Wolf-sable and grey are undesirable colours.
*'''Tricolor'''&nbsp;– with intense black on the body and rich tan markings preferred.
* '''Blue merle''' – silvery blue with splashed and marbled black preferred. General effect of the coat must be blue. Rich tan markings are also preferred but there is no penalty for the absence of this. Strong black markings, slate or rusty tinges in the coat are highly undesirable.
* '''Black and white & black and tan'''<ref name="Standard"/>

White markings may appear on any coat besides black and tan but patches on the body are undesirable.<ref name="Standard"/>

===Height===
[[File:Sheltie Isle of Mull.jpg|thumb|246x246px|A 12-month-old Sheltie on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]]]]
The ideal height at the withers is 14{{frac|1|2}} inches (37 cms) for dogs and 14 inches (35.5 cm) for bitches. More than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in variation from these heights is undesirable.<ref name="Standard"/>

===Ears===
[[File:Chiot berger des shetland.JPG|thumb|A tri-color Shetland Sheepdog puppy. Tipped ears, i.e. partly folded upright ears, are a desirable trait.|alt=|left]]
The Shetland's ears are small and of moderate width at the base placed close on top of the head. When alert the ears are semi-erect and propped forward.<ref name="Standard"/>

===Eyes===
{{See also|Heterochromia}}
Eyes are of medium size and are almond shaped. Eyes are always dark brown except in dogs with merle coats where one or both of the eyes may be blue.<ref name="Standard"/>

===Head===
The head is refined without any exaggerations. The head has a long wedge tapering from the ears to nose. The [[occipital bone]] isn't prominent. The cheeks are flat to support a well roounded muzzle. The muzzle is of equal length to the skull, dividing at the corner of the eye. The [[mucocutaneous]] parts of the face are black in pigmentation.<ref name="Standard"/>

===Body===
Neck is well arched and muscular. Legs are muscular. The dog is slightly longer than it is tall with a deep chest.<ref name="Standard"/>

==Temperament==

According to Dr. [[Stanley Coren]], an expert on animal intelligence, the Shetland Sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs, ranking 6th out of 138 breeds tested. His research found that an average Shetland could understand a new command in fewer than five repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95% of the time or better.<ref>{{cite book | last=Coren | first=Stanley | title=The Intelligence of Dogs | publisher=Bantam Books | isbn=0-553-37452-4 | year=1995 | url=https://archive.org/details/intelligenceofdo00core}}</ref>
