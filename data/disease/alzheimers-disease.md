Subtle problems with the [[executive functions]] of [[attention|attentiveness]], [[planning]], flexibility, and [[abstraction|abstract thinking]], or impairments in [[semantic memory]] (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=pmid15324363 /> [[Apathy]] and depression can be seen at this stage, with apathy remaining as the most persistent symptom throughout the course of the disease.<ref name=Deardorff>{{cite book | vauthors = Deardorff WJ, Grossberg GT | title = Psychopharmacology of Neurologic Disease | chapter = Behavioral and psychological symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia | series = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 165 | pages = 5–32 | date = 2019 | publisher = Elsevier | pmid = 31727229 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-64012-3.00002-2 | isbn = 978-0-444-64012-3 | s2cid = 208037448 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice|year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0434-1 |vauthors=Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH|edition=6th|veditors=Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J |chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice}}</ref> [[Mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI) is often found to be a transitional stage between normal aging and [[dementia]].

===Early stage===
In people with Alzheimer's disease, the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, [[perception]] ([[agnosia]]), or execution of movements ([[apraxia]]) are more prominent than memory problems.<ref name=pmid10653284>{{cite journal | vauthors = Förstl H, Kurz A | title = Clinical features of Alzheimer's disease | journal = European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 249 | issue = 6 | pages = 288–290 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10653284 | doi = 10.1007/s004060050101 | s2cid = 26142779 }}</ref> Alzheimer's disease does not affect all memory capacities equally. [[long-term memory|Older memories]] of the person's life ([[episodic memory]]), facts learned ([[semantic memory]]), and [[implicit memory]] (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.<ref name=pmid1300219>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlesimo GA, Oscar-Berman M | title = Memory deficits in Alzheimer's patients: a comprehensive review | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–169 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1300219 | doi = 10.1007/BF01108841 | s2cid = 19548915 }}</ref><ref name=pmid8821346>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jelicic M, Bonebakker AE, Bonke B | title = Implicit memory performance of patients with Alzheimer's disease: a brief review | journal = International Psychogeriatrics | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–392 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8821346 | doi = 10.1017/S1041610295002134 | s2cid = 9419442 }}</ref>

[[primary progressive aphasia|Language problems]] are mainly characterised by a shrinking [[vocabulary]] and decreased word [[fluency]], leading to a general impoverishment of oral and [[written language]].<ref name=pmid10653284 /><ref name=pmid1856925>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taler V, Phillips NA | title = Language performance in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a comparative review | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–556 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18569251 | doi = 10.1080/13803390701550128 | s2cid = 37153159 }}</ref> In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.<ref name=pmid10653284 /><ref name=pmid1856925 /><ref name=pmid7967534>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank EM | title = Effect of Alzheimer's disease on communication function | journal = Journal of the South Carolina Medical Association | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 417–423 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7967534 }}</ref> While performing [[fine motor skill|fine motor tasks]] such as writing, drawing, or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ([[apraxia]]) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> As the disease progresses, people with Alzheimer's disease can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.<ref name=pmid10653284 />

===Middle stage===
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to [[Anomic aphasia|recall vocabulary]], which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ([[paraphasia]]s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.<ref name=pmid10653284 /><ref name=pmid7967534 /> Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and Alzheimer's disease progresses, so the risk of falling increases.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> [[Long-term memory]], which was previously intact, becomes impaired.<ref name=pmid10653284 />

Behavioral and [[neuropsychiatric]] changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are [[Wandering (dementia)|wandering]], [[irritability]] and [[emotional lability]], leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated [[aggression]], or resistance to caregiving.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> [[Sundowning]] can also appear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volicer L, Harper DG, Manning BC, Goldstein R, Satlin A | title = Sundowning and circadian rhythms in Alzheimer's disease | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–711 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11329390 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.704 | s2cid = 10492607 }}</ref> Approximately 30% of people with Alzheimer's disease develop [[Delusional misidentification syndrome|illusionary misidentifications]] and other [[delusion]]al symptoms.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations ([[anosognosia]]).<ref name=pmid10653284 /> [[Urinary incontinence]] can develop.<ref name=pmid10653284 /> These symptoms create [[stress (biology)|stress]] for relatives and caregivers, which can be reduced by moving the person from [[home care]] to other [[Nursing home|long-term care facilities]].<ref name=pmid10653284 /><ref name=pmid7806732>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gold DP, Reis MF, Markiewicz D, Andres D | title = When home caregiving ends: a longitudinal study of outcomes for caregivers of relatives with dementia | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–16 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7806732 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.1995.tb06235.x | s2cid = 29847950 }}</ref>

===Late stage===
[[File:Alzheimers brain.jpg|thumb|A normal brain on the left and a late-stage Alzheimer's brain on the right]]
During the final stage, known as the late-stage or severe stage, there is complete dependence on caregivers.<ref name=NIA2023/><ref name=NHS2018 /><ref name=pmid10653284 /> Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.<ref name=pmid10653284 /><ref name=pmid7967534 /> Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme [[apathy]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently; [[musculature|muscle mass]] and mobility deteriorates to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves.

Alzheimer's disease is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Every neuron has a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called ''tau'' stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In Alzheimer's disease, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.<ref name=pmid17604998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernández F, Avila J | title = Tauopathies | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 2219–2233 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17604998 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x | s2cid = 261121643 }}</ref> Pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through [[transposable element]] dysregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun W, Samimi H, Gamez M, Zare H, Frost B | title = Pathogenic tau-induced piRNA depletion promotes neuronal death through transposable element dysregulation in neurodegenerative tauopathies | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1038–1048 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30038280 | pmc = 6095477 | doi = 10.1038/s41593-018-0194-1 }}</ref> [[Necroptosis]] has also been reported as a mechanism of cell death in brain cells affected with tau tangles.<ref>Balusu S, Horré K, Thrupp N, Craessaerts K, Snellinx A, Serneels L, T'Syen D, Chrysidou I, Arranz AM, Sierksma A, Simrén J, Karikari TK, Zetterberg H, Chen WT, Thal DR, Salta E, Fiers M, De Strooper B.

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s.

===Diet===
Diet may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. The [[Mediterranean diet]], and the [[DASH diet]] are both associated with less cognitive decline.

==Prognosis==
The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.<ref name=pmid10653284 />

==Epidemiology==
{{See also|Alzheimer's disease in African Americans|Alzheimer's Disease in the East Asian Population}}

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person-years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in populations is dependent upon factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, prevalence depends on the mean age of the population for which prevalence is given. In the United States in 2020, Alzheimer's dementia prevalence was estimated to be 5.3% for those in the 60–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 13.8% in the 74–84 group and to 34.6% in those greater than 85.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajan KB, Weuve J, Barnes LL, McAninch EA, Wilson RS, Evans DA |title=Population estimate of people with clinical Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment in the United States (2020-2060) |journal=Alzheimer's & Dementia |date=May 2021 |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1966–1975 |pmid=34043283 |doi=10.1002/alz.12362 |pmc=9013315 |s2cid=235215290 }}</ref> Prevalence rates in some less developed regions around the globe are lower.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rizzi L, Rosset I, Roriz-Cruz M |title=Global epidemiology of dementia: Alzheimer's and vascular types |journal=Biomed Res Int |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=908915 |date=2014 |pmid=25089278 |pmc=4095986 |doi=10.1155/2014/908915 |doi-access=free | title-link=doi }}</ref><ref name=pmid16360788>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ferri CP, Prince M, Brayne C, Brodaty H, Fratiglioni L, Ganguli M, Hall K, Hasegawa K, Hendrie H, Huang Y, Jorm A, Mathers C, Menezes PR, Rimmer E, Scazufca M|date=December 2005|title=Global prevalence of dementia: a Delphi consensus study|journal=Lancet|volume=366|issue=9503|pages=2112–2117|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67889-0|pmc=2850264|pmid=16360788}}</ref> As the incidence and prevalence are steadily increasing, the prevalence itself is projected to triple by 2050.{{clarify|date=December 2021}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li F, Qin W, Zhu M, Jia J | title = Model-Based Projection of Dementia Prevalence in China and Worldwide: 2020-2050 | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 82 | issue = 4 | pages = 1823–1831 | date = 1 January 2021 | pmid = 34219732 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-210493 | publisher = IOS Press | s2cid = 235735045 }}</ref> As of 2020, 50 million people globally have AD, with this number expected to increase to 152 million by 2050.<ref name=Breijyeh2020/>
