A '''dewclaw''' is a [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]] – [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] in some animals – on the [[foot]] of many [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[reptile]]s (including some extinct orders, like certain [[theropod]]s). It commonly grows higher on the leg than the rest of the foot, such that in [[digitigrade]] or [[unguligrade]] species, it does not make contact with the ground when the animal is standing. The name refers to the dewclaw's alleged tendency to brush [[dew]] away from grass.<ref name="Danziger/McCrum">Danziger, D., & McCrum, M. (2008). ''The Thingummy: A book about those everyday objects you just can't name''. London: Doubleday.</ref> On dogs and cats, the dewclaws are on the inside of the front legs, similarly to a human's [[thumb]], which shares evolutionary [[Homology (biology)|homology]].<ref name=Penn/>  Although many animals have dewclaws, other similar species do not, such as [[horse]]s, [[giraffe]]s, and the [[African wild dog]].

==Dogs==
[[Dog]]s almost always have dewclaws on the inside of the front legs and occasionally also on the hind legs.<ref name="Danziger/McCrum" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Dog Breeding|last=Rice|first=Dan|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7641-3887-4|edition=2|page=150}}<!--|access-date=2010-01-02--></ref> Unlike front dewclaws, rear dewclaws tend to have little bone or muscle structure in most breeds. It is normal, although not biologically necessary, that certain breeds will have more than one dewclaw on the same paw. One of these dewclaws will most likely be poorly connected to the leg, and is often surgically removed. When a dog has extra dewclaws in addition to the usual one on each front leg, the dog is said to be double dewclawed. For certain dog breeds, a dewclaw is considered a necessity, e.g., a [[Beauceron]] for [[Shepherd|sheep herding]] and for navigating snowy terrain.<ref name="Danziger/McCrum" /> As such, there is some debate about whether a dewclaw helps dogs gain traction when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and the [[toenail|nail]] on the dewclaw often wears down in the same way that the nails on their other toes do, from contact with the ground. In many dogs, the dewclaws never contact the ground. In this case, the dewclaw's nail never wears away, and it is often trimmed to maintain it at a safe length.

The dewclaws are not dead appendages. They can be used to lightly grip bones and other items that dogs hold with the paws. In some dogs, these claws may not appear to be connected to the leg at all except by a flap of skin; in such dogs, the claws do not have a use for gripping as the claw can easily fold or turn.<ref>{{cite book|title=Veterinary Pediatrics: Dogs and Cats from Birth to Six Months|last=Hoskins|first=Johnny D.|publisher=Saunders|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7216-7665-4|edition=3|page=251}}<!--|access-date=2010-01-02--></ref>

===Rear dewclaws===
[[Canid]]s have four claws on the rear feet,<ref>{{cite book|author=Macdonald, D.|year=1984|title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/56 56]|isbn=0-87196-871-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/56}}</ref> although some domestic dog breeds or individuals have an additional claw, or more rarely two, as is the case with the [[beauceron]]. A more technical term for these additional digits on the rear legs is ''hind-limb-specific preaxial [[polydactyly]]''.<ref name="park">{{Cite journal | pmc = 2516088 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.087114 |date=August 2008 |author1=Park, K. |author2=Kang, J. |author3=Subedi, K.

===Dewclaw removal===
There is some debate as to whether dewclaws should be surgically removed.<ref name="Danziger/McCrum" /><ref name=3ways>{{cite web|last1=Lotz|first1=Kristina N.|title=The Dewclaws Debate – Keep Them or Lose Them?|url=http://iheartdogs.com/the-dewclaws-debate-keep-them-or-lose-them/|website=iheartdogs.com|access-date=8 November 2015}}</ref> The argument for removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, and thus they can rip partway off or easily catch on something and break, which can be painful and prone to infection. Dewclaw removal is most easily performed when the dog is young, around 2–5 days of age. It can also be performed on older dogs if necessary though the surgery may be more difficult then.  The surgery is fairly straightforward and may be done with local anesthetics if the digit is not well connected to the leg.  Many dogs cannot resist licking the surgery site in the weeks following the procedure, so an [[Elizabethan collar]] or [[bitterant]] may be used to curtail this behavior, thus preventing infection.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

Some pups are commonly sold by breeders "dew-clawed", that is with the dewclaws removed (as by a [[veterinarian]]) for perceived health and safety reasons. A few breed standards, such as that for [[Portuguese Water Dog|Portuguese Water Dogs]], also call for it.

===Dewclaws and locomotion===
Based on stop-action photographs, veterinarian M. Christine Zink of Johns Hopkins University believes that the entire front foot, including the dewclaws, contacts the ground while running. During running, the dewclaw digs into the ground preventing twisting or torque on the rest of the leg. Several tendons connect the front dewclaw to muscles in the lower leg, further demonstrating the front dewclaws' functionality. There are indications that dogs without dewclaws have more foot injuries and are more prone to arthritis. Zink recommends "for working dogs it is best for the dewclaws not to be amputated. If the dewclaw does suffer a traumatic injury, the problem can be dealt with at that time, including amputation if needed."<ref name=Penn>{{cite web|last1=Zink|first1=M.

The dewclaw on cats is not vestigial. Wild [[Felidae|felids]] use the dewclaw in hunting, where it provides an additional claw with which to catch and hold prey.<ref name=lionalert/>

==Hoofed animals==
[[Image:Capreolus capreolus cloven hoof.jpg|thumb|right|Cloven hoofs of roe deer (''[[Capreolus capreolus]]''), with dewclaws]]
Hoofed animals walk on the tips of special toes, the [[hoof]]s. [[Cloven-hoof]]ed animals walk on a central pair of hoofs, but many also have an outer pair of dewclaws on each foot.  These are somewhat farther up the leg than the main hoofs, and similar in structure to them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Whitetail Hunting: Top-notch Strategies for Hunting North America's Most Popular Big-Game Animal|last1=Perich|first1=Shawn|last2=Furman|first2=Michael|publisher=Creative Publishing international|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58923-129-0|pages=8, 9}}<!--|access-date=2010-01-02--></ref>  In some species (such as [[cattle]]) the dewclaws are much smaller than the hoofs and never touch the ground. In others (such as [[pig]]s and many [[deer]]), they are only a little smaller than the hoofs, and may reach the ground in soft conditions or when jumping. Some hoofed animals (such as [[giraffe]]s and modern [[horse]]s) have no dewclaws. Video evidence suggests some animals use dewclaws in grooming or scratching themselves or to have better grasp during mating.{{CN|date=December 2018}}
