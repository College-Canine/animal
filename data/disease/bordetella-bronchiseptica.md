==Pathogenesis==
Humans are not natural carriers of ''B. bronchiseptica'', which typically infects the [[respiratory tract]]s of smaller mammals (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.).<ref name="Barron_1996" /> People are more likely to be infected by ''B. pertussis'' or ''[[Bordetella parapertussis|B. parapertussis]]''. Unlike ''B. pertussis'', ''B. bronchiseptica'' is generally resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics. It is also generally resistant to [[cephalosporin]]s. Some human cases have been successfully treated with [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] and [[fluoroquinolone]]s.

''B. bronchiseptica'' does not express [[pertussis toxin]], which is one of the characteristic virulence factors of ''B. pertussis'', but it has the genes to do so, highlighting the close evolutionary relationship between the two species.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Mattoo S, Foreman-Wykert AK, Cotter PA, Miller JF | title=Mechanisms of ''Bordetella'' pathogenesis | journal=Front Biosci | year=2001 | pages=E168–86 | volume=6 | pmid=11689354 | doi=10.2741/Mattoo| doi-access=free }}</ref><sup></sup><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Diavatopoulos DA, Cummings CA, Schouls LM, Brinig MM, Relman DA, Mooi FR | title=''Bordetella pertussis'', the Causative Agent of Whooping Cough, Evolved from a Distinct, Human-Associated Lineage of ''B. bronchiseptica'' | journal=PLOS Pathog | year=2005 | pages=e45 | volume=1 | issue=4 | pmid=16389302 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010045 | pmc=1323478 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Veterinary pathogenesis===
[[File:Bordetella bronchiseptica.jpg|thumb|A scanning electron micrograph depicted a number of Gram-negative ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'' bacteria]]
In veterinary medicine, ''B. bronchiseptica'' leads to a range of pathologies in different hosts. It is a serious disease of dogs, pigs, and rabbits, and has been seen in cats, horses, and seals. A PCR test for the pathogen exists.<ref name=Zoologix>{{cite web | title = Bordetella data sheet | publisher = Zoologix | url = http://www.zoologix.com/dogcat/Datasheets/Bordetella.htm | accessdate = 2009-03-08 }}</ref>

In [[pig]]s, ''B. bronchiseptica'' and ''[[Pasteurella multocida]]'' act synergistically to cause [[atrophic rhinitis]], a disease resulting in arrested growth and distortion of the [[turbinate]]s in the nasal terminus (snout).<ref>{{cite web | last = Lawhorn | first = Bruce | title = Atrophic Rhinitis | publisher = Texas Agricultural Extension Service | url = http://aglifesciences.tamu.edu/animalscience/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/04/L2193-atrophicrhinitis.pdf | id = L-2193 | accessdate = 2017-07-23 | archive-date = 2017-08-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170804061308/http://aglifesciences.tamu.edu/animalscience/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/04/L2193-atrophicrhinitis.pdf | url-status = dead }}</ref>
In [[dog]]s, ''B. bronchiseptica'' causes acute tracheobronchitis,<ref>Wagener, J. S., R. Sobonya, L. Minnich and L. M. Taussig (1984). Role of canine parainfluenza virus and ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'' in kennel cough. ''Am J Vet Res'' '''45'''(9): 1862-6.</ref> which typically has a harsh, honking cough. [[Kennel cough]] can also be caused by canine adenovirus-2 or canine parainfluenza virus or a combination of pathogens.<ref name="Zoologix" />

In [[rabbit]]s, ''B. bronchiseptica'' is often found in the nasal tract.  It is often assumed to cause a nearly [[asymptomatic]] infection known as [[Rhinitis|snuffles]], but the causative agent for that disease is ''[[Pasteurella multocida]]''; ''B. bronchiseptica'' often co-infects the nasal passage at the same time.<ref>Burns, E. H., Jr., J. M. Norman, M. D. Hatcher and D. A. Bemis (1993). Fimbriae and determination of host species specificity of ''Bordetella bronchiseptica''. ''J Clin Microbiol'' '''31'''(7): 1838-44</ref>

[[Cat]]s infected with ''B. bronchiseptica'' have been seen with tracheobronchitis, [[conjunctivitis]], and [[rhinitis]] (upper respiratory tract infection - URI), mandibular [[lymphadenopathy]], and [[pneumonia]]. However, URI in cats can also be caused by [[herpesvirus]], [[calicivirus]], ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' species, or ''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]''.<ref name="Zoologix" /> An intranasal vaccine exists for cats.<ref name=Intervet>{{cite web | title = Prevention and control of ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'' infection in cats | publisher = Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health | url = http://www.nobivacbb.com/bordetella/control/ | accessdate = 2009-03-08 }}</ref>

==Outbreaks==

===2022 outbreak===
In late 2022, together with the H3N2 strain of [[canine influenza]] and other respiratory pathogens, [[Bordetella|Bordetella bronchiseptica]] experienced a surge in canine infections. This was partially due to increased human travel and reopened offices following the relaxation of [[COVID-19 pandemic]] public health measures, leading to large numbers of dogs being placed together in kennels and doggy day care centers. Changing pet ownership behaviors also led to overcrowded animal shelters,after the pandemic.<ref name="2022 outbreak">{{cite news |last1=Anthes |first1=Emily |title=Dog Flu Is Back, Too |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/health/dogs-canine-flu.html |access-date=17 December 2022 |work=New York Times |date=2 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217151141/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/health/dogs-canine-flu.html |archive-date=17 December 2022}}</ref>
