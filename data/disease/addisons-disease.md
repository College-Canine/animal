=== Adrenal crisis ===
{{main|Adrenal crisis}}

An "adrenal crisis" or "addisonian crisis" is a constellation of symptoms that indicates severe adrenal insufficiency. This may be the result of either previously undiagnosed Addison's disease, a disease process suddenly affecting adrenal function (such as [[adrenal hemorrhage]]), or an intercurrent problem (e.g., infection, trauma) in someone known to have Addison's disease. It is a medical emergency and potentially life-threatening situation requiring immediate emergency treatment.<ref name="lecturio.com">{{cite web | url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/adrenal-insufficiency-and-addisons-disease/ | title= Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison's Disease

* [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]]
* [[Syncope (medicine)|Syncope]] (loss of consciousness and ability to stand)
* [[Hypoglycemia]] (reduced level of blood glucose)
* Confusion, [[psychosis]], slurred speech
* Severe [[lethargy]]

* [[Fever]]

== Causes ==
[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|200px|The negative feedback loop for glucocorticoids]]

Causes of adrenal insufficiency can be categorized by the mechanism through which they cause the adrenal glands to produce insufficient cortisol. This can be due to damage or destruction of the adrenal cortex. These deficiencies include glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones as well. These are adrenal dysgenesis (the gland has not formed adequately during development), impaired steroidogenesis (the gland is present but is biochemically unable to produce cortisol), or adrenal destruction (disease processes leading to glandular damage).<ref name=Ten/>

Darkening ([[hyperpigmentation]]) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun – characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases (e.g., of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC). After production in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH, and [[beta-lipotropin]]. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency, skin darkening does not occur, as ACTH is not overproduced.

===Adrenal destruction===
Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison's disease in the industrialized world as it represents between 68% and 94% of cases.<ref name="Adrenal Crisis as An Adverse Reacti"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bancos I, Hahner S, Tomlinson J, Arlt W | title = Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency | journal = The Lancet.

Adrenal destruction is also a feature of [[adrenoleukodystrophy]], and when the adrenal glands are involved in [[metastasis]] (seeding of [[cancer]] cells from elsewhere in the body, especially [[lung cancer|lung]]), [[hemorrhage]] (e.g., in [[Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]] or [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]), particular [[infection]]s ([[tuberculosis]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]]), or the deposition of abnormal protein in [[amyloidosis]].<ref name=medical-library.net>{{cite web | title = Addison's Disease | vauthors = Kennedy R | url = http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/570/41/ | publisher = The Doctors' Medical Library | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130412101933/http://www.medical-library.net/content/view/570/41/ | archive-date = 12 April 2013 | access-date = 10 April 2013 }}</ref>

===Adrenal dysgenesis===
All causes in this category are genetic, and generally very rare. These include [[genetic mutation|mutations]] to the ''[[Steroidogenic factor 1|SF1]]'' [[transcription factor]], [[X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita|congenital adrenal hypoplasia]] due to ''DAX-1'' gene mutations and mutations to the [[ACTH receptor]] gene (or related genes, such as in the [[Triple-A syndrome|Triple-A]] or Allgrove syndrome). ''DAX-1'' mutations may cluster in a syndrome with [[glycerol kinase]] deficiency with a number of other symptoms when ''DAX-1'' is deleted together with a number of other genes.<ref name=Ten/>

===Impaired steroidogenesis===
To form cortisol, the adrenal gland requires [[cholesterol]], which is then converted biochemically into steroid hormones. Interruptions in the delivery of cholesterol include [[Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome]] and [[abetalipoproteinemia]].{{verify source|date=August 2020}}Of the synthesis problems, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] is the most common (in various forms: [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21-hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17α-hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11β-hydroxylase]] and [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency|3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]]), [[Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia|lipoid CAH]] due to deficiency of [[steroidogenic acute regulatory protein|StAR]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] mutations.<ref name=Ten/> Some medications interfere with steroid synthesis enzymes (e.g., [[ketoconazole]]), while others accelerate the normal breakdown of hormones by the [[liver]] (e.g., [[rifampicin]], [[phenytoin]]).<ref name=Ten/>

== Diagnosis ==

=== Suggestive features ===
Routine laboratory investigations may show:<ref name=Ten/>
* [[Low blood sugar]] (worse in children due to loss of glucocorticoid's glucogenic effects)
* [[Hyponatremia|Low blood sodium]], due to loss of production of the hormone [[aldosterone]], to the kidney's inability to excrete [[free water]] in the absence of sufficient cortisol, and also the effect of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] to stimulate secretion of [[Vasopressin|ADH]].
* [[Hyperkalemia|High blood potassium]], due to loss of production of the hormone [[aldosterone]].
* [[Eosinophilia]] and [[lymphocytosis]] (increased number of [[eosinophil]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s, two types of [[white blood cell]]s)
* [[Metabolic acidosis]] (increased blood acidity), also is due to loss of the hormone [[aldosterone]] because sodium reabsorption in the [[distal tubule]] is linked with acid/hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) secretion. Absent or insufficient levels of aldosterone stimulation of the renal distal tubule lead to sodium wasting in the urine and H<sup>+</sup> retention in the serum.

===Testing===

[[Image:Cortisol2.svg|thumb|[[Cortisol]]]]

[[Image:Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|[[Aldosterone]]]]

In suspected cases of Addison's disease, demonstration of low adrenal hormone levels even after appropriate stimulation (called the [[ACTH stimulation test|ACTH stimulation test or synacthen test]]) with synthetic pituitary ACTH hormone [[tetracosactide]] is needed for the diagnosis. Two tests are performed, the short and the long test. Dexamethasone does not cross-react with the assay and can be administered concomitantly during testing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorin RI, Qualls CR, Crapo LM | title = Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages = 194–204 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12899587 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-139-3-200308050-00017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Holt EH | title=ACTH (cosyntropin) stimulation test |year=2008|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003696.htm | work = MedLine Plus | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref>

The short test compares blood cortisol levels before and after 250 micrograms of tetracosactide (intramuscular or intravenous) is given. If one hour later, [[Blood plasma|plasma]] cortisol exceeds 170 nmol/L and has risen by at least 330 nmol/L to at least 690 nmol/L, adrenal failure is excluded. If the short test is abnormal, the long test is used to differentiate between primary adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2021-07-14 |title=Addison's Disease |url=https://wasiclinic.com/en/addisons-disease/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=wasiclinic |language=en-US }}{{Dead link|date=January 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The long test uses 1&nbsp;mg tetracosactide (intramuscular). Blood is taken 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours later.  Normal plasma cortisol level should reach 1,000 nmol/L by 4 hours. In primary Addison's disease, the cortisol level is reduced at all stages, whereas in secondary corticoadrenal insufficiency, a delayed but normal response is seen. Other tests may be performed to distinguish between various causes of hypoadrenalism, including [[renin]] and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] levels, as well as [[medical imaging]] – usually in the form of [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].<ref name=":2" />

[[Adrenoleukodystrophy]], and the milder form, [[adrenomyeloneuropathy]], cause adrenal insufficiency combined with neurological symptoms. These diseases are estimated to be the cause of adrenal insufficiency in about 35% of diagnosed males with idiopathic Addison's disease and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any male with adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis is made by a blood test to detect [[Very long chain fatty acid|very long-chain fatty acids]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laureti S, Casucci G, Santeusanio F, Angeletti G, Aubourg P, Brunetti P | title = X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a frequent cause of idiopathic Addison's disease in young adult male patients | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 470–474 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8636252 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.81.2.8636252 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Treatment ==

=== Maintenance ===
Treatment for Addison's disease involves replacing the missing cortisol, sometimes in the form of [[hydrocortisone]] tablets, or [[prednisone]] tablets in a dosing regimen that mimics the physiological concentrations of cortisol. Alternatively, one-quarter as much [[prednisolone]] may be used for [[Glucocorticoid#Pharmacologic properties|equal glucocorticoid effect]] as hydrocortisone. Treatment is usually lifelong. In addition, many people require [[fludrocortisone]] as a replacement for the missing aldosterone.<ref name="lecturio.com"/>

People with Addison's are often advised to carry information on them (e.g., in the form of a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet or information card) for the attention of [[emergency medical services]] personnel who might need to attend to their needs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Quinkler M, Dahlqvist P, Husebye ES, Kämpe O | title = A European Emergency Card for adrenal insufficiency can save lives | journal = European Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–76 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25498511 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejim.2014.11.006 }}</ref><ref name=Michels2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michels A, Michels N | title = Addison disease: early detection and treatment principles | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 89 | issue = 7 | pages = 563–568 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24695602 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0401/p563.html | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905194421/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0401/p563.html | archive-date = 5 September 2015 }}</ref> A needle, syringe, and injectable form of cortisol are also recommended to be carried for emergencies.<ref name=Michels2014/> People with Addison's disease are advised to increase their medication during periods of illness or when undergoing surgery or dental treatment.<ref name=Michels2014/> Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occur, as these conditions can precipitate an Addisonian crisis.

Those with low aldosterone levels may also benefit from a high-sodium diet. It may also be beneficial for the people with Addison's disease to increase their dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D. High dosages of corticosteroids are linked to osteoporosis so these may be necessary for bone health.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eating, Diet, and Nutrition for Adrenal Insufficiency & Addison's Disease {{!}} NIDDK|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/eating-diet-nutrition|access-date=2020-12-03|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|language=en-US}}</ref> Sources of calcium include dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified flours among many others.

===Crisis===
Standard therapy involves intravenous injections of glucocorticoids and large volumes of intravenous saline solution with dextrose ([[glucose]]). This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. If intravenous access is not immediately available, intramuscular injection of glucocorticoids can be used. When the person is capable of swallowing fluids and medications by mouth, the amount of glucocorticoids is decreased until a maintenance dose is reached. If aldosterone is deficient, maintenance therapy also includes oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm | title = Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison's Disease | publisher = National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service | access-date = 26 November 2010 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110426030100/http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm | archive-date = 26 April 2011 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Outcomes are typically good when treated. Most people can expect to live relatively normal lives. Someone with the disease should be observant of symptoms of an "Addison's crisis" while the body is strained, as in rigorous exercise or being sick, the latter often needing emergency treatment with intravenous injections to treat the crisis.<ref name=NHS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Addisons-disease/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=Addison's disease – Treatment|publisher=NHS Choices|access-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009184815/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Addisons-disease/Pages/Treatment.aspx|archive-date=9 October 2016}}</ref>

==History==
Addison's disease is named after [[Thomas Addison]], the British [[physician]] who first described the condition in ''On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules'' (1855).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Addison T | author-link = Thomas Addison | title = On The Constitutional And Local Effects Of Disease Of The Supra-Renal Capsules | url = http://www.wehner.org/addison/x1.htm | publisher = Samuel Highley | location = London | year = 1855 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050414034113/http://www.wehner.org/addison/x1.htm | archive-date = 14 April 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bancos |first1=Irina |last2=Hahner |first2=Stefanie |last3=Tomlinson |first3=Jeremy |last4=Arlt |first4=Wiebke |date=2014-08-03 |title=Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70142-1 |journal=The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=216–226 |doi=10.1016/s2213-8587(14)70142-1 |pmid=25098712 |issn=2213-8587}}</ref> He originally described it as "melasma suprarenale", but later physicians gave it the [[Medical eponyms|medical eponym]] "Addison's disease" in recognition of Addison's discovery.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FYCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281|title=Physician and Surgeon|date=1885|publisher=Keating & Bryant}}</ref>

While the six under Addison in 1855 all had adrenal tuberculosis,<ref name="pmid18591375">{{cite journal | vauthors = Patnaik MM, Deshpande AK | title = Diagnosis--Addison's disease secondary to tuberculosis of the adrenal glands | journal = Clinical Medicine & Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 29 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18591375 | pmc = 2442022 | doi = 10.3121/cmr.2007.754a }}</ref> the term "Addison's disease" does not imply an underlying disease process.

The condition was initially considered a form of [[anemia]] associated with the adrenal glands. Because little was known at the time about the adrenal glands (then called "Supra-Renal Capsules"), Addison's monograph describing the condition was an isolated insight. As the adrenal function became better known, Addison's monograph became known as an important medical contribution and a classic example of careful medical observation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop PM | title = The history of the discovery of Addison's disease | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–42 | date = January 1950 | pmid = 15409948 | pmc = 2081266 | doi = 10.1177/003591575004300105 }}</ref> [[Tuberculosis]] used to be a major cause of Addison's disease and acute adrenal failure worldwide. It remains a leading cause in [[developing countries]] today.<ref name=":1" />

[[US president]] [[John F. Kennedy]] (1917–1963) suffered from complications of Addison's disease throughout his life, including during his presidency, resulting in [[fatigue]] and hyperpigmentation of the face.
