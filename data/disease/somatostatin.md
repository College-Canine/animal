'''Somatostatin''', also known as  '''growth hormone-inhibiting hormone''' ('''GHIH''') or by [[#Nomenclature|several other names]], is a [[peptide hormone]] that regulates the [[endocrine system]] and affects [[neurotransmission]] and [[cell proliferation]] via interaction with [[G protein-coupled]] [[somatostatin receptors]] and inhibition of the release of numerous secondary hormones. Somatostatin inhibits insulin and glucagon secretion.<ref>"somatostatin". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016.

==Production==

===Digestive system===

Somatostatin is secreted by [[delta cells]] at several locations in the digestive system, namely the [[pyloric antrum]], the [[duodenum]] and the [[pancreatic islets]].<ref name="isbn9781437717532">{{cite book | last1 = Boron | first1 = Walter F. | last2 = Boulpaep | first2 = Emile L. | name-list-style = vanc | title = Medical Physiology | publisher = Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781437717532 }}</ref>

Somatostatin released in the [[pyloric antrum]] travels via the portal venous system to the heart, then enters the systemic circulation to reach the locations where it will exert its inhibitory effects. In addition, somatostatin release from delta cells can act in a [[paracrine]] manner.<ref name="isbn9781437717532"/>

In the stomach, somatostatin acts directly on the acid-producing [[parietal cells]] via a G-protein coupled receptor (which inhibits adenylate cyclase, thus effectively antagonising the stimulatory effect of histamine) to reduce acid secretion.<ref name="isbn9781437717532"/> Somatostatin can also indirectly decrease stomach acid production by preventing the release of other hormones, including [[gastrin]] and [[histamine]] which effectively slows down the digestive process.{{cn|date=May 2022}}

===Brain===
{|Somatostatin is also produced in the hypothalamus; it will inhibit GH and TSH.

Somatostatin is produced by [[neuroendocrine]] neurons of the [[ventromedial nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]]. These neurons project to the [[median eminence]], where somatostatin is released from neurosecretory nerve endings into the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamohypophysial system]] through neuron axons. Somatostatin is then carried to the [[anterior pituitary gland]], where it inhibits the secretion of [[growth hormone]] from [[somatotrope]] cells. The somatostatin neurons in the periventricular nucleus mediate negative feedback effects of [[growth hormone]] on its own release; the somatostatin neurons respond to high circulating concentrations of growth hormone and somatomedins by increasing the release of somatostatin, so reducing the rate of secretion of growth hormone.{{cn|date=May 2022}}

Somatostatin is also produced by several other populations that project centrally, i.e., to other areas of the brain, and somatostatin receptors are expressed at many different sites in the brain. In particular, populations of somatostatin neurons occur in the [[arcuate nucleus]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Minami |first1=Shiro |last2=Kamegai |first2=Jun |last3=Sugihara |first3=Hitoshi |last4=Suzuki |first4=Nobuchika |last5=Wakabayashi |first5=Ichiji |title=Growth Hormone Inhibits Its Own Secretion by Acting on the Hypothalamus through Its Receptors on Neuropeptide Y Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus and Somatostatin Neurons in the Periventricular Nucleus |journal=Endocrine Journal |date=1998 |volume=45 |pages=S19-26 |doi=10.1507/endocrj.45.Suppl_S19 |pmid=9790225 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/endocrj1993/45/Suppl/45_Suppl_S19/_pdf |access-date=10 January 2021|doi-access=free }}</ref> the [[hippocampus]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stefanelli |first1=Thomas |last2=Bertollini |first2=Cristina |last3=Lüscher |first3=Christian |last4=Muller |first4=Dominique |last5=Mendez |first5=Pablo |title=Hippocampal Somatostatin Interneurons Control the Size of Neuronal Memory Ensembles |journal=Neuron |date=February 2016 |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=1074–1085 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.024 |pmid=26875623 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and the brainstem [[nucleus of the solitary tract]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[Octreotide]] (brand name Sandostatin, [[Novartis|Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]) is an [[peptide|octapeptide]] that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though is a more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than the natural hormone, and has a much longer [[half-life]] (about 90 minutes, compared to 2–3 minutes for somatostatin). Since it is absorbed poorly from the gut, it is administered parenterally (subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously). It is indicated for [[symptomatic treatment]] of  [[carcinoid syndrome]] and [[acromegaly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/carcinoid-tumors-and-syndrome/ | title= Carcinoid Tumors and Syndrome | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 5 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Acromegaly|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/acromegaly/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx|website=NIDDK|access-date=5 July 2021|date=April 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827213949/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/acromegaly/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx|archive-date=27 August 2016}}</ref> It is also finding increased use in polycystic diseases of the liver and kidney.

[[Lanreotide]] (Somatuline, [[Ipsen|Ipsen Pharmaceuticals]]) is a medication used in the management of acromegaly and symptoms caused by neuroendocrine tumors, most notably carcinoid syndrome. It is a long-acting [[structural analog|analog]] of somatostatin, like octreotide. It is available in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, and was approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration on August 30, 2007.

[[Pasireotide]], sold under the brand name Signifor, is an [[orphan drug]] approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of [[Cushing's disease]] in patients who fail or are ineligible for surgical therapy. It was developed by [[Novartis]]. Pasireotide is somatostatin [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] with a 40-fold increased affinity to [[somatostatin receptor 5]] compared to other somatostatin analogs.

==Evolutionary history==
Six somatostatin genes have been discovered in [[vertebrates]]. The current proposed history as to how these six genes arose is based on the three whole-genome duplication events that took place in vertebrate evolution along with local duplications in [[teleost]] fish. An ancestral somatostatin gene was duplicated during the first [[whole-genome duplication event]] (1R) to create ''SS1'' and ''SS2''. These two genes were duplicated during the second whole-genome duplication event (2R) to create four new somatostatin genes:''SS1, SS2, SS3'', and one gene that was lost during the evolution of vertebrates. [[Tetrapods]] retained ''SS1'' (also known as ''SS-14'' and ''SS-28'') and ''SS2'' (also known as [[Cortistatin (neuropeptide)|cortistatin]]) after the split in the [[Sarcopterygii]] and [[Actinopterygii]] lineage split. In [[teleost]] fish, ''SS1, SS2'', and ''SS3'' were duplicated during the third whole-genome duplication event (3R) to create ''SS1, SS2, SS4, SS5,'' and two genes that were lost during the evolution of teleost fish. ''SS1'' and ''SS2'' went through local duplications to give rise to ''SS6'' and ''SS3''.<ref name="Liu"/>
