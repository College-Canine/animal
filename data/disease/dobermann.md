The '''Dobermann'''{{efn|name= a}} is a German [[list of dog breeds|breed]] of medium-large domestic [[dog]] of [[pinscher]] type. It was originally bred in [[Thuringia]] in about 1890 by [[Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann|Louis Dobermann]], a tax collector.<ref name="Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/doberman_pinscher/index.cfm "Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209073438/http://www.akc.org/breeds/doberman_pinscher/index.cfm |date=9 February 2015 }}, 'The American Kennel Club', retrieved 6 May 2014</ref> It has a long muzzle and – ideally – an even and graceful [[gait]]. The ears were traditionally [[Cropping (animal)|cropped]] and the tail [[docking (dog)|docked]], practices which are now illegal in many countries.

The Dobermann is intelligent, alert and tenaciously loyal; it is kept as a [[guard dog]] or as a [[companion animal]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/opinion/l-dobermans-suffer-from-a-bad-press-003793.html|title=Dobermans Suffer From a Bad Press|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 February 1993 |access-date=20 August 2018|archive-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820172817/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/opinion/l-dobermans-suffer-from-a-bad-press-003793.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In Canada and the United States it is known as the '''Doberman Pinscher'''.

== History ==

[[File:Doberman Pinscher Portrait.jpg|thumb|Dobermann, 1909]]
Dobermanns were first bred in the 1880s by [[Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann]], a tax collector who ran a dog pound in [[Apolda]], in [[Thuringia]] in central Germany. With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after Dobermann's death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Doberman Pinschers| url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780866228060| url-access= registration| last= Donnelly| first= Kerry| publisher= T.F.H.

[[File:Dobermann Pinscher from 1915.JPG|thumb|right|Dobermann Pinscher, 1915]]

The breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the [[Beauceron]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Rottweiler]] and [[Weimaraner]].<ref name="Breeds">{{cite web |url= http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |title= Breed history |publisher= Dobermann Pinscher Club of America |access-date= 24 August 2016 |archive-date= 18 February 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160218235554/http://www.dpca.org/breed/breed_history.htm |url-status= live }}</ref> The single exception is the documented crossing with the [[Greyhound]] and [[Manchester Terrier]]. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's ''The Dobermann Pinscher'' (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The [[American Kennel Club]] believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.<ref name="Get to Know the Doberman Pinscher"/>

After Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an "n" from Dobermann's surname.<ref name="Breeds" />

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official [[war dog]], although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

In 2013 a list of breeds by annual number of registrations, based on a survey of member clubs of the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]], placed the Dobermann 26th, with {{val|20941}} new registrations per year.{{r|skk}} Statistics compiled by the AKC for 2009 placed the Doberman Pinscher 15th, with {{val|10,233}} registrations in that year.{{r|akcstat}}

The standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility.<ref name="ukc"/> The ideal weight of male dogs is described as {{convert|40|-|45|kg|lb}}<ref name=FCI/> and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be {{convert|32|-|35|kg|lb}}.<ref name=FCI/>

Two different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for ''black'' (B) and one for ''color dilution'' (D). There are nine possible combinations of these [[allele]]s, which can result in four different color [[phenotypes]]: black, blue, red, and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]] (Isabella).<ref name="DPCA-color">{{cite web

The ''red'', ''red rust,'' or ''brown'' coloration occurs when the black gene has two [[Recessive gene|recessive]] alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The ''blue'' Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The ''fawn'' coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

Expression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called [[Canine follicular dysplasia|color dilution alopecia]], a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.<ref name="dilution">{{cite journal

This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to "fix" the mutation. This severe inbreeding not only intensified the production of "white" dogs, it also amplified their health problems. White Dobermans are not recognized within professional breeders and continue to be reproduced by unethical breeders marketing them as rare in order to charge more for an animal that would never win a show competition. The white colored Doberman is prone to suffer long term medical conditions ranging from: poor hearing or complete deafness, poor vision or complete blindness, behavioral/temperament issues, cancers (predominately skin cancer), amongst others. White/Albino Dobermanns are actually a cream color with white markings, blue eyes, and pink nose. Although this is consistent with [[albinism]], the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown. The animals are commonly known as [[tyrosinase]]-positive albinoids, lacking [[melanin]] in oculocutaneous structures.<ref name="doberinfo">{{cite web

== Intelligence ==

[[Dog intelligence|Canine intelligence]] is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties involved in a wide range of mental tasks, such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. The Doberman Pinscher has been ranked amongst the most intelligent dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations. Psychologist [[Stanley Coren]] ranks the Dobermann as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of ''[[Obedience training|obedience command training]],'' based on the selective surveys answered by experienced trainers (as documented in his book ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''). Additionally, in two studies, Hart and Hart (1985) ranked the Doberman Pinscher first in the same category,<ref name="hart">

Although they are considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1958/05/12/577801/the-doberman-pinscher-darlingor-devil|title=The Doberman pinscher: darling...or devil?|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171358/https://www.si.com/vault/1958/05/12/577801/the-doberman-pinscher-darlingor-devil|url-status=live}}</ref>

There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined.<ref name="scott">{{cite book

These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions.

In addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs, and rivalry with other household dogs.<ref name="duffy2008">{{cite journal|

The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., [[Cocker Spaniel]], [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], and [[Great Dane]]). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall.<ref name="duffy2008"/>

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as [[Pit bull]]s, [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]], [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Husky]]-type dogs, [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s and [[Alaskan Malamute]]s.<ref name="CDC">[https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623055336/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/dogbreeds.pdf |date=23 June 2011 }}.
