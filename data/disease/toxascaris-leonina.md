'''''Toxascaris leonina''''' is a common [[parasite|parasitic]] [[roundworm]] found in dogs, cats, [[fox]]es, and related host species. ''T. leonina'' is an [[Ascarididae|ascarid]] [[Nematoda|nematode]], a worldwide distributed [[helminth]] parasite which is in a division of [[eukaryotic]] parasites that, unlike external parasites such as [[lice]] and [[fleas]], live inside their host.<ref name="maizels">{{cite journal|author=Maizels RM, [[Maria Yazdanbakhsh|Yazdanbakhsh M]] |title=Immune regulation by helminth parasites: cellular and molecular mechanisms |journal=Nat.

Infection occurs in the definitive host when the animal eats an infected rodent. While ''T. leonina'' can occur in either dogs or cats, it is far more frequent in cats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vetpetstop.co.uk/pets/worming/roundworm.php |title=Roundworms in pets, Vet PetStop, UK |access-date=2009-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082705/http://www.vetpetstop.co.uk/pets/worming/roundworm.php |archive-date=2009-05-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A [[coprolite]] containing ''T. leonina'' eggs was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in Argentina's [[Catamarca Province]] and dated to 17002–16573 years old. This finding indicates that ''T. leonina'' has existed in South America since at least the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Petrigh, R. S. |author2=Martínez, J.

==Life cycle==
The life cycle of ''T. leonina'' is fairly simple. [[Egg (biology)|Eggs]] are ingested and hatch in the small intestine. The juveniles then penetrate the mucosal lining of the small intestine. After growth and molt, they return to the intestinal lumen and mature. The adult female worm lays eggs which are passed in the feces of the animal. The eggs become infective after 3–6 days in the environment.

Cats can become infected by ingesting either the egg or rodents that contain the larvae. Rodents are usually the intermediate hosts of ''T. leonina''. The rodent ingests the eggs and, once the eggs are hatched, the larvae migrate through the tissues of the rodent. The definitive host is then infected with this parasite when it eats an infected rodent.

The egg of the ''T. leonina'' is usually more oval than round. The prepatent period for ''T. leonina'' is two to three months.  The adult worms are usually 3-4&nbsp;inches long and can be seen in the feces and vomit of the animal.

''Toxascaris leonina'' differs from other [[Toxocara]] in that the larvae do not migrate through the lungs; but rather, the entire developmental cycle occurs in the gut.<ref name=Mondo>{{cite web |title=Mondofacto Medical Dictionary, Definition of ''Toxacaris leonina'' |url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Toxascaris+leonina |access-date=2009-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208014731/http://mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Toxascaris+leonina |archive-date=2010-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Symptoms of infection==
Roundworms absorb the nutrients from the animal, which can interfere with digestion and can also damage the lining of the intestine. Animals may not show any outward symptoms of roundworms at all, or in other, usually more severe cases, animals may have diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, experience thinning, dull coats, and in puppies or kittens, can develop distended abdomens, or "pot-belly" appearance.

Infection symptoms are similar to infection by other ''Toxacara'' species (''[[Toxocara canis|T. canis]]'', ''[[Toxocara cati|T. cati]]''). It is a common cause of diarrhea in young animals and can cause vomiting as well. Sometimes the worms themselves are vomited up, which can be alarming as they can be quite large with females reaching lengths of up to seven inches. The worms consume the host's food and can lead to lethargy and a classical pot-bellied appearance. Unlike T. canis and T. Cati, T. leonina is nonmigratory with its life cycle affecting only one organ.<ref name=VetPartners>{{cite journal |url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=476 |title=Roundworms in Dogs and Puppies|website=Vin.com|date=2020-08-31|orig-year=2001-03-12|last=Brooks|first=Wendy}}</ref>

==Prevention and treatment==
It is recommended to de-worm all puppies and kittens at 6 weeks and repeat treatment 2–4 weeks after the first treatment. ''T. leonina'' roundworm infections are treated with the same medication protocol as the ''T. canis'' or ''T. cati'' roundworm infections (see [[Toxocariasis]]). Therefore, when eggs are seen on a [[fecal flotation]] exam, or fecal swab, it is not necessary to determine which species is present. Roundworm infections are treated with medication, called "de-wormers", and includes such drugs as [[fenbendazole]], [[pyrantel]], [[milbemycin oxime]], and [[piperazine]].

To prevent reinfection of parasitic roundworms, it is recommended that anything that the animal has been in contact with should be cleaned thoroughly or replaced, including bedding and kennels. It is also strongly recommended that outside areas where defecation may occur be cleaned, as well as all feces removed daily from outdoor pet runs, crates, and the yard.

==Risk to humans==
Humans are usually not infected with ''T. leonina''; however, this parasite has been found in humans in a few instances and is a cause of visceral larva migrans in children, though less frequently implicated than is ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', the most common roundworm parasite found in dogs.<ref name="Mondo"/>
