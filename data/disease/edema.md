<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Edema''', also spelled '''oedema''', and also known as '''fluid retention''', '''dropsy''', '''hydropsy''' and '''swelling''', is the build-up of fluid in the body's [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].<ref name= IQ2016>{{cite book |title=Causes and signs of edema |date=2016 |publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279409/}}</ref> Most commonly, the legs or arms are affected.<ref name=IQ2016/> Symptoms may include skin which feels tight, the area may feel heavy, and joint stiffness.<ref name=IQ2016/> Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause.<ref name= Mer2019 />

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}

===Specific area===
An edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammations, [[Tendonopathy|tendinitis]] or [[pancreatitis]], for instance. Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms. Examples of edema in specific organs:
* [[Peripheral edema]] (“dependent” edema of legs) is extracellular fluid accumulation in the lower extremities caused by the effects of gravity, and occurs when fluid pools in the lower parts of the body, including the feet, legs, or hands.  This often occurs in immobile patients, such as paraplegics or quadriplegics, pregnant women, or in otherwise healthy people due to [[hypervolemia]] or maintaining a standing or seated posture for an extended period of time. It can occur due to diminished venous return of blood to the heart due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. It can also occur in patients with increased hydrostatic venous pressure or decreased oncotic venous pressure, due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous vessels draining the lower extremity. Certain drugs (for example, amlodipine) can cause pedal edema.
* [[Cerebral edema]] is extracellular fluid accumulation in the brain.<ref name="IQ2016" /> It can occur in toxic or abnormal metabolic states and conditions such as systemic lupus or reduced oxygen at high altitudes. It causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness, leading to [[brain herniation]] and death.
* [[Pulmonary edema]] occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in the lung is raised because of obstruction to the removal of blood via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals. Pulmonary edema produces shortness of breath. [[Pleural effusion]]s may occur when fluid also accumulates in the [[pleural]] cavity.
* Edema may also be found in the cornea of the eye with [[glaucoma]], severe [[conjunctivitis]], [[keratitis]], or after surgery. Affected people may perceive coloured haloes around bright lights.
* Edema surrounding the eyes is called [[periorbital edema]] (puffy eyes) . The periorbital tissues are most noticeably swollen immediately after waking, perhaps as a result of the gravitational redistribution of fluid in the horizontal position.
* Common appearances of [[cutaneous]] edema are observed with [[mosquito]] bites, [[spider]] bites, bee stings ([[wheal and flare]]), and skin contact with certain plants such as [[poison ivy]] or [[western poison oak]],<ref>{{cite web |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |year=2008 |url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |title=Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |archive-date=July 21, 2009  |website=GlobalTwitcher |editor-first=Nicklas |editor-last=Strömberg}}</ref> the latter of which are termed ''[[contact dermatitis]]''.
* Another cutaneous form of edema is [[myxedema]], which is caused by increased deposition of [[connective tissue]]. In myxedema (and a variety of other rarer conditions) edema is caused by an increased tendency of the tissue to hold water within its extracellular space. In myxedema, this is due to  an increase in hydrophilic carbohydrate-rich molecules (perhaps mostly [[hyaluronin]]) deposited in the tissue matrix. Edema forms more easily in dependent areas in the elderly (sitting in chairs at home or on aeroplanes) and this is not well understood. Estrogens alter body weight in part through changes in tissue water content. There may be a variety of poorly understood situations in which transfer of water from tissue matrix to lymphatics is impaired because of changes in the hydrophilicity of the tissue or failure of the 'wicking' function of terminal lymphatic capillaries.
* Myoedema is localized mounding of muscle tissue due to percussive pressure, such as flicking the relaxed muscle with the forefinger and thumb. It produces a mound, visible, firm and non-tender at the point of tactile stimulus approximately 1-2 seconds after stimulus, subsiding back to normal after 5-10 seconds. It is a sign in hypothyroid myopathy, such as [[Hoffmann syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Vignesh |first1=G |last2=Balachandran |first2=Karthik |last3=Kamalanathan |first3=Sadishkumar |last4=Hamide |first4=Abdoul |date=2013 |title=Myoedema: A clinical pointer to hypothyroid myopathy |journal=Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=352 |doi=10.4103/2230-8210.109672 |issn=2230-8210 |pmc=3683223 |pmid=23776921 |doi-access=free }}</ref> 
* In [[lymphedema]], abnormal removal of interstitial fluid is caused by failure of the [[lymphatic system]]. This may be due to obstruction from, for example, pressure from a [[cancer]] or enlarged [[lymph nodes]], destruction of lymph vessels by [[radiotherapy]], or infiltration of the lymphatics by infection (such as [[Podoconiosis|elephantiasis]]). It is most commonly due to a failure of the pumping action of muscles due to immobility, most strikingly in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, or paraplegia. It has been suggested that the edema that occurs in some people following use of aspirin-like cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen or indomethacin may be due to inhibition of lymph heart action.

=== Generalized ===
A rise in [[hydrostatic pressure]] occurs in cardiac failure. A fall in osmotic pressure occurs in [[nephrotic syndrome]] and [[liver failure]].<ref name="pmid8790586">{{cite journal |last= Renkin |first=EM | title = Cellular aspects of transvascular exchange: a 40-year perspective | journal = Microcirculation | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–67 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8790586 | doi = 10.3109/10739689409148270 | s2cid = 28046134 }}</ref>

Causes of edema which are generalized to the whole body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause [[pulmonary edema]], pleural effusions, [[ascites]] and [[peripheral edema]]. Such severe systemic edema is called [[anasarca]]. In rare cases, a [[parvovirus B19]] infection may cause generalized edemas.<ref name="pmid23472922">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wiggli B, Imhof E, Meier CA, Laifer G | title = Water, water, everywhere. Acute parvovirus B19 infection | journal = Lancet | volume = 381 | issue = 9868 | pages = 776 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23472922 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61894-7 | s2cid = 19300719 }}</ref>

Although a low plasma [[oncotic pressure]] is widely cited for the edema of nephrotic syndrome, most physicians note that the edema may occur before there is any significant protein in the urine ([[proteinuria]]) or fall in plasma protein level. Most forms of nephrotic syndrome are due to biochemical and structural changes in the basement membrane of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli, and these changes occur, if to a lesser degree, in the vessels of most other tissues of the body. Thus the resulting increase in permeability that leads to protein in the urine can explain the edema if all other vessels are more permeable as well.<ref name="pmid9185099">{{cite journal |vauthors=Palmer BF, Alpern RJ | title = Pathogenesis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome | journal = Kidney Int. Suppl. | volume = 59 | pages = S21–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9185099 }}</ref>

As well as the previously mentioned conditions, edemas often occur during the late stages of pregnancy in some women. This is more common with those of a history of pulmonary problems or poor circulation also being intensified if arthritis is already present in that particular woman. Women who already have arthritic problems most often have to seek medical help for pain caused from over-reactive swelling. Edemas that occur during pregnancy are usually found in the lower part of the leg, usually from the calf down.

[[Hydrops fetalis]] is a condition in a baby characterized by an accumulation of fluid in at least two body compartments.

==Cause==
=== Heart ===
The pumping force of the [[human heart|heart]] should help to keep a normal pressure within the [[blood vessel]]s. But if the heart begins to fail (a condition known as [[congestive heart failure]]) the pressure changes can cause very severe water retention. In this condition water retention is mostly visible in the [[human leg|leg]]s, feet and [[ankle]]s, but water also collects in the [[lungs]], where it causes a chronic [[cough]]. This condition is usually treated with [[diuretics]]; otherwise, the water retention may cause breathing problems and additional stress on the heart.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Casu|first1=Gavino|last2=Merella|first2=Pierluigi|date=July 2015|title=Diuretic Therapy in Heart Failure – Current Approaches|journal=European Cardiology Review|volume=10|issue=1|pages=42–47|doi=10.15420/ecr.2015.10.01.42|issn=1758-3756|pmc=6159465|pmid=30310422}}</ref>

=== Kidneys ===
Another cause of severe water retention is [[kidney failure]], where the [[kidneys]] are no longer able to filter fluid out of the [[blood]] and turn it into [[urine]]. [[Kidney disease]] often starts with [[inflammation]], for instance in the case of diseases such as [[nephrotic syndrome]] or [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]]. This type of water retention is usually visible in the form of swollen [[human leg|leg]]s and [[ankle]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edema - Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20366493 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=Mayo Clinic |language=en}}</ref>

=== Liver ===
[[Cirrhosis]] (scarring) of the liver is a common cause of edema in the legs and abdominal cavity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edema - Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20366493 |access-date=2022-12-23 |website=Mayo Clinic |language=en}}</ref>

=== Veins ===
Phlebetic lymphedema (or phlebolymphedema) is seen in untreated [[chronic venous insufficiency]] and is the most common type of edema (approx. 90%).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last1=Publishing |first1=Licorn |last2=Guiboles |date=2009-11-24 |title=The causes of edema in chronic venous insufficiency |url=https://www.phlebolymphology.org/the-causes-of-edema-in-chronic-venous/ |access-date=2023-09-01 |website=Servier - Phlebolymphology |language=en-US}}</ref> It is a combination venous/lymphatic disorder that originates in defective "leaky" veins that allows the blood to back flow ([[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous reflux]]), slowing the return of the blood to the heart ([[venous stasis]]). The venous pressure in the legs changes dramatically while standing compared to lying down. How much pressure there is depends on the person's height, in the average adult person, it is 8 mm Hg while lying down and 100 mm Hg while standing.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Farrow |first=Wade |date=2010 |title=Phlebolymphedema-a common underdiagnosed and undertreated problem in the wound care clinic |journal=The Journal of the American College of Certified Wound Specialists |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14–23 |doi=10.1016/j.jcws.2010.04.004 |issn=1876-4983 |pmc=3601853 |pmid=24527138}}</ref> 

In venous insufficiency, venous stasis results in abnormally high venous pressure (venous hypertension) and greater permeability of blood capillaries (capillary hyperpermeability), to drain the blood through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system slowly removes excess fluid and proteins from the veins in the lower legs towards the upper body; however, as it is not as efficient as an unimpaired circulatory system, swelling (edema) is visible, particularly in the ankles and lower leg. Unfortunately, the chronic increased fluid in the lymphatic system and capillary hyperpermeability causes an inflammatory response which leads to tissue fibrosis of both veins and lymphatic system, opening of arteriovenous shunts, all of which then worsens the condition in a vicious cycle.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Others ===
Swollen [[human leg|leg]]s, feet and [[ankle]]s are common in late [[pregnancy]]. The problem is partly caused by the weight of the [[uterus]] on the major [[vein]]s of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. It usually clears up after delivery of the baby, and is mostly not a cause for concern,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec18/ch259/ch259e.html |first1=R. Phillips  |last1=Heine |first2=Geeta K. |last2=Swamy |title=Lower-Extremity Edema During Late Pregnancy |work=[[The Merck Manual]] |access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref> though it should always be reported to a doctor.

Lack of exercise is another common cause of water retention in the legs. Exercise helps the leg [[vein]]s work against [[gravity]] to return [[blood]] to the [[human heart|heart]]. If [[blood]] travels too slowly and starts to pool in the [[human leg|leg]] [[vein]]s, the pressure can force too much fluid out of the [[human leg|leg]] [[capillary|capillaries]] into the tissue spaces. The [[capillary|capillaries]] may break, leaving small blood marks under the [[human skin|skin]]. The [[vein]]s themselves can become swollen, painful and distorted – a condition known as [[varicose vein]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introductory Medical-Surgical Nursing |first1=Barbara Kuhn |last1=Timby |first2=Nancy E. |last2=Smith |year=2006 |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductorymedi00timb/page/488 488] |isbn=978-0-78178-032-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductorymedi00timb/page/488 }}</ref> [[Muscle]] action is needed not only to keep [[blood]] flowing through the [[vein]]s but also to stimulate the [[lymphatic system]] to fulfil its "overflow" function. Long-haul [[flight]]s, lengthy [[bed-rest]], immobility caused by [[disability]] and so on, are all potential causes of water retention. Even very small exercises such as rotating [[ankle]]s and wiggling [[toe]]s can help to reduce it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lymphedema Management: The Comprehensive Guide for Practitioners |first=Joachim E. |last=Zuther |year=2005 |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[Thieme Medical Publishers]] |page=222 |isbn=978-1-58890-284-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/lymphedemamanage00joac/page/222 }}</ref>

Certain [[medications]] are prone to causing water retention. These include [[estrogen]]s, thereby including drugs for [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] or the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/estrogens%20(conjugated-equine).html |title=Estrogens (Conjugated/Equine) |work=The Merck Manual |access-date=9 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133613/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/estrogens%20(conjugated-equine).html |archive-date=2 December 2007}}</ref> as well as [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] and [[beta-blockers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/hypertension-treatment-beta-blockers |title=Beta-Blockers for High Blood Pressure |work=[[WebMD]] |access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

== Mechanism ==
Six factors can contribute to the formation of edema:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scallan |first1=Joshua |last2=Huxley |first2=Virginia H. |last3=Korthuis |first3=Ronald J. |title=Pathophysiology of Edema Formation |date=2010 |publisher=Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53445/ |access-date=11 July 2022 |language=en}}</ref>
# increased [[hydrostatic pressure]];
# reduced colloidal or [[oncotic pressure]] within blood vessels;
# increased tissue colloidal or  oncotic pressure;
# increased blood vessel wall permeability (such as [[inflammation]]);
# obstruction of fluid clearance in the [[lymphatic system]];
# changes in the water-retaining properties of the tissues themselves. Raised hydrostatic pressure often reflects retention of water and sodium by the kidneys.<ref>{{cite book| author=Kumar|author2=Abbas|author3=Fausto |title=Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |year=1999 |pages=122 |isbn= 0-7216-0187-1}}</ref>
Generation of interstitial fluid is regulated by the forces of the [[Starling equation]].<ref>{{cite book | last1= Boron | first1= W. F. | last2= Boulpaep | first2= E. L. | year = 2012| title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach| chapter = 2e| publisher =Saunders/Elsevier| place = Philadelphia| pages =| isbn=}}</ref> Hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and tissue. As a result, the colloidal or [[oncotic pressure]] of the higher level of protein in the plasma tends to draw water back into the blood vessels from the tissue. Starling's equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by the difference between the two forces and also by the permeability of the vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post capillary [[venule]]s, which have a [[semi-permeable membrane]] wall that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases with a fall in reflection coefficient.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dvorak |first1=Harold F |title=Vascular permeability to plasma, plasma proteins, and cells: an update |journal=Current Opinion in Hematology |date=April 2010 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=225–229 |doi=10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283386638 |pmid=20375889 |pmc=2878124 }}</ref>

Changes in the variables in Starling's equation can contribute to the formation of edemas either by an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the blood vessel, a decrease in the oncotic pressure within the blood vessel or an increase in vessel wall permeability. The latter has two effects. It allows water to flow more freely and it reduces the colloidal or oncotic pressure difference by allowing protein to leave the vessel more easily.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Another set of vessels known as the [[lymphatic system]] acts like an "overflow" and can return much excess fluid to the [[bloodstream]]. But even the [[lymphatic system]] can be overwhelmed, and if there is simply too much fluid, or if the [[lymphatic system]] is congested, then the fluid will remain in the tissues, causing swellings in [[human leg|leg]]s, [[ankle]]s, feet, [[abdomen]] or any other part of the body.<ref>{{cite book |title=Essentials of Rubin's Pathology |first=Emanuel |last=Rubin |year=2008 |edition=5th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |page=124 |isbn=978-0-78177-324-9}}</ref>

Edema may be described as '''pitting edema''', or '''non-pitting edema'''.<ref name="webmd">{{cite web |last1=Booth |first1=Stephanie |title=Pitting Edema |url=https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/pitting-edema |website=WebMD |access-date=1 January 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Pitting edema is when, after pressure is applied to a small area, the indentation persists after the release of the pressure. [[Peripheral edema|Peripheral]] pitting edema, as shown in the illustration, is the more common type, resulting from water retention. It can be caused by systemic diseases, pregnancy in some women, either directly or as a result of [[heart failure]], or local conditions such as [[varicose veins]], [[thrombophlebitis]], insect bites, and [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Causes and signs of edema |date=30 December 2016 |publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279409/ |access-date=26 July 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

Non-pitting edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with such conditions as [[lymphedema]], [[lipedema]], and [[myxedema]].

Edema caused by malnutrition defines [[kwashiorkor]], an acute form of childhood protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, anorexia, [[Ulcerative dermatitis|ulcerating dermatoses]], and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates.

When possible, treatment involves resolving the underlying cause. Many cases of [[heart]] or [[kidney]] disease are treated with [[diuretics]].<ref name=":0" />

Treatment may also involve positioning the affected body parts to improve drainage. For example, swelling in feet or ankles may be reduced by having the person lie down in bed or sit with the feet propped up on cushions. [[Intermittent pneumatic compression]] can be used to pressurize tissue in a limb, forcing fluids—both blood and [[lymph]]—to flow out of the compressed area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zaleska |first1=Marzanna |last2=Olszewski |first2=Waldemar L. |last3=Cakala |first3=Marta |last4=Cwikla |first4=Jaroslaw |last5=Budlewski |first5=Tadeusz |title=Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Enhances Formation of Edema Tissue Fluid Channels in Lymphedema of Lower Limbs |journal=Lymphatic Research and Biology |date=June 2015 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=146–153 |doi=10.1089/lrb.2014.0010 |pmid=25748341 |pmc=4492553 }}</ref>
