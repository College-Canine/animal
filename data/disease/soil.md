'''Soil''', also commonly referred to as '''earth''' or '''[[dirt]]''', is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support the [[life]] of [[plant]]s and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]]. Some scientific definitions distinguish ''dirt'' from ''soil'' by restricting the former term specifically to displaced soil.

Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a [[Porosity|porous]] phase that holds [[Soil gas|gases]] (the soil atmosphere) and [[water]] (the soil solution).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Voroney |first1=R.

Soil is a major component of the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, with effects ranging from [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] to [[rainforest destruction]] and [[water pollution]].

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] that consists of two or more layers, referred to as soil horizons. These differ in one or more properties such as in their [[Soil texture|texture]], [[structure]], [[density]], porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]].<ref name="Buol"/> The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, though the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}} It has been suggested that the ''pedon'', a column of soil extending vertically from the surface to the underlying parent material and large enough to show the characteristics of all its horizons, could be subdivided in the ''humipedon'' (the living part, where most soil organisms are dwelling, corresponding to the ''humus form''), the ''copedon'' (in intermediary position, where most [[weathering]] of minerals takes place) and the ''lithopedon'' (in contact with the subsoil).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zanella |first1=Augusto |last2=Katzensteiner |first2=Klaus |last3=Ponge |first3=Jean-François |last4=Jabiol |first4=Bernard |last5=Sartori |first5=Giacomo |last6=Kolb |first6=Eckart |last7=Le Bayon |first7=Renée-Claire |last8=Aubert |first8=Michaël |last9=Ascher-Jenull |first9=Judith |last10=Englisch |first10=Michael |last11=Hager |first11=Herbert |title=TerrHum: an iOS App for classifying terrestrial humipedons and some considerations about soil classification |journal=[[Soil Science Society of America Journal]] |date=June 2019 |volume=83 |issue=S1 |pages=S42–S48 |doi=10.2136/sssaj2018.07.0279 |hdl=11577/3315165 |s2cid=197555747 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332080061 |access-date=18 April 2022|hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and colloids are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, [[humus]], [[iron oxide]], [[carbonate]], and [[gypsum]], producing a distinct layer called the B horizon.

== Soil moisture ==
{{Main|Soil moisture}}
Soil [[water content]] can be measured as volume or [[Specific weight#Soil mechanics|weight]]. Soil moisture levels, in order of decreasing water content, are saturation, [[field capacity]], [[wilting point]], air dry, and oven dry. Field capacity describes a drained wet soil at the point water content reaches equilibrium with gravity. Irrigating soil above field capacity risks percolation losses. Wilting point describes the dry limit for growing plants. During growing season, soil moisture is unaffected by functional groups or specie richness.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite journal |last1=Spehn |first1=Eva M. |last2=Joshi |first2=Jasmin |last3=Schmid |first3=Bernhard |last4=Alphei |first4=Jörn |last5=Körner |first5=Christian |date=2000 |title=Plant diversity effects on soil heterotrophic activity in experimental grassland ecosystems |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1023/A:1004891807664 |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=224 |issue=2 |pages=217–230 |doi=10.1023/A:1004891807664|s2cid=25639544 }}</ref>

[[Available water capacity]] is the amount of water held in a soil profile available to plants. As water content drops, plants have to work against increasing forces of [[adhesion]] and [[sorptivity]] to withdraw water. [[Irrigation scheduling]] avoids [[moisture stress]] by replenishing depleted water before stress is induced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Water holding capacity |work=[[Oregon State University]] |date=24 June 2016 |url=https://forages.oregonstate.edu/ssis/soils/characteristics/water-holding-capacity |quote=Irrigators must have knowledge of the readily available moisture capacity so that water can be applied before plants have to expend excessive energy to extract moisture |access-date=9 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Basics of irrigation scheduling |work=[[University of Minnesota Extension]] |url=https://extension.umn.edu/irrigation/basics-irrigation-scheduling |quote=Only a portion of the available water holding capacity is easily used by the crop before crop water stress develop |access-date=9 October 2022}}</ref>

[[Capillary action]] is responsible for moving [[groundwater]] from wet regions of the soil to dry areas. [[Subirrigation]] designs (e.g., [[wicking bed]]s, [[sub-irrigated planter]]s) rely on [[Capillary action|capillarity]] to supply water to plant roots. Capillary action can result in an evaporative concentration of salts, causing land degradation through [[Soil salinity#Dry land salinity|salination]].

== Soil gas ==
{{main|Soil gas}}
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is very different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of oxygen by microbes and plant roots, and their release of carbon dioxide, decreases oxygen and increases carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil pore space it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–442 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x |pmid=33874575 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Calcareous soils regulate CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO<sub>2</sub> respired accumulates in the soil pore system.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8337234 |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |access-date=13 November 2022 |bibcode=2005Oecol.142..296K |s2cid=6161016}}</ref> At extreme levels, CO<sub>2</sub> is toxic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.T. |last2=Loomis |first2=Walter E. |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=20 |issue=2 |title=Effect of carbon dioxide on absorption of water and nutrients by roots |year=1945 |pages=221–232 |doi=10.1104/pp.20.2.221 |pmid=16653979 |pmc=437214 }}</ref> This suggests a possible [[negative feedback]] control of soil CO<sub>2</sub> concentration through its inhibitory effects on root and microbial respiration (also called [[soil respiration]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McDowell |first1=Nate J. |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Qi |first3=Jingen |last4=Mattson |first4=Kim |journal=Tree Physiology |volume=19 |issue=9 |title=Direct inhibition of maintenance respiration in western hemlock roots exposed to ambient soil carbon dioxide concentrations |year=1999 |pages=599–605 |doi=10.1093/treephys/19.9.599 |pmid=12651534 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In addition, the soil voids are saturated with water vapour, at least until the point of maximal [[hygroscopic]]ity, beyond which a [[vapour-pressure deficit]] occurs in the soil pore space.<ref name="Vannier1987"/> Adequate porosity is necessary, not just to allow the penetration of water, but also to allow gases to diffuse in and out.

== Soil biodiversity ==
Large numbers of [[Microorganism|microbes]], [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] are living in soil. However, [[biodiversity]] in soil is much harder to study as most of this life is invisible, hence estimates about soil biodiversity have been unsatisfactory. A recent study suggested that soil is likely home to 59 ± 15% of the species on Earth. [[Enchytraeidae]] (worms) have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6%), followed by fungi (90%), plants (85.5%), and termites ([[Termite|Isoptera]]) (84.2%). Many other groups of animals have substantial fractions of species living in soil, e.g. about 30% of [[insect]]s, and close to 50% of [[arachnid]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Anthony |first1=Mark A. |last2=Bender |first2=S.

==Chemistry==
{{for|the academic discipline|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its living population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its [[corrosivity]], stability, and ability to [[Sorption|absorb]] [[pollutants]] and to filter water. It is the [[surface chemistry]] of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sposito |first=Garrison |date=1984 |title=The surface chemistry of soils |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |url=https://epdf.pub/the-surface-chemistry-of-soils.html |access-date=15 January 2023}}</ref> A colloid is a small, insoluble particle ranging in size from 1 [[nanometer]] to 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]], thus small enough to remain suspended by [[Brownian motion]] in a fluid medium without settling.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wynot |first=Christopher |title=Theory of diffusion in colloidal suspensions |url=http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ceng402/proj02/cwynot/402project.htm |access-date=15 January 2023}}</ref> Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called [[humus]] as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of [[clays]]. The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net [[electrical charge]]s give soil its ability to hold and release [[ions]]. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release [[cations]] in what is referred to as [[cation exchange]]. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] is the amount of exchangeable [[cations]] per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of [[milliequivalents]] of [[positively charged]] ions per 100&nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol<sub>c</sub>/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release [[anions]] in the soil, giving the soil anion exchange capacity.

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, [[Buffer solution|buffers]] (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies [[Percolation|percolating]] water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–106}}

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as cations differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another ([[ion exchange]]). If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al<sup>3+</sup> replaces H<sup>+</sup> replaces Ca<sup>2+</sup> replaces Mg<sup>2+</sup> replaces K<sup>+</sup> same as {{chem|NH|4|+}} replaces Na<sup>+</sup><ref>{{cite journal |last=Woodruff |first=Clarence M. |year=1955 |title=The energies of replacement of calcium by potassium in soils |journal=[[Soil Science Society of America Journal]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=167–171 |doi=10.2136/sssaj1955.03615995001900020014x |url=https://www.ipipotash.org/uploads/pdf/review/30_1956_1.pdf |bibcode=1955SSASJ..19..167W |access-date=15 January 2023}}</ref>

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called [[law of mass action]]. This is largely what occurs with the addition of cationic [[Fertilizer|fertilisers]] ([[potash]], [[Lime (material)|lime]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fronæus |first=Sture |year=1953 |title=On the application of the mass action law to cation exchange equilibria |journal=[[Acta Chemica Scandinavica]] |volume=7 |pages=469–480 |doi=10.3891/acta.chem.scand.07-0469 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low [[pH]], meaning an abundance of H<sup>+</sup>), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy exchange sites ([[protonation]]).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the [[acid]]ity or [[Base (chemistry)|alkalinity]] of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of [[hydronium]] concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Bryan |title=pH requirements of freshwater aquatic life |url=https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/basin_plans/ph_turbidity/ph_turbidity_04phreq.pdf |access-date=6 June 2021 |archive-date=8 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508070517/https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralvalley/water_issues/basin_plans/ph_turbidity/ph_turbidity_04phreq.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

At 25&nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10<sup>−3.5</sup> [[mole (unit)|moles]] H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (hydronium ions) per litre of solution (and also 10<sup>−10.5</sup> moles per litre OH<sup>−</sup>). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10<sup>−7</sup> moles of hydronium ions per litre of solution and also 10<sup>−7</sup> moles of OH<sup>−</sup> per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10<sup>−9.5</sup> moles hydronium ions per litre of solution (and also 10<sup>−2.5</sup> moles per litre OH<sup>−</sup>). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydronium ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 ({{nowrap|9.5 − 3.5 {{=}} 6}} or 10<sup>6</sup>) and is more acidic.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Chang |editor-first=Raymond |title=Chemistry |journal=Chemistry - Chang 12Ed |date=2010 |edition=12th |url=https://www.academia.edu/44394574 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=9780078021510 |page=666 |access-date=6 June 2021}}</ref>

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidify as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydronium ions from usual or unusual [[Acid rain|rain acidity]] against those attached to the colloids.

==== Base saturation percentage ====
There are acid-forming cations (e.g. hydronium, aluminium, iron) and there are base-forming cations (e.g. calcium, magnesium, sodium). The fraction of the negatively-charged soil colloid exchange sites (CEC) that are occupied by base-forming cations is called [[base saturation]]. If a soil has a CEC of 20&nbsp;meq and 5&nbsp;meq are aluminium and hydronium cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids ({{nowrap|1=20 − 5 = 15 meq}}) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the base saturation is {{nowrap|1=15 ÷ 20 × 100% = 75%}} (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (it increases with increasing pH).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McFee |first1=William W. |last2=Kelly |first2=J.

====Buffering====
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, though soils high in colloids (whether mineral or organic) have high [[buffering capacity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sposito |first1=Garrison |last2=Skipper |first2=Neal T. |last3=Sutton |first3=Rebecca |last4=Park |first4=Sun-Ho |last5=Soper |first5=Alan K. |last6=Greathouse |first6=Jeffery A. |year=1999 |title=Surface geochemistry of the clay minerals |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=3358–3364 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.7.3358 |pmid=10097044 |pmc=34275 |bibcode=1999PNAS...96.3358S |doi-access=free}}</ref> Buffering occurs by cation exchange and [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralisation]].

The addition of a small amount of highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the [[ammonium]] to displace hydronium ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, will displace hydronium ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–121}}

=== Redox ===
{{main|Redox#Redox_reactions_in_soils}}
{{See also|Table of standard reduction potentials for half-reactions important in biochemistry}}

Soil chemical reactions involve some combination of proton and electron transfer. Oxidation occurs if there is a loss of electrons in the transfer process while reduction occurs if there is a gain of electrons. [[Reduction potential]] is measured in volts or millivolts. Soil microbial communities develop along [[electron transport chain]]s, forming electrically conductive [[Geobacter#Biofilm conductivity|biofilms]], and developing networks of [[bacterial nanowires]].

Redox factors in soil development, where formation of [[redoximorphic features|redoximorphic color features]] provides critical information for soil interpretation. Understanding the [[Redox gradient#Terrestrial Environments|redox gradient]] is important to managing carbon sequestration, bioremediation, [[Pedosphere#Redox conditions in wetland soils|wetland delineation]], and [[soil-based microbial fuel cell]]s.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an [[Ionic compound|ionic]] form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within [[Primary mineral|primary]] and [[Secondary mineral|secondary minerals]], they weather too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, the application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and soil organic matter provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of soil organic matter by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.<ref name="Roy2006Chapter4">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf |title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management |last1=Roy |first1=R.

{{main|Soil organic matter}}{{Overly detailed|section|details=details could be moved into main article|date=April 2021}}
The organic material in soil is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead.

Most living things in soils, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by [[protozoa]], which in turn are fed upon by [[nematodes]], [[annelids]] and [[arthropod]]s, themselves able to consume and transform raw or humified organic matter. This has been called the [[soil food web]], through which all organic matter is processed as in a [[digestive system]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scheu |first=Stefan |year=2002 |title=The soil food web: structure and perspectives |journal=European Journal of Soil Biology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=11–20 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263041521 |doi=10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01117-7 |bibcode=2002EJSB...38...11S |access-date=4 July 2021}}</ref> Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.<ref name=Foth1984>{{Cite book |last=Foth |first=Henry D. |year=1984 |title=Fundamentals of soil science |edition=8th |page=139 |url=http://base.dnsgb.com.ua/files/book/Agriculture/Soil/Fundamentals-of-Soil-Science.pdf |isbn=978-0471522799 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York, New York |access-date=4 July 2021}}</ref> In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In [[grassland]], much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker [[A horizon]] with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor ([[O horizon]]) and thin A horizon.<ref name="Ponge2003">{{cite journal |last=Ponge |first=Jean-François |year=2003 |title=Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity |journal=[[Soil Biology and Biochemistry]] |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=935–945 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4 |url=https://www.academia.edu/45579598 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430 |archive-date=29 January 2016 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.467.4937 |s2cid=44160220}}</ref>

===Humus===
Humus refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil microflora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown.

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present.<ref name="Ponge2003"/> Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].<ref name="Foth1984"/> Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states to a higher extent than clay, increasing soil porosity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peng |first1=Xinhua |last2=Horn |first2=Rainer |title=Anisotropic shrinkage and swelling of some organic and inorganic soils |journal=European Journal of Soil Science |year=2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=98–107 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00808.x |bibcode=2007EuJSS..58...98P |doi-access=free}}</ref> Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminishes without the addition of new organic matter.

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a soil horizon. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers which describe the horizon in terms of its colour, size, texture, structure, consistency, root quantity, pH, voids, boundary characteristics and presence of nodules or concretions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://soilsofcanada.ca/soil-formation/horizons.php |title=Horizons |website=Soils of Canada |access-date=1 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922153041/https://soilsofcanada.ca/soil-formation/horizons.php |archive-date=22 September 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> No soil profile has all the major horizons.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

One of the first soil classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] around 1880.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fr.scribd.com/doc/206859253/Russian-Chernozem |title=Russian Chernozem |last=Dokuchaev |first=Vasily Vasilyevich |publisher=Israel Program for Scientific Translations |location=Jerusalem, Israel |year=1967 |access-date=15 August 2021}}</ref> It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers and was developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then, it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]]<ref name=WRB>{{Cite web|url = https://www3.ls.tum.de/boku/?id=1419|title = World Reference Base for Soil Resources, 4th edition|author=IUSS Working Group WRB|year = 2022|publisher = IUSS, Vienna}}</ref> aims to establish an international reference base for soil classification.

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated. [[Agricultural soil science]] was the primeval domain of soil knowledge, long time before the advent of [[pedology]] in the 19th century. However, as demonstrated by [[aeroponics]], [[aquaponics]] and [[hydroponics]], soil material is not an absolute essential for agriculture, and soilless cropping systems have been claimed as the future of agriculture for an endless growing mankind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sambo |first1=Paolo |last2=Nicoletto |first2=Carlo |last3=Giro |first3=Andrea |last4=Pii |first4=Youry |last5=Valentinuzzi |first5=Fabio |last6=Mimmo |first6=Tanja |last7=Lugli |first7=Paolo |last8=Orzes |first8=Guido |last9=Mazzetto |first9=Fabrizio |last10=Astolfi |first10=Stefania |last11=Terzano |first11=Roberto |last12=Cesco |first12=Stefano |year=2019 |title=Hydroponic solutions for soilless production systems: issues and opportunities in a smart agriculture perspective |journal=[[Frontiers in Plant Science]] |volume=10 |issue=123 |page=923 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2019.00923 |pmid=31396245 |pmc=6668597 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even in deserts, cyanobacteria, [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es form [[biological soil crust]]s which capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by [[photosynthesis]].

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] soil processes. Land application of [[waste water]] relies on [[soil biology]] to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]. Alternatively, [[landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]], isolating waste deposits from the atmosphere and preventing unpleasant smells. [[Composting]] is now widely used to treat aerobically solid domestic waste and dried effluents of [[settling basin]]s. Although compost is not soil, biological processes taking place during composting are similar to those occurring during decomposition and humification of soil organic matter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mondini |first1=Claudio |last2=Contin |first2=Marco |last3=Leita |first3=Liviana |last4=De Nobili |first4=Maria |year=2002 |title=Response of microbial biomass to air-drying and rewetting in soils and compost |journal=Geoderma |volume=105 |issue=1–2 |pages=111–124 |url=https://www.academia.edu/5321925 |doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(01)00095-7 |bibcode=2002Geode.105..111M |access-date=22 August 2021}}</ref>

=== Acidification ===
Soil acidification is beneficial in the case of [[alkaline soil]]s, but it degrades land when it lowers [[crop productivity]], soil biological activity and increases soil vulnerability to [[contamination]] and erosion. Soils are initially acid and remain such when their parent materials are low in basic [[cation]]s (calcium, magnesium, potassium and [[sodium]]). On parent materials richer in [[mineral weathering|weatherable minerals]] acidification occurs when basic cations are [[Leaching (pedology)|leached]] from the soil profile by rainfall or exported by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]]. [[Deforestation]] is another cause of soil acidification, mediated by increased leaching of soil nutrients in the absence of [[tree canopies]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sumner |first1=Malcolm E. |last2=Noble |first2=Andrew D. |year=2003 |chapter=Soil acidification: the world story |title=Handbook of soil acidity |pages=1–28 |editor-last=Rengel |editor-first=Zdenko |chapter-url=https://pdf-drive.com/pdf/Zdenko20Rengel20-20Handbook20of20Soil20Acidity2028Books20in20Soils2C20Plants2C20and20the20Environment292028200329.pdf#page=16 |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |location=New York, NY, USA |access-date=29 August 2021 |archive-date=14 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814115102/https://pdf-drive.com/pdf/Zdenko20Rengel20-20Handbook20of20Soil20Acidity2028Books20in20Soils2C20Plants2C20and20the20Environment292028200329.pdf#page=16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In Europe it has been estimated that for every million inhabitants 113 to 770 tonnes of microplastics are added to agricultural soils each year.<ref name="auto"/>

===Desertification===
[[File:Soil erosion, Southfield - geograph.org.uk - 367917.jpg|thumb|Desertification]]

[[Desertification]], an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, is often caused by badly adapted human activities such as [[overgrazing]] or excess harvesting of [[firewood]]. It is a common misconception that [[drought]] causes desertification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Le Houérou |first=Henry N. |year=1996 |title=Climate change, drought and desertification |journal=[[Journal of Arid Environments]] |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=133–185 |doi=10.1006/jare.1996.0099 |bibcode=1996JArEn..34..133L |url=http://www7.nau.edu/mpcer/direnet/publications/publications_l/files/LeHouerou_1996.pdf |access-date=5 September 2021}}</ref> Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands.

===Erosion===
[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially unsuitable land use practices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Dawen |last2=Kanae |first2=Shinjiro |last3=Oki |first3=Taikan |last4=Koike |first4=Toshio |last5=Musiake |first5=Katumi |year=2003 |title=Global potential soil erosion with reference to land use and climate changes |journal=Hydrological Processes |volume=17 |issue=14 |pages=2913–28 |doi=10.1002/hyp.1441 |bibcode=2003HyPr...17.2913Y |s2cid=129355387 |url=https://www.oieau.org/eaudoc/system/files/documents/38/191115/191115_doc.pdf |access-date=5 September 2021 |archive-date=18 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818043117/https://www.oieau.org/eaudoc/system/files/documents/38/191115/191115_doc.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The sediment originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ran |first1=Lishan |last2=Lu |first2=Xi Xi |last3=Xin |first3=Zhongbao |year=2014 |title=Erosion-induced massive organic carbon burial and carbon emission in the Yellow River basin, China |journal=[[Biogeosciences]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=945–959 |doi=10.5194/bg-11-945-2014 |bibcode=2014BGeo...11..945R |url=https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/945/2014/bg-11-945-2014.pdf |access-date=5 September 2021 |hdl=10722/228184 |hdl-access=free |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Salination===
[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include [[corrosion]] damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and [[water quality]] problems due to [[sedimentation]]. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oosterbaan |first=Roland J. |title=Effectiveness and social/environmental impacts of irrigation projects: a critical review |series=Annual Reports of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) |year=1988 |pages=18–34 |location=Wageningen, The Netherlands |url=http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2009 |df=dmy-all |access-date=5 September 2021}}</ref> All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater.

== Reclamation ==
{{Main|Soil regeneration}}
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays with high swelling properties, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich [[Paddy field|paddy]] soils of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world. However, the overuse of mineral nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s and pesticides in [[Irrigation|irrigated]] intensive [[Rice production in Thailand|rice production]] has endangered these soils, forcing farmers to implement [[integrated farming|integrated practices]] based on Cost Reduction Operating Principles.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stuart |first1=Alexander M. |last2=Pame |first2=Anny Ruth P. |last3=Vithoonjit |first3=Duangporn |last4=Viriyangkura |first4=Ladda |last5=Pithuncharurnlap |first5=Julmanee |last6=Meesang |first6=Nisa |last7=Suksiri |first7=Prarthana |last8=Singleton |first8=Grant R. |last9=Lampayan |first9=Rubenito M. |year=2018 |title=The application of best management practices increases the profitability and sustainability of rice farming in the central plains of Thailand |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314091782 |journal=Field Crops Research |volume=220 |pages=78–87 |doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2017.02.005 |bibcode=2018FCrRe.220...78S |access-date=12 September 2021}}</ref>

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter and clay in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined and soil erosion has increased in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand, following the abandonment of [[shifting cultivation]] for a more permanent land use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Turkelboom |first1=Francis |last2=Poesen |first2=Jean |last3=Ohler |first3=Ilse |last4=Van Keer |first4=Koen |last5=Ongprasert |first5=Somchai |last6=Vlassak |first6=Karel |year=1997 |title=Assessment of tillage erosion rates on steep slopes in northern Thailand |url=https://www.academia.edu/17993140 |journal=Catena |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=29–44 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00063-X |bibcode=1997Caten..29...29T |access-date=12 September 2021}}</ref> Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter and clay from [[Mound-building termites|termite mound]] material, but this was [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] in the long-term because of rarefaction of termite mounds.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, IWMI scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name="Water Management Institute2010">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2012 |author=[[International Water Management Institute]] |doi-access=free |access-date=12 September 2021}}</ref>

Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.<ref name="Brady">{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-02-313340-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/natureproperties00brad_0 |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref>{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of soil fertility. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [[Combustion|combust]] oxygen internally to live. He was able to deduce that most of the {{convert|165|lb|adj=on}} weight of van Helmont's willow tree derived from air.<ref>{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.<ref>{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1–5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref>

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and {{Not a typo|(re)discovered}} that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the [[superphosphate]], consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |access-date=17 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123214241/http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |archive-date=23 January 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms was still not understood.

In 1856, J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the power of soils to absorb manure |year=1852 |volume=13 |pages=123–143 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/45583402 |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> and twenty years later [[Robert Warington]] proved that this transformation was done by living organisms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Warington |first=Robert |title=Note on the appearance of nitrous acid during the evaporation of water: a report of experiments made in the Rothamsted laboratory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NlISAQAAMAAJ |year=1878 |publisher=[[Harrison and Sons]] |location=London, United Kingdom |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> In 1890 [[Sergei Winogradsky]] announced he had found the bacteria responsible for this transformation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Winogradsky |first=Sergei |journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences]] |title=Sur les organismes de la nitrification |language=fr |trans-title=On the organisms of nitrification |year=1890 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=1013–1016 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30663/f1087?lang=EN |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref>

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in nitrogen fixation by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

Crop rotation, mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Studies of soil formation===
{{See also|Soil formation}}
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of biotic and abiotic processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, other researchers began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, while in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] (1833–1916) studied the relationship between rock material, climate, vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered the classification of soil types.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1907 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/24461 |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> His work was not continued. At about the same time, [[Friedrich Albert Fallou]] was describing soil profiles and relating soil characteristics to their formation as part of his professional work evaluating forest and farm land for the principality of [[Saxony]]. His 1857 book, {{Lang|de|Anfangsgründe der Bodenkunde}} (First principles of soil science), established modern soil science.<ref>{{cite book |language=de |last=Fallou |first=Friedrich Albert |title=Anfangsgründe der Bodenkunde |year= 1857 |publisher=G. Schönfeld's Buchhandlung |location= Dresden, Germany |url=http://digital.slub-dresden.de/fileadmin/data/321768043/321768043_tif/jpegs/321768043.pdf |access-date=15 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223343/http://digital.slub-dresden.de/fileadmin/data/321768043/321768043_tif/jpegs/321768043.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Contemporary with Fallou's work, and driven by the same need to accurately assess land for equitable taxation, Vasily Dokuchaev led a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, observing that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.<ref>{{cite book |language=de |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}</ref>

[[Curtis F. Marbut]], influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,<ref>{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |url=http://reader.library.cornell.edu/docviewer/digital?id=chla3055800#mode/1up |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> and, as he was placed in charge of the U.S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.<ref name="Brady"/>
