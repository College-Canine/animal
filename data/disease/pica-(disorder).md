'''Pica''' is the eating or craving of things that are not food.<ref>OED ed. 3 via Apple Dictionary.</ref> It is classified as an eating disorder but can also be the result of an existing mental disorder.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|series=DSM Library|chapter=Feeding and Eating Disorders|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm10|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse|via=archive.org}}</ref> The ingested or craved substance may be biological, natural or manmade.

According to the ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition]]'' (DSM-5), pica as a standalone [[eating disorder]] must persist for more than one month at an age when eating such objects is considered [[Cognitive development|developmentally]] inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice, and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

==Causes==
Pica is currently recognized as a mental disorder by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5). According to the DSM-5, mineral deficiencies are occasionally associated with pica, but biological abnormalities are rarely found.<ref name=":3"/> People practicing forms of pica, such as [[Geophagia|geophagy]], [[Pagophagia|pagophagy]], and [[Amylophagia|amylophagy]], are more likely to be anemic or to have low [[hemoglobin]] concentration in their blood, lower levels of red blood cells ([[hematocrit]]), or lower plasma zinc levels.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Miao|first1=Diana|last2=Young|first2=Sera L.|last3=Golden|first3=Christopher D.|date=January 2015|title=A meta-analysis of pica and micronutrient status|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=84–93|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22598|issn=1520-6300|pmc=4270917|pmid=25156147}}</ref> Specifically, practicing geophagy is more likely to be associated with anemia or low hemoglobin.<ref name=":1" /> Practicing pagophagy and amylophagy is more highly associated with anemia.<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, children and pregnant women may be more likely to have anemia or low hemoglobin relative to the general population.<ref name=":1" /> Mental health conditions such as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) and [[schizophrenia]] have been proposed as causes of pica.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gull|first=William W.|author-link=William Gull|year=1874|title=Anorexia nervosa (apepsia hysterica, anorexia hysterica)|journal=Trans.

==Diagnosis==
No single test confirms pica, but because pica can occur in people who have lower than normal nutrient levels and poor nutrition (malnutrition), the health care provider should test blood levels of iron and zinc.
Hemoglobin can also be checked to test for [[anemia]]. Lead levels should always be checked in children who may have eaten paint or objects covered in lead-paint dust. The healthcare provider should test for infection if the patient has been eating contaminated soil or animal waste.<ref name="Pica"/>

===DSM-5===
The DSM-5 posits four criteria that must be met for a person to be diagnosed with pica:<ref name=":3" />

#Person must have been eating non-nutritive nonfoods for at least one month.<ref name=":3" />
#This eating must be considered abnormal for the person's stage of development.<ref name=":3" />
#Eating these substances cannot be associated with a cultural practice that is considered normal in the social context of the individual.<ref name=":3" />
#For people who currently have a medical condition (e.g.: pregnancy) or a mental disorder (e.g.: [[autism spectrum]]), the action of eating non-nutritive nonfoods should only be considered pica if it is dangerous and requires extra medical investigation or treatment on top of what they are already receiving for their pre-existing condition.<ref name=":3" />

===Differential diagnosis===
In individuals with [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], and certain physical disorders (such as [[Kleine–Levin syndrome]]), non-nutritive substances may be eaten. In such instances, pica should only be noted as an additional diagnosis if the eating behaviour is sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention.<ref name=":3" />

==Treatment==
Treatment for pica may vary by patient and suspected cause (e.g., child, developmentally disabled, pregnant, or psychogenic) and may emphasize [[psychosocial]], environmental and family-guidance approaches; [[iron deficiency]] may be treatable through iron supplements or through dietary changes. An initial approach often involves screening for, and if necessary, treating any mineral deficiencies or other [[Comorbidity|comorbid conditions]].<ref name=Rose00/> For pica that appears to be of psychogenic cause, therapy and medication such as [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] have been used successfully.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatia MS, Gupta R | date = 2007-05-11 | title = Pica responding to SSRI: An OCD spectrum disorder? | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | pmid = 17853279 | doi = 10.1080/15622970701308389 | volume = 10 | issue = 4–3 | pages = 936–8| s2cid = 30089547 }}</ref> However, previous reports have cautioned against the use of medication until all non-psychogenic causes have been ruled out.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fotoulaki M, Panagopoulou P, Efstratiou I, Nousia-Arvanitakis S | year = 2007 | title = Pitfalls in the approach to pica | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 166 | issue = 6 | pages = 623–4 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-006-0282-1 | pmid = 17008997 | s2cid = 1429977 }}</ref>

Looking back at the different causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician tries to develop a treatment. First, there is pica as a result of social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person's behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual's communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other nonmedication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a "pica box" that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.<ref name=Blinder2008 />

Behavior-based treatment options for pica can be useful for individuals who have a developmental disability or mental illness. Behavioral treatments have been shown to reduce pica severity by 80% in people with intellectual disabilities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hagopian|first1=Louis P.|last2=Rooker|first2=Griffin W.|last3=Rolider|first3=Natalie U.|title=Identifying empirically supported treatments for pica in individuals with intellectual disabilities|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|volume=32|issue=6|pages=2114–2120|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.07.042|pmid=21862281|year=2011}}</ref> These treatments may involve using [[positive reinforcement]] normal behavior. Many use aversion therapy, where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often, treatment is similar to the treatment of obsessive–compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases, treatment is as simple as addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it. A recent study classified nine such classes of behavioral intervention: Success with treatment is generally high and generally fades with age, but it varies depending on the cause of the disorder. Developmental causes tend to have a lower success rate.<ref name=McAdam2004>{{Cite journal|last1=McAdam|first1=David B.|last2=Sherman|first2=James A.|last3=Sheldon|first3=Jan B.|last4=Napolitano|first4=Deborah A.|date=January 2004|title=Behavioral interventions to reduce the pica of persons with developmental disabilities|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=28|issue=1|pages=45–72|doi=10.1177/0145445503259219|issn=0145-4455|pmid=14710707|s2cid=12112249}}</ref>

The prevalence of pica is difficult to establish because of differences in definition and the reluctance of patients to admit to abnormal cravings and ingestion,<ref name=Blinder2008 /> thus leading to the [[prevalence]] recordings of pica among at-risk groups being in the range of 8% to 65% depending on the study.<ref name=Span04/> Based on compiled self-report and interview data of pregnant and postpartum women, pica is most prevalent geographically in Africa, with an estimated prevalence of 44.8%, followed by North and South America (23.0%) and Eurasia (17.5%).<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Fawcett|first1=Emily J.|last2=Fawcett|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Mazmanian|first3=Dwight|date=June 2016|title=A meta-analysis of the worldwide prevalence of pica during pregnancy and the postpartum period|journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|volume=133|issue=3|pages=277–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.10.012|issn=1879-3479|pmid=26892693|s2cid=205265004}}</ref> Factors associated with Pica in this population were determined to be anemia and low levels of education, both of which are associated with low socioeconomic backgrounds.<ref name=":2" /> Two studies of adults with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] living in [[Psychiatric hospital|institutions]] found that 21.8%<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashworth M, Hirdes JP, Martin L | year = 2009 | title = The social and recreational characteristics of adults with intellectual disability and pica living in institutions | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 512–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2008.07.010 | pmid = 18789647 }}</ref> and 25.8%<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Danford DE, Huber AM | year = 1982 | title = Pica among mentally retarded adults | journal = American Journal of Mental Deficiency | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–6 | pmid = 7124824 }}</ref> of these groups had pica.<ref name="Hartmann">{{cite journal|title=Pica and Rumination Disorder in DSM-5|vauthors=Hartmann AS, Becker AE, Hamptom C, Bryant-Waugh R | journal=Psychiatric Annals |date= November 2012 |volume= 42 |issue= 11 |pages= 426–30 |doi= 10.3928/00485713-20121105-09}}</ref>

==History==
The condition currently known as pica was first described by [[Hippocrates]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Michalska|first1=Aneta|last2=Szejko|first2=Natalia|last3=Jakubczyk|first3=Andrzej|last4=Wojnar|first4=Marcin|date=2016|title=Nonspecific eating disorders - a subjective review|journal=Psychiatria Polska|volume=50|issue=3|pages=497–507|doi=10.12740/PP/59217|doi-access=free|issn=2391-5854|pmid=27556109}}</ref>

In the southern United States in the 1800s, geophagia was a common practice among the slave population.<ref name=Rose00 /> Geophagia is a form of pica in which the person consumes earthly substances such as [[clay]], and is particularly prevalent to augment a mineral-deficient diet.<ref>{{cite web|title=geophagy|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/geophagy?show=0&t=1320448115|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|access-date=27 October 2014}}</ref> Noteworthy is the fact that kaolin was consumed by West Africans enslaved in the Southeastern United States, particularly the Georgia belt, due to the antidiarrheal qualities in the treatment of dysentery and other abdominal ailments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life Traces of the Georgia Coast: Revealing the Unseen Lives of Plants and Animals|last=Martin|first=Anthony|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-253-00602-8|pages=43}}</ref> The practice of consuming kaolin rocks was thereafter studied scientifically, the results of which led to the subsequent pharmaceutical commercialization of kaolinite, the clay mineral contained in kaolin. Kaolinite became the active ingredient in antidiarrheal drugs such as [[Kaopectate]], although it was replaced by [[Palygorskite|attapulgite]] in the 1980s and by [[bismuth subsalicylate]] starting in 2004.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Diarrhea: Sweeping Changes in the OTC Market|first1=W.

Research on [[eating disorder]]s from the 16th to the 20th centuries suggests that during that time in history, pica was regarded more as a symptom of other disorders rather than its own specific disorder. Even today, what could be classified as pica behavior is a normative practice in some cultures as part of their beliefs, healing methods, or religious ceremonies.<ref name=Rose00 />

Prior to the elimination of the category of "feeding disorders in infancy and early childhood", which is where pica was classified, from the DSM-5, pica was primarily diagnosed in children.<ref name=":0" /> However, since the removal of the category, psychiatrists have started to diagnose pica in people of all ages.<ref name=":0" />

==Animals==
Unlike in humans, pica in dogs or cats may be a sign of [[Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]], especially when it involves eating substances such as tile [[grout]], [[concrete]] dust, and [[sand]]. Dogs exhibiting this form of pica should be tested for anemia with a [[complete blood count]] or at least [[hematocrit]] levels.<ref>{{cite book | last = Plunkett | first = Signe J. | year = 2000 | title = Emergency Procedures for the Small Animal Veterinarian | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | pages = 11 | isbn = 978-0-7020-2487-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Feldman | first = Bernard F. |author2=Joseph G.
