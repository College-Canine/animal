==Medical uses==
===Bed wetting ===
Desmopressin is used to treat [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bedwetting). It is usually prescribed in the form of desmopressin acetate, by mouth. Children taking DDAVP have 2.2 fewer wet nights per week and are 4.5 times more likely to sleep without disruption compared with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JH | title = Evidence based management of nocturnal enuresis | journal = BMJ | volume = 323 | issue = 7322 | pages = 1167–1169 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11711411 | pmc = 1121645 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7322.1167 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = [Not Available] | journal = Paediatrics & Child Health | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 616–620 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 19668677 | pmc = 2722621 | doi = 10.1093/pch/10.10.616 }}</ref>

===Nocturia===
In 2017, the FDA approved Desmopressin has some benefit for adults who have problems with [[nocturia]] (having a need to wake up at night for urination).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebell MH, Radke T, Gardner J | title = A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of desmopressin for nocturia in adults | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 192 | issue = 3 | pages = 829–835 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24704009 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2014.03.095 }}</ref><ref name="FDA2017">{{cite press release|title=FDA approves first treatment for frequent urination at night due to overproduction of urine|date=3 March 2017|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm544877.htm|website=www.fda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306193439/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm544877.htm|archive-date=2017-03-06}}</ref>

===Bleeding disorders===
Desmopressin (DDAVP) is usually the first line treatment for mild to moderate type 1 [[von Willebrand disease]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is not recommended in severe disease or in those with abnormal [[factor VIII]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Usefulness in type 2A, 2M, or 2N von Willebrand disease is variable.<ref name=AHFS2016/> Generally not recommended in 2B and type 3 von Willebrand disease.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

Desmopressin is only recommended in mild hemophilia A.<ref name=AHFS2016/> It may be used both for bleeding due to trauma or to try to prevent bleeding due to surgery.<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is not effective in the treatment of hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) or severe hemophilia A.<ref name=AHFS2016/> May also be used in [[uremia]] induced bleeding.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

===Diabetes insipidus===
Desmopressin is used in the treatment of [[neurogenic diabetes insipidus|central diabetes insipidus]] (DI) as a replacement for endogenous [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) that is in insufficient quantity due to decreased or non-existent secretion or production of ADH by the posterior pituitary or hypothalamus, respectively. It is also used in the [[diabetes insipidus#Diagnosis|diagnostic workup for diabetes insipidus]], in order to distinguish central from [[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus|DI due to the kidneys]]. Desmopressin is not effective at treating nephrogenic DI, thus a positive response is generally indicative of central DI.

==Side effects==
* [[headache]]s
* [[Flushing (physiology)|facial flushing]]
* [[nausea]]
* [[hyponatremia]]<ref name=FDA2017/>
* [[seizures]]

US drug regulators added warning to the nasal sprays after two people died and fifty-nine other people had seizures. This occurred due to [[hyponatremia]], a deficit of the body's sodium levels, and the nasal spray is no longer approved for use in children in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/news/20071204/2-deaths-spur-bedwetting-drug-warning |title=2 Deaths Spur sleep apnea Drug Warning |author=Miranda Hitti |date=4 December 2007 |website=WebMD |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207224633/http://www.webmd.com/news/20071204/2-deaths-spur-bedwetting-drug-warning |archive-date=2007-12-07 |access-date=2011-04-18}}</ref> However, US drug regulators have said that desmopressin tablets can still be considered safe for treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children as long as the person is otherwise healthy.

Patients must stop taking desmopressin if they develop severe vomiting and diarrhea, fever, the flu, or severe cold. Patients should also be very cautious about taking desmopressin during hot weather conditions or following strenuous exercise, as these conditions can place stress on the body's electrolyte and water balance.

A body needs to maintain a balance of water and [[sodium]].  If sodium levels become too low ([[hyponatremia]]) – either as a result of increased water take-up or reduced salt levels – a person may have [[seizures]] and, in extreme cases, may die.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/desmopressinHCP.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals — Desmopressin Acetate (marketed as DDAVP Nasal Spray, DDAVP Rhinal Tube, DDAVP, DDVP, Minirin, and Stimate Nasal Spray) |date=December 4, 2007 |website=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |publisher=FDA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213200539/https://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/desmopressinHCP.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Desmopressin works by limiting the amount of water that is eliminated in the urine; that is, it is an [[antidiuretic]]. It works at the level of the [[nephron|renal collecting duct]] by binding to [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 2|V2 receptor]]s, which signal for the translocation of [[aquaporin|aquaporin channels]] via cytosolic vesicles to the apical membrane of the collecting duct. The presence of these aquaporin channels in the distal nephron causes increasing water reabsorption from the urine, which becomes passively re-distributed from the nephron to systemic circulation by way of basolateral membrane channels.<ref name="pmid24294289">{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman FM, Weiss JP | title = Desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia: clinical evidence and experience | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Urology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 310–317 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24294289 | pmc = 3825109 | doi = 10.1177/1756287213502116 }}</ref> Desmopressin also stimulates release of [[von Willebrand factor]] from [[endothelial cell]]s by acting on the V2 receptor. It also increases endogenous levels of factor VIII, making it useful in the treatment of hemophilia A.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loomans JI, Kruip MJ, Carcao M, Jackson S, van Velzen AS, Peters M, Santagostino E, Platokouki H, Beckers E, Voorberg J, van der Bom JG, Fijnvandraat K | display-authors = 6 | title = Desmopressin in moderate hemophilia A patients: a treatment worth considering | journal = Haematologica | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 550–557 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29305412 | pmc = 5830393 | doi = 10.3324/haematol.2017.180059 }}</ref>

Desmopressin is degraded more slowly than [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vasopressin, and requires less frequent administration. In addition, it has little effect on [[blood pressure]], while vasopressin may cause [[arterial hypertension]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008-08-01|title=Vasopressin and its role in critical care|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743181617304730|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care & Pain|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=134–137|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkn021|issn=1743-1816| vauthors = Sharman A, Low J |doi-access=free}}</ref> Vasopressin stimulates the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]], which indirectly increases responsiveness of alpha-1 receptor in blood vessel smooth muscle, increasing vessel tone and blood pressure.<ref name=":0" /> Several studies have shown that Desmopressin does not stimulate ACTH release (except in [[Cushing's Disease]]),<ref name="pmid12773117}">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pecori Giraldi F, Marini E, Torchiana E, Mortini P, Dubini A, Cavagnini F | title = Corticotrophin-releasing activity of desmopressin in Cushing's disease: lack of correlation between in vivo and in vitro responsiveness | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 177 | issue = 3 | pages = 373–379 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12773117 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1770373 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid9274696">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colombo P, Passini E, Re T, Faglia G, Ambrosi B | title = Effect of desmopressin on ACTH and cortisol secretion in states of ACTH excess | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 661–668 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9274696 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1997.1330954.x | s2cid = 23167207 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid8911861">{{cite journal | vauthors = Foppiani L, Sessarego P, Valenti S, Falivene MR, Cuttica CM, Giusti Disem M | title = Lack of effect of desmopressin on ACTH and cortisol responses to ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone in anorexia nervosa | journal = European Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 879–883 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8911861 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2362.1996.tb02133.x | s2cid = 34560015 }}</ref> and therefore does not directly raise blood pressure, however, one study showed that it stimulates ACTH release in over 50% of healthy subjects.<ref name="pmid10594528">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scott LV, Medbak S, Dinan TG | title = ACTH and cortisol release following intravenous desmopressin: a dose-response study | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 653–658 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10594528 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00850.x | s2cid = 27334220 }}</ref> Additionally, desmopressin is able to enhance ACTH and cortisol release in normal subjects following oCRH administration, but not in patients with [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name=pmid8911861 />

==Chemistry==
Desmopressin (''1-deamino-8-<small>D</small>-arginine vasopressin'') is a synthetic form of the normal human hormone [[vasopressin|arginine vasopressin]] (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH), a peptide containing nine amino acids.

Compared to vasopressin, desmopressin's first amino acid has been [[deamination|deaminated]], and the [[arginine]] at the eighth position is in the ''dextro'' rather than the ''levo'' form (see [[stereochemistry]]).
