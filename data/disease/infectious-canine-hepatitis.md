'''Infectious canine hepatitis''' (ICH) is an [[acute (medical)|acute]] [[hepatitis|liver infection]] in dogs caused by '''''Canine mastadenovirus A''''', formerly called ''Canine adenovirus 1'' (CAV-1).  Canine mastadenovirus A also causes disease in [[Gray Wolf|wolves]], [[coyote]]s, and [[bear]]s, and [[encephalitis]] in [[fox]]es.<ref name=Carter>{{cite web|author1=Carter, G.R. |author2=Wise, D.J. |year=2006|title=Adenoviridae|work=A Concise Review of Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap13/chapter.asp?LA=1|access-date=2006-06-10}}</ref>  The [[virus]] is spread in the feces, urine, blood, saliva, and nasal discharge of infected dogs.  It is contracted through the mouth or nose, where it replicates in the [[tonsil]]s.  The virus then infects the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s.  The [[incubation period]] is 4 to 9 days.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|date=1995|isbn=978-0-7216-6795-9}}</ref>

Symptoms include [[fever]], depression, loss of appetite, coughing, and a tender abdomen.  [[Cornea]]l [[edema]] and signs of liver disease, such as [[jaundice]], vomiting, and [[hepatic encephalopathy]], may also occur.  Severe cases will develop [[coagulation|bleeding]] disorders, which can cause [[hematoma]]s to form in the mouth.<ref name=Carter/>  Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease.  However, most dogs recover after a brief illness, although chronic corneal edema and kidney lesions may persist.<ref name=merck>{{cite web | title = Infectious Canine Hepatitis: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | date = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/57200.htm | access-date = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>

Diagnosis is made by recognizing the combination of symptoms and abnormal blood tests that occur in infectious canine hepatitis.  A rising [[serology|antibody titer]] to CAV-1 is also seen.  The disease can be confused with [[canine parvovirus]] because both will cause a low [[white blood cell]] count and bloody diarrhea in young, unvaccinated dogs.

Treatment is symptomatic.  Most dogs recover spontaneously without treatment.  Prevention is through [[vaccine|vaccination]] ([[ATCvet]] code {{ATCvet|I07|AA05}} and various combination vaccines).  Most combination [[vaccine]]s for dogs contain a modified canine adenovirus type-2.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = Richard B. | title = Canine Vaccination Protocols | work = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2614 | access-date = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  CAV-2 is one of the causes of respiratory infections in dogs, but it is similar enough to CAV-1 that vaccine for one creates [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] for both.  CAV-2 vaccine is much less likely to cause side effects than CAV-1 vaccine.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  One study has shown the vaccine to have a duration of immunity of at least four years.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abdelmagid O, Larson L, Payne L, Tubbs A, Wasmoen T, Schultz R |title=Evaluation of the efficacy and duration of immunity of a canine combination vaccine against virulent parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, and distemper virus experimental challenges |journal=Vet Ther |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=173â€“86 |year=2004 |pmid=15578450}}</ref>

CAV-1 is destroyed in the environment by steam cleaning and [[quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compound]]s.  Otherwise, the virus can survive in the environment for months in the right conditions.  It can also be released in the urine of a recovered dog for up to a year.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>
