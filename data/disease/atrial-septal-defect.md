'''Atrial septal defect''' ('''ASD''') is a [[congenital heart defect]] in which blood flows between the [[atrium (heart)|atria]] (upper chambers) of the [[heart]].  Some flow is a normal condition both pre-birth and immediately post-birth via the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]; however, when this does not naturally close after birth it is referred to as a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO). It is common in patients with a congenital [[interatrial septum|atrial septal]] [[aneurysm]] (ASA).

After PFO closure the atria normally are separated by a dividing wall, the [[interatrial septum]]. If this septum is defective or absent, then [[oxygen]]-rich blood can flow directly from the left side of the heart to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart; or the opposite, depending on whether the left or right atrium has the higher blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/atrial-septal-defect|title=Atrial Septal Defect Information |publisher=The Mount Sinai Hospital}}</ref> In the absence of other heart defects, the left atrium has the higher pressure. This can lead to lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small.  Also, in terms of health risks, people who have had a [[cryptogenic disease|cryptogenic]] [[stroke]] are more likely to have a PFO than the general population.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryptogenic-stroke |title = UpToDate}}</ref>

A cardiac [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] is the presence of a net flow of blood through a defect, either from left to right or right to left.  The amount of shunting present, if any, determines the hemodynamic significance of the ASD. A right-to-left-shunt results in venous blood entering the left side of the heart and into the arterial [[Circulatory system|circulation]] without passing through the [[pulmonary circulation]] to be [[oxygenate]]d. This may result in the clinical finding of [[cyanosis]], the presence of bluish-colored skin, especially of the lips and under the nails.

During development of the baby, the interatrial septum develops to separate the [[left atrium|left]] and [[right atrium|right atria]]. However, a hole in the septum called the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] allows blood from the right atrium to enter the left atrium during fetal development. This opening allows blood to bypass the nonfunctional fetal lungs while the fetus obtains its oxygen from the [[placenta]]. A layer of tissue called the septum primum acts as a valve over the foramen ovale during fetal development. After birth, the pressure in the right side of the heart drops as the lungs open and begin working, causing the foramen ovale to close entirely. In about 25% of adults,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins Basic Pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1416029731|pages=384|edition=8th}}</ref> the foramen ovale does not entirely seal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ostium Secundum Atrial Septal Defects|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/890991-overview|work=WebMD|publisher=Medscape|access-date=5 November 2012}}</ref> In these cases, any elevation of the pressure in the pulmonary circulatory system (due to [[pulmonary hypertension]], temporarily while [[cough]]ing, etc.) can cause the foramen ovale to remain open.

The six types of atrial septal defects are differentiated from each other by whether they involve other structures of the heart and how they are formed during the developmental process during early [[fetus|fetal]] development.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Ostium secundum===
The ''ostium secundum atrial septal defect'' is the most common type of atrial septal defect and comprises 6–10% of all congenital heart diseases.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
It involves a patent ostium secundum (that is, a patent [[foramen secundum]]).
The secundum atrial septal defect usually arises from an enlarged [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], inadequate growth of the [[septum secundum]], or excessive absorption of the [[septum primum]]. About 10 to 20% of individuals with ostium secundum ASDs also have [[mitral valve prolapse]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leachman R, Cokkinos D, Cooley D | title = Association of ostium secundum atrial septal defects with mitral valve prolapse | journal = Am J Cardiol | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–169 | year = 1976 | pmid = 952260 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9149(76)90144-2}}</ref>

An ostium secundum ASD accompanied by an acquired [[mitral valve stenosis]] is called [[Lutembacher's syndrome]].<ref name=Cecil_400>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|pp=400–401}}</ref>

====Natural history====
Most individuals with an uncorrected secundum ASD do not have significant symptoms through early adulthood.  More than 70% develop symptoms by about 40 years of age.  Symptoms are typically decreased exercise tolerance, easy fatigability, [[palpitation]]s, and [[fainting|syncope]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Complications of an uncorrected secundum ASD include [[pulmonary hypertension]], right-sided [[congestive heart failure]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

While pulmonary hypertension is unusual before 20 years of age, it is seen in 50% of individuals above the age of 40.  Progression to [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]] occurs in 5 to 10% of individuals late in the disease process.<ref name=Cecil_400 />

===Patent foramen ovale===
[[File:Patent-foramen-ovale-en.png|thumb|Patent foramen ovale]]
A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant opening of the fetal [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which often closes after a person's birth. This remnant opening is caused by the incomplete fusion of the septum primum and the septum secundum; in healthy hearts, this fusion form the fossa ovalis, a portion of the interatrial septum which corresponds to the location of the foramen ovale in the fetus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Oduah |first=Mary-Tiffany A. |title=Anatomy, Thorax, Heart Fossa Ovalis |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538432/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-11-15 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30860703 |last2=Sharma |first2=Piyush |last3=Brown |first3=Kristen N.}}</ref> In medical use, the term "patent" means open or unobstructed.<ref>{{cite web | title = patent | work = Medical Dictionary | publisher = [[TheFreeDictionary.com]]   | date = September 1, 2014 | url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/patent  | access-date = 2015-03-26 }}</ref> In about 25% of people, the foramen ovale does not close, leaving them with a PFO or at least with what some physicians classify as a "pro-PFO", which is a PFO that is normally closed, but can open under increased right atrial pressure. On echocardiography, shunting of blood  may not be noted except when the patient coughs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

PFO is linked to [[stroke]], [[sleep apnea]], [[migraine]] with [[aura (symptom)|aura]], cluster headache, [[decompression sickness]], Raynaud's phenomenon, hyperventilation syndrome, transient global amnesia (TGA), and '''leftsided''' carcinoid heartdisease (mitral valve). No cause is established for a foramen ovale to remain open instead of closing, but heredity and genetics may play a role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/patent-foramen-ovale/symptoms-and-causes|title=Patent Foramen Ovale Symptoms & Causes |publisher=Boston Children's Hospital|access-date=2016-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723141208/http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/patent-foramen-ovale/symptoms-and-causes|archive-date=2016-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasheart.org/HIC/Topics/Cond/pfo.cfm|title=Patent Foramen Ovale |publisher=Texas Heart Institute Heart Information Center}}</ref> In rats research showed a link to the amount of Cryptosporidium infestation and the number of newborn rats that failed to close their foramen ovale. PFO is not treated in the absence of other symptoms.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The mechanism by which a PFO may play a role in stroke is called [[paradoxical embolism]].  In the case of PFO, a blood clot from the venous circulatory system is able to pass from the right atrium directly into the left atrium via the PFO, rather than being filtered by the lungs, and thereupon into systemic circulation toward the brain.<ref name="Patent Foramen Ovale PFO">{{Cite web|url=https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/congenital-heart-defects/about-congenital-heart-defects/patent-foramen-ovale-pfo|title=Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)|website=www.heart.org}}</ref><ref name="Furlan 2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Furlan AJ, Reisman M, Massaro J, Mauri L, Adams H, Albers GW, Felberg R, Herrmann H, Kar S, Landzberg M, Raizner A, Wechsler L |title=Closure or medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke with patent foramen ovale |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=366 |issue=11 |pages=991–999 |year=2012 |pmid=22417252 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1009639 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Also multiple substances -including the prothrombotic agent serotonin- are shunted bypassing the lungs.

===Ostium primum===
{{Main|Ostium primum atrial septal defect}}
A defect in the [[ostium primum]] is occasionally classified as an atrial septal defect,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/atrial-septal-defect/types.html |title=Atrial Septal Defect Types  |website=[[Mayo Clinic]] |access-date=2007-10-14 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010431/http://www.mayoclinic.org/atrial-septal-defect/types.html| archive-date= 28 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> but it is more commonly classified as an [[atrioventricular septal defect]].<ref name="isbn0-683-30272-8">{{cite book |author1=Fix, James D. |author2=Dudek, Ronald W. |title=Embryology |url=https://archive.org/details/embryology0002eddude |url-access=registration |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/embryology0002eddude/page/52 52] |isbn=978-0-683-30272-1 }}</ref><ref>{{ICD10|Q|21|2|q|20}}</ref> Ostium primum defects are less common than ostium secundum defects.<ref name=FAstep2>{{cite book|last=Skelley|first=Tao Le, Vikas Bhushan, Nathan William|title=First aid for the USMLE step 2 CK|publisher=McGraw–Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-176137-6|pages=357|edition=8th|year=2012}}</ref> This type of defect is usually associated with [[Down syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Endocardial Cushion Defect Information |url=https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/endocardial-cushion-defect |website=The Mount Sinai Hospital}}</ref>

===Sinus venosus===
A sinus venosus ASD is a type of atrial septum defect in which the defect involves the venous inflow of either the [[superior vena cava]] or the [[inferior vena cava]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

A sinus venosus ASD that involves the superior vena cava makes up 2 to 3% of all interatrial communication.  It is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.  It is frequently associated with anomalous drainage of the right-sided [[pulmonary vein]]s into the right atrium (instead of the normal drainage of the pulmonary veins into the left atrium).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Davia J, Cheitlin M, Bedynek J | title = Sinus venosus atrial septal defect: analysis of fifty cases | journal = Am Heart J | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–185 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4569755 | doi = 10.1016/0002-8703(73)90458-4}}</ref>

ASD secundum seen as a discontinuation of the white band of the atrial septum. The enlarged right atrium is below. The enlarged pulmonary veins are seen entering the left atrium above.]]

===Common or single atrium===
Common (or single) atrium is a failure of development of the embryologic components that contribute to the atrial septal complex. It is frequently associated with [[heterotaxy syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Valdes-Cruz, L. M. |author2=Cayre, R. O. | title=Echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital heart disease | location=Philadelphia | year=1998}}</ref>

=== Mixed ===
The interatrial septum can be divided into five septal zones. If the defect involves two or more of the septal zones, then the defect is termed a mixed atrial septal defect.<ref name=test>{{cite journal|last=John|first=J|author2=Abrol, S|author3= Sadiq, A|author4= Shani, J|title=Mixed atrial septal defect coexisting ostium secundum and sinus venosus atrial septal defect.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=Jul 26, 2011|volume=58|issue=5|pages=e9|pmid=21777739|url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/58/5/e9|access-date=17 June 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2010.11.077|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Presentation==
===Complications===
Due to the communication between the atria that occurs in ASDs, disease entities or complications from the condition are possible. Patients with an uncorrected atrial septal defect may be at increased risk for developing a cardiac arrhythmia, as well as more frequent respiratory infections.<ref name=FAstep2 />

====Decompression sickness====
ASDs, and particularly PFOs, are a predisposing venous blood carrying inert gases, such as [[helium]] or [[nitrogen]] does not pass through the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lier H, Schroeder S, Hering R |title=Patent foramen ovale: an underrated risk for divers? |journal=Dtsch Med Wochenschr |volume=129 |issue=1–2 |pages=27–30 |year=2004 |pmid=14703578 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-812652|s2cid=260108807 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Saary M, Gray G | title = A review of the relationship between patent foramen ovale and type II decompression sickness | journal = Aviat Space Environ Med | volume = 72 | issue = 12 |pages=1113–1120 |year=2001 |pmid=11763113}}</ref>
The only way to release the excess inert gases from the body is to pass the blood carrying the inert gases through the lungs to be exhaled. If some of the inert gas-laden blood passes through the PFO, it avoids the lungs and the inert gas is more likely to form large bubbles in the arterial blood stream causing decompression sickness.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====Eisenmenger's syndrome====
{{main|Eisenmenger's syndrome}}
If a net flow of blood exists from the left atrium to the right atrium, called a left-to-right shunt, then an increase in the blood flow through the lungs happens.  Initially, this increased blood flow is asymptomatic, but if it persists, the pulmonary blood vessels may stiffen, causing pulmonary hypertension, which increases the pressures in the right side of the heart, leading to the reversal of the shunt into a right-to-left shunt.  Reversal of the shunt occurs, and the blood  flowing in the opposite direction through the ASD is called Eisenmenger's syndrome, a rare and late complication of an ASD.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====Paradoxical embolus====
Venous [[thrombus]] (clots in the veins) are quite common.  Embolizations (dislodgement of thrombi) normally go to the lung and cause [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]].  In an individual with ASD, these emboli can potentially enter the arterial system, which can cause any phenomenon attributed to acute loss of blood to a portion of the body, including [[cerebrovascular accident]] (stroke), infarction of the [[spleen]] or [[intestine]]s, or even a distal extremity (i.e., finger or toe).{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

This is known as a paradoxical embolus because the clot material paradoxically enters the arterial system instead of going to the lungs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====Migraine====
{{Main|Migraine surgery#Patent foramen ovale closure}}
Some recent research has suggested that a proportion of cases of migraine may be caused by PFO. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, closure of a PFO can reduce symptoms in certain cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams H | title = Patent foramen ovale: paradoxical embolism and paradoxical data | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–20 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14708944 | doi = 10.4065/79.1.15| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Azarbal B, Tobis J, Suh W, Chan V, Dao C, Gaster R | title = Association of interatrial shunts and migraine headaches: impact of transcatheter closure | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 489–492 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15708691 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.075| doi-access = free }}</ref> This remains controversial;  20% of the general population has a PFO, which for the most part, is asymptomatic.  About 20% of the female population has migraines, and  the [[placebo effect]] in migraine typically averages around 40%.  The high frequency of these facts make finding statistically significant relationships between PFO and migraine difficult (i.e., the relationship may just be chance or coincidence). In a large [[randomized controlled trial]], the higher prevalence of PFO in migraine patients was confirmed, but migraine headache cessation was not more prevalent in the group of migraine patients who underwent closure of their PFOs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dowson|first=Andrew |author2=Mullen, MJ |author3=Peatfield, R |author4=Muir, K |author5=Khan, AA |author6=Wells, C |author7=Lipscombe, SL |author8=Rees, T |author9=De Giovanni, JV |author10=Morrison, WL |author11=Hildick-Smith, D |author12=Elrington, G |author13=Hillis, WS |author14=Malik, IS |author15=Rickards, A |title=Migraine Intervention With STARFlex Technology (MIST) trial: a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of patent foramen ovale closure with STARFlex septal repair implant to resolve refractory migraine headache|journal=Circulation|date=18 March 2008|volume=117|issue=11|pages=1397–1404|pmid=18316488|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/117/11/1397.full|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.727271|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Mechanisms==

In unaffected individuals, the chambers of the left side of the heart are under higher pressure than the chambers of the right side because the left ventricle has to produce enough pressure to pump blood throughout the entire body, while the right ventricle needs only to produce enough pressure to pump blood to the [[lung]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In the case of a large ASD (> 9&nbsp;mm), which may result in a clinically remarkable left-to-right [[Cardiac shunt|shunt]], blood  shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium.  This extra blood from the left atrium may cause a volume overload of both the right atrium and the right ventricle.  If untreated, this condition can result in enlargement of the right side of the heart and ultimately heart failure.<ref name="test" />

Any process that increases the pressure in the left ventricle can cause worsening of the left-to-right shunt.  This includes hypertension, which increases the pressure that the left ventricle has to generate to open the aortic valve during ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]], and [[coronary artery disease]] which increases the stiffness of the left ventricle, thereby increasing the filling pressure of the left ventricle during ventricular [[diastole]].  The left-to-right shunt increases the filling pressure of the right heart ([[Preload (cardiology)|preload]]) and forces the right ventricle to pump out more blood than the left ventricle.  This constant overloading of the right side of the heart causes an overload of the entire pulmonary vasculature.  Eventually, [[pulmonary hypertension]] may develop.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The pulmonary hypertension will cause the right ventricle to face increased [[afterload]].  The right ventricle is forced to generate higher pressures to try to overcome the pulmonary hypertension.  This may lead to [[ventricular failure|right ventricular failure]] (dilatation and decreased systolic function of the right ventricle).{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If the ASD is left uncorrected, the pulmonary hypertension progresses and the pressure in the right side of the heart becomes greater than the left side of the heart.  This reversal of the pressure gradient across the ASD causes the shunt to reverse – a right-to-left shunt.  This phenomenon is known as [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]].  Once right-to-left shunting occurs, a portion of the oxygen-poor blood gets shunted to the left side of the heart and ejected to the peripheral vascular system.  This causes signs of [[cyanosis]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Diagnosis==
[[File:ASD Chest X-Ray.jpg|thumb|Abnormal chest X-ray as seen in a patient of atrial septal defect]]

Most individuals with a significant ASD are diagnosed ''[[Uterus|in utero]]'' or in early childhood with the use of [[ultrasonography]] or [[auscultation]] of the [[heart sounds]] during [[physical examination]]. Some individuals with an ASD  have surgical correction of their ASD during childhood.  The development of signs and symptoms due to an ASD are related to the size of the intracardiac shunt. Individuals with a larger shunt tend to present with symptoms at a younger age.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Adults with an uncorrected ASD present with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion (shortness of breath with minimal exercise), [[congestive heart failure]], or [[cerebrovascular accident]] (stroke).  They may be noted on routine testing to have an abnormal [[chest X-ray]] or an abnormal [[ECG]] and may have [[atrial fibrillation]].  If the ASD causes a left-to-right shunt, the pulmonary vasculature in both lungs may appear dilated on chest X-ray, due to the increase in pulmonary blood flow.<ref name=Cecil_270>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|p=270}}</ref>

===Physical examination===

The [[Physical examination|physical findings]] in an adult with an ASD include those related directly to the intracardiac shunt and those that are secondary to the [[congestive heart failure|right heart failure]] that may be present in these individuals.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In unaffected individuals, respiratory variations occur in the [[Split S2|splitting of the second heart sound]] (S<sub>2</sub>).  During respiratory inspiration, the negative intrathoracic pressure causes increased blood return into the right side of the heart.  The increased blood volume in the right ventricle causes the pulmonic valve to stay open longer during ventricular systole.  This causes a normal delay in the P<sub>2</sub> component of S<sub>2</sub>.  During expiration, the positive intrathoracic pressure causes decreased blood return to the right side of the heart.  The reduced volume in the right ventricle allows the pulmonic valve to close earlier at the end of ventricular systole, causing P<sub>2</sub> to occur earlier.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In individuals with an ASD,  a fixed splitting of S<sub>2</sub> occurs because the extra blood return during inspiration gets equalized between the left and right atria due to the communication that exists between the atria in individuals with ASD.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The right ventricle can be thought of as continuously overloaded because of the left-to-right shunt, producing a widely split S2. Because the atria are linked via the atrial septal defect, inspiration produces no net pressure change between them, and has no effect on the splitting of S2. Thus, S2 is split to the same degree during inspiration as expiration, and is said to be "fixed".{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Echocardiography===

In transthoracic [[echocardiography]], an atrial septal defect may be seen on color flow imaging as a jet of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If agitated saline is injected into a peripheral vein during echocardiography, small air bubbles can be seen on echocardiographic imaging.  Bubbles traveling across an ASD may be seen either at rest or during a cough. (Bubbles  only flow from right atrium to left atrium if the right atrial pressure is greater than left atrial). Because better visualization of the atria is achieved with transesophageal echocardiography, this test may be performed in individuals with a suspected ASD which is not visualized on transthoracic imaging.
Newer techniques to visualize these defects involve intracardiac imaging with special catheters typically placed in the venous system and advanced to the level of the heart.  This type of imaging is becoming more common and involves only mild sedation for the patient typically.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If the individual has adequate echocardiographic windows, use of the echocardiogram to measure the cardiac output of the left ventricle and the right ventricle independently is possible.  In this way,  the shunt fraction can be estimated using echocardiography.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Transcranial doppler bubble study===

A less invasive method for detecting a PFO or other ASDs than transesophagal ultrasound is [[transcranial Doppler]] with bubble contrast.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Glen |first=S. |author2=J. Douglas. |title=Transcranial doppler monitoring. (letter to editor) |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=25 |issue=2 |year=1995 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6409 |access-date=2008-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426165804/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/6409 |archive-date=2012-04-26 |url-status=usurped }}</ref>  This method reveals the cerebral impact of the ASD or PFO.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Electrocardiogram===

The ECG findings in atrial septal defect vary with the type of defect the individual has. Individuals with atrial septal defects may have a prolonged PR interval (a [[first-degree heart block]]).  The prolongation of the PR interval is probably due to the enlargement of the atria common in ASDs and the increased distance due to the defect itself.  Both of these can cause an increased distance of internodal conduction from the [[SA node]] to the [[AV node]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark E, Kugler J | title = Preoperative secundum atrial septal defect with coexisting sinus node and atrioventricular node dysfunction | journal = Circulation | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 976–980 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7074763 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.65.5.976| doi-access = free }}</ref>

In addition to the PR prolongation, individuals with a primum ASD have a left axis deviation of the QRS complex, while those with a secundum ASD have a right axis deviation of the QRS complex.  Individuals with a sinus venosus ASD exhibit a left axis deviation of the P wave (not the QRS complex).{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

A common finding in the ECG is the presence of incomplete [[right bundle branch block]], which is so characteristic that if it is absent, the diagnosis of ASD should be reconsidered.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In those where a comprehensive evaluation is performed and an obvious etiology is not identified, they are defined as having a cryptogenic stroke.

==== PFO closure ====
[[File:Amplatzer Septal Occluder 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Amplatzer Septal Occluder is a device specifically designed to close an ASD]]
Until recently, patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke were treated with antiplatelet therapy only. Previous studies did not identify a clear benefit of PFO closure over antiplatelet therapy in reducing recurrent ischemic stroke. However, based on new evidence <ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mas|first1=Jean-Louis|last2=Derumeaux|first2=Geneviève|last3=Guillon|first3=Benoît|last4=Massardier|first4=Evelyne|last5=Hosseini|first5=Hassan|last6=Mechtouff|first6=Laura|last7=Arquizan|first7=Caroline|last8=Béjot|first8=Yannick|last9=Vuillier|first9=Fabrice|date=2017-09-14|title=Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Anticoagulation vs. Antiplatelets after Stroke|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=377|issue=11|pages=1011–1021|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1705915|pmid=28902593|issn=0028-4793|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Søndergaard|first1=Lars|last2=Kasner|first2=Scott E.|last3=Rhodes|first3=John F.|last4=Andersen|first4=Grethe|last5=Iversen|first5=Helle K.|last6=Nielsen-Kudsk|first6=Jens E.|last7=Settergren|first7=Magnus|last8=Sjöstrand|first8=Christina|last9=Roine|first9=Risto O.|date=2017-09-14|title=Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Antiplatelet Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=377|issue=11|pages=1033–1042|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1707404|pmid=28902580|issn=0028-4793|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Saver|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Carroll|first2=John D.|last3=Thaler|first3=David E.|last4=Smalling|first4=Richard W.|last5=MacDonald|first5=Lee A.|last6=Marks|first6=David S.|last7=Tirschwell|first7=David L.|date=2017-09-14|title=Long-Term Outcomes of Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Medical Therapy after Stroke|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=377|issue=11|pages=1022–1032|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1610057|pmid=28902590|s2cid=3425515|issn=0028-4793|doi-access=free}}</ref> and systematic review in the field,<ref name="Mir e023761"/> percutaneous PFO closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy is suggested for all who meet all the following criteria:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kuijpers|first1=Ton|last2=Spencer|first2=Frederick A|last3=Siemieniuk|first3=Reed A C|last4=Vandvik|first4=Per O|last5=Otto|first5=Catherine M|last6=Lytvyn|first6=Lyubov|last7=Mir|first7=Hassan|last8=Jin|first8=Albert Y|last9=Manja|first9=Veena|date=25 July 2018|title=Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke?

==== Medical therapy ====
Based on the most up to date evidence, PFO closure is more effective at reducing recurrent ischemic stroke when compared to medical therapy. In most of these studies, antiplatelet and anticoagulation were combined in the medical therapy arm. Although there is limited data on the effectiveness of anticoagulation in reducing stroke in this population, it is hypothesized that based on the embolic mechanism, that anticoagulation should be superior to antiplatelet therapy at reducing risk of recurrent stroke. A recent review of the literature supports this hypothesis recommending anticoagulation over the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke.<ref name="Mir e023761"/> However, more evidence is required comparing of PFO closure with anticoagulation or anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Atrial septal defect ===
Once someone is found to have an atrial septal defect, a determination of whether it should be corrected is typically made. If the atrial septal defect is causing the right ventricle to enlarge a secundum atrial septal defect should generally be closed.<ref name="Ku2015">{{cite journal|last1=Kuijpers|first1=JM|last2=Mulder|first2=BJ|last3=Bouma|first3=BJ|date=April 2015|title=Secundum atrial septal defect in adults: a practical review and recent developments|journal=Netherlands Heart Journal|volume=23|issue=4|pages=205–211|doi=10.1007/s12471-015-0663-z|pmc=4368528|pmid=25884091}}</ref> If the ASD is not causing problems the defect may simply be checked every two or three years.<ref name="Ku2015" /> Methods of closure of an ASD include surgical closure and percutaneous closure.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

====Evaluation prior to correction====
Prior to correction of an ASD, an evaluation is made of the severity of the individual's pulmonary hypertension (if present at all) and whether it is reversible (closure of an ASD may be recommended for prevention purposes, to avoid such a complication in the first place. Pulmonary hypertension is not always present in adults who are diagnosed with an ASD in adulthood).{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If pulmonary hypertension is present, the evaluation may include a right heart catheterization. This involves placing a catheter in the venous system of the heart and measuring pressures and oxygen saturations in the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery, and in the wedge position.  Individuals with a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)  less than 7 wood units show regression of symptoms (including [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA functional class]]).  However, individuals with a PVR greater than 15 wood units have increased mortality associated with closure of the ASD.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

If the pulmonary arterial pressure is more than two-thirds of the systemic systolic pressure,  a net left-to-right shunt should occur at least 1.5:1 or evidence of reversibility of the shunt when given pulmonary artery vasodilators prior to surgery.  (If Eisenmenger's physiology has set in, the right-to-left shunt must be shown to be reversible with pulmonary artery vasodilators prior to surgery.){{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Surgical mortality due to closure of an ASD is lowest when the procedure is performed prior to the development of significant pulmonary hypertension.  The lowest mortality rates are achieved in individuals with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure less than 40 mmHg. If [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]] has occurred, a significant risk of mortality exists regardless of the method of closure of the ASD. In individuals who have developed Eisenmenger's syndrome, the pressure in the right ventricle has raised high enough to reverse the shunt in the atria.  If the ASD is then closed, the [[afterload]] that the right ventricle has to act against has suddenly increased.  This may cause immediate right ventricular failure, since it may not be able to pump the blood against the pulmonary hypertension.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====Surgical closure====
[[File:Blausen 0070 AtrialSeptalDefect PatchClosure.png|thumb|left|Illustration depicting surgical patch closure of ASD]]

Surgical closure of an ASD involves opening up at least one atrium and closing the defect with a patch under direct visualization.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====Catheter procedure====
[[File:Blausen 0070 AtrialSeptalDefect DeviceClosure.png|thumb|Illustration depicting surgical device closure of ASD]]
Percutaneous device closure involves the passage of a catheter into the heart through the femoral vein guided by fluoroscopy and echocardiography.<ref name="Freixa 2014" />  An example of a percutaneous device is a device which has discs that can expand to a variety of diameters at the end of the catheter. The catheter is placed in the right femoral vein and guided into the right atrium. The catheter is guided through the atrial septal wall and one disc (left atrial) is opened and pulled into place. Once this occurs, the other disc (right atrial) is opened in place and the device is inserted into the septal wall. This type of PFO closure is more effective than drug or other medical therapies for decreasing the risk of future thromboembolism.<ref name="Freixa 2014" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Rahman|last2=Nayyar|first2=Mannu|last3=Jovin|first3=Ion S.|last4=Rashid|first4=Abdul|last5=Bondy|first5=Beatrix R.|last6=Fan|first6=Tai-Hwang M.|last7=Flaherty|first7=Michael P.|last8=Rao|first8=Sunil V.|title=Device Closure Versus Medical Therapy Alone for Patent Foramen Ovale in Patients With Cryptogenic Stroke|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=168|issue=5|pages=335–342|date=9 January 2018|doi=10.7326/M17-2679|pmid=29310136|s2cid=3679132}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Rosa|first1=Salvatore|last2=Sievert|first2=Horst|last3=Sabatino|first3=Jolanda|last4=Polimeni|first4=Alberto|last5=Sorrentino|first5=Sabato|last6=Indolfi|first6=Ciro|title=Percutaneous Closure Versus Medical Treatment in Stroke Patients With Patent Foramen Ovale|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=168|issue=5|pages=343–350|date=9 January 2018|doi=10.7326/M17-3033|pmid=29310133|s2cid=3725081}}</ref>

Percutaneous closure of an ASD is currently only indicated for the closure of secundum ASDs with a sufficient rim of tissue around the septal defect so that the closure device does not impinge upon the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or the [[tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] or [[mitral valve|mitral]] valves.  The [[Kurt Amplatz|Amplatzer]] Septal Occluder (ASO) is commonly used to close ASDs.  The ASO consists of two self-expandable round discs connected to each other with a 4-mm waist, made up of 0.004– to 0.005-inch Nitinol wire mesh filled with Dacron fabric. Implantation of the device is relatively easy. The prevalence of residual defect is low. The disadvantages are a thick profile of the device and concern related to a large amount of nitinol (a nickel-titanium compound) in the device and consequent potential for nickel toxicity.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Epidemiology==
As a group, atrial septal defects are detected in one child per 1500 live births. PFOs are quite common (appearing in 10–20% of adults), but when asymptomatic go undiagnosed. ASDs make up 30 to 40% of all congenital heart diseases that are seen in adults.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaplan S | title = Congenital heart disease in adolescents and adults. Natural and postoperative history across age groups | journal = Cardiol Clin | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–556 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8252558| doi = 10.1016/S0733-8651(18)30137-1 }}</ref>

The ostium secundum atrial septal defect accounts for 7% of all congenital heart lesions.  This lesion shows a male:female ratio of 1:2.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Feldt R, Avasthey P, Yoshimasu F, Kurland L, Titus J | title = Incidence of congenital heart disease in children born to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1950–1969 | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 46 | issue = 12 | pages = 794–799 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5128021}}</ref>
