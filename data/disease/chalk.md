'''Chalk''' is a soft, white, [[permeability (Earth sciences)|porous]], [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[carbonate rock]]. It is a form of [[limestone]] composed of the mineral [[calcite]] and originally formed deep under the sea by the compression of microscopic [[plankton]] that had settled to the [[sea floor]]. Chalk is common throughout [[Western Europe]], where deposits underlie parts of France, and steep cliffs are often seen where they meet the sea in places such as the [[Dover cliffs]] on the [[Kent]] coast of the [[English Channel]].

Chalk is mined for use in industry, such as for [[quicklime]], [[brick]]s and builder's [[putty]], and in [[agriculture]], for raising [[pH]] in soils with high [[acidity]]. It is also used for "[[Blackboard|blackboard chalk]]" for writing and drawing on various types of surfaces, although these can also be manufactured from other carbonate-based minerals, or [[gypsum]].

Chalk is typically almost pure calcite, {{chem2|CaCO3}}, with just 2% to 4% of other minerals. These are usually [[quartz]] and [[clay mineral]]s, though collophane (cryptocrystalline [[apatite]], a [[phosphate]] mineral) is also sometimes present, as nodules or as small pellets interpreted as fecal pellets. In some chalk beds, the calcite has been converted to [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], {{chem2|CaMg(CO3)2}}, and in a few cases the dolomitized chalk has been dedolomitized back to calcite.<ref name="hancock-1975"/>

Chalk is highly porous, with typical values of porosity ranging from 35 to 47 per cent.<ref name="hancock-1975"/> While it is similar in appearance to both [[gypsum]] and [[diatomite]], chalk is identifiable by its hardness, [[fossil]] content, and its reaction to [[acid]] (it produces [[effervescence]] on contact).<ref name=geology/>

==Formation==
In Western Europe, chalk was formed in the Late [[Cretaceous]] Epoch and the early [[Palaeocene]] Epoch (between 100 and 61 million years ago).<ref name=chalkeast>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/chalk.htm|archive-date=3 June 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120603234302/http://www.geo-east.org.uk/special_projects/chalk.htm|title=Introducing the Chalk|website=Chalk East}}</ref><ref name="VanDerVoert_etal_2018">{{cite journal | title=Geological evolution of the Chalk Group in the northern Dutch North Sea: inversion, sedimentation and redeposition | first1=E. | last1=Van Der Voert | first2=L. | last2=Heijnen | first3=J.J.G. | last3=Reijmer | journal=[[Geological Magazine]] | year=2019 | volume=156 | issue=7 | pages=1265–1284 | doi=10.1017/S0016756818000572| bibcode=2019GeoM..156.1265V | hdl=1871.1/76ca3535-823f-483f-9a38-cb070ab65e32 | s2cid=134798076 | url=https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/76ca3535-823f-483f-9a38-cb070ab65e32 | hdl-access=free }}</ref> It was deposited on extensive [[continental shelves]] at depths between {{convert|100 and 600|m||}}, during a time of nonseasonal (likely arid) climate that reduced the amount of erosion from nearby exposed rock. The lack of nearby erosion explains the high purity of chalk. The coccolithophores, foraminifera, and other microscopic organisms from which the chalk came mostly form low-magnesium calcite skeletons, so the sediments were already in the form of highly stable low-magnesium calcite when deposited. This is in contrast with most other limestones, which formed from high-magnesium calcite or aragonite that rapidly converted to the more stable low-magnesium calcite after deposition, resulting in the early [[Cementation (geology)|cementation]] of such limestones. In chalk, absence of this calcium carbonate conversion process prevented early cementation, which partially accounts for chalk's high porosity.<ref name="hancock-1975"/> Chalk is also the only form of limestone that commonly shows signs of compaction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blatt |first1=Harvey |last2=Middleton |first2=Gerard |last3=Murray |first3=Raymond |title=Origin of sedimentary rocks |date=1980 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn=0136427103 |edition=2d |page=508}}</ref>

[[Flint]] (a type of [[chert]]) is very common as bands parallel to the [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] or as [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s in [[seam (geology)|seams]], or linings to [[fracture (geology)|fractures]], embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from [[Spicule (sponge)|sponge spicule]]s<ref name=craven/>  or other [[Silica|siliceous]] organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger [[fossil]]s such as [[Echinoidea]] which may be [[Silicification|silicified]] (i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint).{{sfn|Blatt|Middleton|Murray|1980|p=576}}

==Geology and geographic distribution==
[[File:Chalk ("Upper Chalk" Formation, Upper Cretaceous; White Cliffs of Dover, England, southern Britain).jpg|thumb|Chalk from the White Cliffs of Dover, England]]
Chalk is so common in Cretaceous marine beds that the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] was named for these deposits. The name Cretaceous was derived from [[Latin]] ''creta'', meaning ''chalk''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Glossary of Geology|publisher=American Geological Institute|edition=3rd|page= 165|year=1972|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> Some deposits of chalk were formed after the Cretaceous.<ref name="Mesaoria2018"/>

The [[Chalk Group]] is a [[Europe]]an stratigraphic unit deposited during the late [[Cretaceous]] Period. It forms the famous [[White Cliffs of Dover]] in [[Kent]], England, as well as their counterparts of the [[Cap Blanc Nez]] on the other side of the [[Dover Strait]]. The [[Champagne region]] of France is mostly underlain by chalk deposits, which contain artificial caves used for [[wine storage]].<ref name="hancock-1975"/> Some of the highest chalk cliffs in the world occur at [[Jasmund National Park]] in [[Germany]] and at [[Møns Klint]] in [[Denmark]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Prothero |first1=Donald R. |title=The Story of the Earth in 25 Rocks: Tales of Important Geological Puzzles and the People Who Solved Them |date=9 July 2018 |doi=10.7312/prot18260-021}}</ref>

==Mining==
{{Main|Chalk mining}}
Chalk is [[chalk mining|mined]] from chalk deposits both above ground and [[underground mining (hard rock)|underground]]. Chalk mining boomed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], due to the need for chalk products such as [[quicklime]] and [[brick]]s.<ref name=mines>{{cite web|title=Chalk Mines {{!}} KURG|url=https://www.kurg.org.uk/chalk-mines/|website=www.kurg.org.uk|accessdate=27 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035728/https://www.kurg.org.uk/chalk-mines/|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Most people first encounter chalk in school where it refers to [[Blackboard|blackboard chalk]], which was originally made of mineral chalk, since it readily crumbles and leaves particles that stick loosely to rough surfaces, allowing it to make writing that can be readily erased.   Blackboard chalk manufacturers now may use mineral chalk, other [[limestone|mineral sources]] of calcium carbonate, or the mineral [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]).  While gypsum-based blackboard chalk is the lowest cost to produce, and thus widely used in the [[developing world]], use of carbonate-based chalk produces larger particles and thus less dust, and it is marketed as "dustless chalk".<ref>Thakker, M., Shukla, P. and Shah, D.O., 2015.

Chalk was traditionally used in recreation. In field sports, such as tennis played on grass, powdered chalk was used to mark the boundary lines of the playing field or court.
