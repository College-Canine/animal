It separates the heart from interference of other structures, protects it against [[infection]] and [[blunt trauma]], and [[lubricate]]s the heart's movements.

The English name originates from the [[Ancient Greek]] prefix ''peri-'' (περί) 'around' and the suffix ''-cardion'' (κάρδιον) 'heart'.

==Anatomy==
The pericardium is a tough fibroelastic sac which covers the heart from all sides except at the cardiac root (where the [[great vessels]] join the heart) and the bottom (where only the serous pericardium exists to cover the upper surface of the [[central tendon of diaphragm|central tendon]] of [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dorland's|title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=1412|edition=32nd}}</ref>  The fibrous pericardium is semi-rigid, while the serous pericardium is quite pliable.

The same mesothelium that constitutes the serous pericardium also covers the heart as the [[epicardium]], resulting in a continuous [[serous membrane]] [[invaginate]]d onto itself as two opposing surfaces (over the fibrous pericardium and over the heart).  This creates a pouch-like [[potential space]] around the heart enclosed between the two opposing serosal surfaces, known as the '''pericardial space''' or '''pericardial cavity''', which is filled with a small amount of [[serous fluid]] to lubricate the heart's movements and cushions it from any external jerk or shock.

===Fibrous===
The '''fibrous pericardium''' is the outside layer of the pericardium, made up of [[dense connective tissue|dense]] and [[loose connective tissue]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tortora |first1=Gerard J. |last2=Nielsen |first2=Mark T. |year=2009 |title=Principles of Human Anatomy |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesanatom00tort_679 |url-access=limited |edition=11th |pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesanatom00tort_679/page/n111 84]–5 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-78931-4}}</ref>  While capable of some [[deformation (engineering)|change in shape]], it is largely non-pliable, which acts to protect the heart against blunt forces and sudden pressure change from the outside.  It is continuous with the [[adventitia externa|outer adventitial layer]] of the neighboring [[Great vessels|great blood vessels]], fused with the central fibrous area of the diaphragm on its posterior aspect<ref>{{Citation|last1=Rehman|first1=Ibraheem|title=Anatomy, Thorax, Pericardium|date=2021|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482256/|work=StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29489245|access-date=2021-09-12|last2=Nassereddin|first2=Ali|last3=Rehman|first3=Afzal}}</ref> and attached to the posterior surface of the [[sternum]] by the sternopericardial ligaments.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winieski |first1=Lawrence E. |title=Snell's Clinical Anatomy By Regions |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |pages=241}}</ref>

===Serous===
The '''serous pericardium''', in turn, is divided into two parts:
*The ''parietal serous pericardium'', which lines the interior side of the superficial portion of the pericardial sac, is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium
*The ''visceral serous pericardium'', also known as the '''epicardium''', covers the [[myocardium]] of the heart<ref name=Laizzo2009pp125-8/> and can be considered its [[serosa]].  It is largely made of a mesothelium overlying some [[elastin]]-rich [[loose connective tissue]].  During ventricular contraction, the wave of [[depolarization]] moves from the [[endocardial]] to the epicardial surface.
Both of these layers function in lubricating the heart to prevent friction during heart activity.

The visceral serous pericardium extends to the root of the [[great vessels]] and joins the parietal serous pericardium at the anatomical base of the heart. This junction occurs at two areas: the [[ventricular outflow tract]]s where the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary trunk]] leave the heart, and the inflow tracts where the [[superior vena cava|superior]]/[[inferior vena cava]] and [[pulmonary vein]]s enter the heart.<ref name=Laizzo2009pp125-8>{{cite book |last=Laizzo |first=P.A. |title=Handbook of Cardiac Anatomy, Physiology, and Devices |isbn=978-1-60327-371-8 |edition=2nd |year=2009 |publisher=Humana Press |pages=125–8}}</ref>  The root of the great vessels and the associated reflections of the serous pericardium creates various smaller sacs and tunnels known as ''[[pericardial sinus]]es'', as well as [[radiograph]]ically significant ''pericardial recesses'',<ref name=Dixon2019>{{cite web |title=Pericardial recesses |url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pericardial-recesses|first1=Andrew |last1=Dixon |first2=Craig |last2=Hacking|access-date=2019-07-08|website=[[Radiopaedia]]}}</ref> where pericardial fluid can pool and mimic mediastinal [[lymphadenopathy]].<ref name=Dixon2019/>

===Anatomical relationships===
[[Image:Gray968.png|thumb|left|A transverse section of the [[thorax]], showing the contents of the middle and the posterior [[mediastinum]].

Pericardium is also known as cardiac epidermis.]]

* Surrounds heart and bases of pulmonary artery and aorta.
* Deep to [[Human sternum|sternum]] and anterior chest wall.
* The [[right phrenic nerve]] passes to the right of the pericardium.
* The [[left phrenic nerve]] passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle.
* Pericardial arteries supply blood to the dorsal portion of the pericardium.

==Function==
The pericardium sets the heart in mediastinum and limits its motion, protects it from infection, lubricates it and prevents excessive dilation in cases of acute volume overload.

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Pericarditis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the pericardial sac and the sac when inflamed]] 
Inflammation of the pericardium is called [[pericarditis]].  This condition typically causes chest pain that spreads to the back and is made worse by lying flat.  In patients suffering with pericarditis, a [[pericardial friction rub]] can often be heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope.  Pericarditis  is often caused by a viral infection ([[Infectious mononucleosis|glandular fever]], [[cytomegalovirus]], or [[coxsackievirus]]), or more rarely with a bacterial infection, but may also occur following a [[myocardial infarction]].  Pericarditis is usually a short-lived condition that can be successfully treated with [[Analgesic|painkillers]], [[Anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]], and [[colchicine]].  In some cases, pericarditis can become a long-term condition causing scarring of the pericardium which restricts the heart's movement, known as [[constrictive pericarditis]].  Constrictive pericarditis is sometimes treated by surgically removing the pericardium in a procedure called a [[pericardiectomy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=John G|last2=Karavas|first2=Alexandros N|last3=Colson|first3=Yolonda L|last4=Bueno|first4=Raphael|last5=Richards|first5=William G|last6=Sugarbaker|first6=David J|last7=Goldhaber|first7=Samuel Z|year=2002|title=Cardiac Decortication (Epicardiectomy) for Occult Constrictive Cardiac Physiology After Left Extrapleural Pneumonectomy|journal=Chest|volume=122|issue=6|pages=2256–9|doi=10.1378/chest.122.6.2256|pmid=12475875}}</ref>

Fluid can build up within the pericardial space, referred to as a [[pericardial effusion]].  Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to [[pericarditis]], [[kidney failure]], or [[tumour]]s and frequently do not cause any symptoms. Large effusions or effusions that accumulate rapidly can compress the heart and restrict [[diastolic]] ventricular filling in a condition known as [[cardiac tamponade]], causing [[pulsus paradoxus]] and potentially fatal [[circulatory failure]]. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called [[pericardiocentesis]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|pp=638–639}} For cases of recurrent pericardial effusion, an operation to create a hole between the pericardial and pleural spaces can be performed, known as a [[pericardial window]] or ''pericardiostomy''.

The congenital absence of pericardium is rare. When it happens, it usually occurs on the left side. Those affected usually do not have any symptoms and they are usually discovered incidentally. About 30 to 50 percent of the affected people have other heart abnormalities such as atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, bicuspid aortic valve, and lung abnormalities. On chest X–ray, the heart looks posteriorly rotated. Another feature is the sharp delineation of pulmonary artery and transverse aorta due to lung deposition between these two structures.  If there is partial absence of pericardium, there will be bulge of the left atrial appendage. On CT and MRI scans, similar findings as chest X–ray can be shown. The left sided partial pericardium defect is difficult to see because even a normal pericardium is difficult to be seen on CT and MRI. A complete pericardial defect will show the heart displaced to the left with part of the lungs squeezed between inferior border of heart and diaphragm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kligerman|first=Seth|date=January 2019|title=Imaging of Pericardial Disease|journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America|language=en|volume=57|issue=1|pages=179–199|doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2018.09.001|pmid=30454812|s2cid=53872634}}</ref>
