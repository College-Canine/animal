'''Stenotic nares''' means the [[nares]] (nostrils) are pinched or narrow, making it more difficult for an animal to breathe, and resulting in a lot of open-mouth breathing and panting.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vin.com/doc/?id=8156779|title=Brachycephalic Airway Obstruction Syndrome in Flat-Faced Dogs|first=Wendy|last=Brooks (DVM, DABVP)|date=May 5, 2021|website=Vin.com}}</ref> The condition is part of the [[brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome]] syndrome common to short-nosed dog<ref name=aes>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aesculight.com/case-studies/co2-laser-allows-bloodless-repair-of-stenotic-nares/|title=Laser Bloodless Repair of Stenotic Nares|last=Core|first=Daniel|date=2014-04-02|newspaper=Aesculight|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en-US}}</ref> and cat breeds.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32175790/|title=Single pedicle advancement flap for treatment of feline stenotic nares: technique and results in five cases|first1=Chanel N|last1=Berns|first2=Chad W|last2=Schmiedt|first3=Vanna M|last3=Dickerson|first4=Sean M|last4=Murphy|date=December 27, 2020|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1238–1242|via=PubMed|doi=10.1177/1098612X20910539|pmid=32175790|s2cid=212729530}}</ref> Dog breeds commonly affected by stenotic nares include [[Boston Terrier]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Bulldog]], [[King Charles Spaniel]], [[Lhasa Apso]], [[Pug]], and [[Shih Tzu]]. Stenotic nares is a [[congenital]] trait, meaning an animal is born with it.  [[Veterinarian]]s can perform a simple surgery to help widen the nares, which can be done at the same time as a [[Spaying and neutering|spay or neuter]] surgery.

==Treatment==
Several [[Resection (surgery)|resection]] techniques exist to help correct stenotic nares including alar wing amputation (Trader's technique), punch resection, vertical wedge, horizontal wedge, alapexy, and [[laser ablation]].<ref name="Keats">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvm360.com/view/brachycephalic-airway-syndrome-part-1-correcting-stenotic-nares|title=Brachycephalic airway syndrome, Part 1: Correcting stenotic nares|website=DVM 360|date=April 1, 2012|first=Matthew M|last=Keats (DVM, DACVS)}}</ref> [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO<sub>2</sub> laser]] repair of the stenotic nares is bloodless, allowing a clear view of the surgical field and more precise surgical incisions.<ref name=aes /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/surgical-lasers-arent-just-for-teaching-hospitals/|title=Surgical Lasers Aren't Just For Teaching Hospitals|date=March 22, 2012|website=Veterinary Practice News|first=Lou Anne|last=Epperley (DVM)}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Since stenotic nares is congenital, there is no prevention other than breeding the trait out over generations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Breeding French bulldogs so that they breathe well—A long way to go|first1=Eva-Marie|last1=Ravn-Mølby|first2=Line|last2=Sindahl|first3=Søren Saxmose|last3=Nielsen|first4=Camilla S|last4=Bruun|first5=Peter|last5=Sandøe|first6=Merete|last6=Fredholm|date=December 16, 2019|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=14|issue=12|pages=e0226280|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0226280|pmid=31841527|pmc=6913956|quote=A lenient way to ensure that the prevalence of BS [Brachycephalic syndrome] is reduced among French bulldogs would be to avoid using dogs with severely stenotic nares for breeding. This would lead to progress, albeit at a very slow pace since dogs with moderately stenotic nares would have a negative impact on the progress. However, slow progress must be accepted to avoid a devastating reduction in genetic diversity within the breed.|doi-access=free|bibcode=2019PLoSO..1426280R }}</ref>
