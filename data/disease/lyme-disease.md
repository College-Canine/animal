The [[incubation period]] is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years).<ref name="Lymedisease"/> Lyme symptoms most often occur from the month of May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases.<ref name="Lymedisease" />

===Early localized infection===
80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the [[armpit]], [[groin]], [[Popliteal fossa|back of the knee]], or the [[Torso|trunk]] under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck.<ref name=wright_2012/><ref name=NEJM2014/> Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3&nbsp;cm per day up to a diameter of 5–70&nbsp;cm (median is 16&nbsp;cm).<ref name=wright_2012/><ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name=tibbles_2007>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tibbles CD, Edlow JA | title = Does this patient have erythema migrans? | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 23 | pages = 2617–2627 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17579230 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.23.2617 }}</ref>

The rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center.<ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name=CDC_Lyme_rashes/><ref name=lyme_rashes_uk/> This rash is termed an [[Erythema migrans|Erythema Migrans (EM)]] which translates as "Migrating Redness." In about 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges possibly forming a "bull's eye" or "target-like" pattern, but this clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States.<ref name=tibbles_2007/><ref name=CDC_Lyme_rashes/><ref name=lyme_rashes_uk/> The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>

The Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms.<ref name=NEJM2014/>

People with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite [[Antibiotic|antibiotic]] treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of [[leukopenia|white]] or [[anemia|red]] cells or [[thrombocytopenia|platelets]] in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other [[tick-borne diseases]] such as [[ehrlichiosis]] and [[babesiosis]].<ref name="idsa guideline"/>

Not everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms, and many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/lyme-disease/| title=Lyme Disease|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 9 July 2021}}</ref>

[[Asymptomatic]] infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States.<ref name="pmid12905137"/> Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe.<ref name="pmid23319969"/>

===Early disseminated infection===

=== Tick life cycle ===
[[File:Deer Tick life cycle.svg|thumb|Deer tick life cycle]]
[[File:Ixodes scapularis.png|thumb|right|''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'', the primary vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America]]
Three stages occur in the life cycle of a tick - larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and are usually most active in late spring and early summer in regions where the climate is mild. During the adult stage, Lyme disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and tend to be larger in size, so can be easily seen and removed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UpToDate|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease|access-date=2021-07-10|website=www.uptodate.com}}</ref>

===Transmission===
Lyme disease is classified as a [[zoonosis]], as it is [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] to humans from a [[natural reservoir]] among small mammals and birds by [[tick]]s that feed on both sets of [[Host (biology)|hosts]].<ref name=pmid18452798/> Hard-bodied ticks of the genus ''Ixodes'' are the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of Lyme disease (also the vector for ''[[Babesia]]'').<ref name=Sherris /> Most infections are caused by ticks in the [[Nymph (biology)|nymphal stage]], because they are very small, thus may feed for long periods of time undetected.<ref name=pmid18452798/> Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body.<ref name=Rut2005>{{cite web | url = https://ocean.njaes.rutgers.edu/garden/documents/fs443.pdf | title = 2005 Fact Sheet, Prevent Tick Bites: Prevent Lyme Disease | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626133450/http://ocean.njaes.rutgers.edu/garden/documents/fs443.pdf | archive-date=26 June 2013 | publisher = Rutgers University, Rutgers Cooperative Research & Extension, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station | vauthors = Smith-Fiola D, Hamilton GC | date = March 2005 }}</ref> Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.deseret.com/2019/5/31/20674560/people-are-freaking-out-over-the-cdc-s-photo-of-a-muffin-with-ticks-in-it | title = People are freaking out over the CDC's photo of a muffin with ticks in it | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200125192618/https://www.deseret.com/2019/5/31/20674560/people-are-freaking-out-over-the-cdc-s-photo-of-a-muffin-with-ticks-in-it | archive-date=25 January 2020 | work = Deseret News | location = Utah | vauthors = Scribner H | date = 31 May 2019 | quote = The U.S. CDC published a picture of a poppy seed muffin in which some of the "poppy seeds" were actually ticks }}</ref> The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected.<ref name=pmid15117014/> Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire ''Borrelia'' from deer, instead they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the [[white-footed mouse]], and occasionally birds.<ref name="Westport">{{cite web |title = Westport Weston Health District |url = http://www.wwhd.org/TLD_CD/deertick.htm |year = 2004 |access-date = 26 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929110519/http://www.wwhd.org/TLD_CD/deertick.htm |archive-date = 29 September 2013}}</ref> Areas where Lyme is common are expanding.<ref name=CDC-Lyme-Data/>

Within the tick midgut, the ''Borrelia''{{'}}s [[Lyme disease microbiology#Outer surface proteins|outer surface protein]] A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the'' Borrelia'' [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulates]] OspA and [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulates]] OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection.<ref name=hovius_2007/> Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC.<ref name="pmid15085185"/>

Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics|title=Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)| vauthors = Hu L |date=13 May 2019|website=www.uptodate.com|publisher=UpToDate|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101124546/https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics|archive-date=1 January 2020|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>

While ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi|B. burgdorferi]]'' is most associated with ticks hosted by [[white-tailed deer]] and [[White-footed Mouse|white-footed mice]], ''[[Borrelia afzelii]]'' is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding [[Disease vector|vector]] ticks, and ''[[Borrelia garinii]]'' and ''[[Borrelia valaisiana]]'' appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for ''B. burgdorferi sensu stricto''. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease [[Spirochaete|spirochetes]] to the [[bacteriolytic]] activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association.<ref name="pmid16820453" />

Budding research has suggested that ''B. burgdorferi sensu lato'' may also be able to form [[enzootic]] cycle among lizard populations;<ref name="pmid17417956" /> this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations of lizards, such as California. Except for one study in Europe,<ref name="pmid16820453"/> much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them.<ref name="pmid17417956"/><ref name="pmid17626342"/><ref name="pmid17427701"/><ref name="pmid17326941"/> As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with ''Borrelia'', it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific.<ref name="pmid16995383"/>

[[File:Ixodes-ricinus-life-cycle.jpg|thumb|right|Tick ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'', developmental stages]]
In Europe, the main vector is ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'', which is also called the sheep tick or [[Castor oil plant|castor bean]] tick.<ref name=de_1997/> In China, ''[[Ixodes persulcatus]]'' (the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector.<ref name=Sun_2003/> In North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick (''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'') is the main vector on the East Coast.<ref name=pmid15117014/>

The lone star tick (''[[Amblyomma americanum]]''), which is found throughout the Southeastern United States as far west as [[Texas]], is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease [[spirochete]]s,<ref name=Ledin_2005/> though it may be implicated in a related syndrome called [[southern tick-associated rash illness]], which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease.<ref name=Masters2008/>

On the [[West Coast of the United States]], the main vector is the western black-legged tick (''[[Ixodes pacificus]]'').<ref name="Clark"/> The tendency of this tick species to feed predominantly on host species such as the [[Western Fence Lizard]] that are resistant to ''Borrelia'' infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West.<ref name="pmid15709249"/><ref name="pmid16995383"/>

''B. burgdorferi'' can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system.<ref name="pmid15085185"/><ref name="pmid17509489"/> ''B.

The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion.<ref name="pmid15085185"/> [[Neutrophils]], however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.<ref name="pmid17404293"/>

Days to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of ''B. burgdorferi'' is aided by the attachment of the host protease [[plasmin]] to the surface of the spirochete.<ref name="pmid9215633"/>

If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of ''B. burgdorferi'' antibodies by the immune system.<ref name=pmid11450660/> The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, [[antigenic variation]] of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as [[Complement system|complement]], and hiding in the [[extracellular matrix]], which may interfere with the function of immune factors.<ref name="pmid18097481"/><ref name="pmid17600717"/>

===Immunological studies===
Exposure to the ''Borrelia'' bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging [[inflammatory response]],<ref name=Ercolini/> a form of pathogen-induced [[autoimmune]] disease.<ref name=Singh/> The production of this reaction might be due to a form of [[molecular mimicry]], where ''Borrelia'' avoids being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues.<ref name=Oldstone_1998/><ref name=Raveche_2005/>

Chronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to [[rheumatic fever]], but its wider application is controversial.<ref name=Weinstein_2002/><ref name=Bolz_2004/>

==Diagnosis==
Lyme disease is [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as [[erythema migrans]] (EM) rash, [[facial palsy]], or [[arthritis]]), history of possible exposure to infected [[ticks]], and possibly [[#Laboratory testing|laboratory tests]].<ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name=wright_2012/> People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1–2 months.<ref name="idsa guideline"/> Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is [[endemic (epidemiology)|common]], within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended.<ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name=wright_2012/><ref name="Brown"/><ref name="Hofmann"/> Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash need not look like a bull's eye (most EM rashes in the U.S. do not) or be accompanied by any other symptoms.<ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name="Wormser"/> In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the [[New England]] and [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] states and parts of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]], but it is expanding into other areas.<ref name=CDC-Lyme-Data>{{cite web |title=Lyme Disease Data and surveillance |url=https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/ |website=Lyme Disease |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=12 April 2019 |date=5 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413133319/https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/ |archive-date=13 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several bordering areas of Canada also have high Lyme risk.<ref name=canada_lyme_map>{{cite web | title = Lyme Disease risk areas map | url = https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/risk-lyme-disease.html#map | website = Risk of Lyme disease to Canadians | publisher = Government of Canada | access-date = 8 May 2019 | date = 27 January 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190510195225/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/lyme-disease/risk-lyme-disease.html#map | archive-date = 10 May 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Laboratory testing===
Tests for antibodies in the blood by [[ELISA]] and [[Western blot]] is the most widely used method for Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC): the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] Western blot is run.<ref name=Wilske_2005/> The [[immune system]] takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] and [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] usually can first be detected respectively at 2–4 weeks and 4–6 weeks, and peak at 6–8 weeks.<ref name=Depietropaolo-2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = DePietropaolo DL, Powers JH, Gill JM, Foy AJ | title = Diagnosis of lyme disease | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 297–304 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16050454 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cir464 | doi-access = free }}</ref> When an EM rash first appears, detectable antibodies may not be present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash.<ref name="idsa guideline"/> Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered.<ref name=Depietropaolo-2005/> A positive IgM and negative IgG test result after the first month of infection is generally indicative of a false-positive result.<ref name="ALDF-serologic-tests">{{cite web |title=Are serological tests of any value in the diagnosis of Lyme disease? |url=https://www.aldf.com/are-serological-tests-of-any-value-in-the-diagnosis-of-lyme-disease-2/ |website=American Lyme Disease Foundation |access-date=2 December 2019 |ref=ALDF-serologic-tests |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219210825/https://www.aldf.com/are-serological-tests-of-any-value-in-the-diagnosis-of-lyme-disease-2/ |archive-date=19 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4–6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years.<ref name=Depietropaolo-2005/>

Other tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by [[Borrelia garinii]] and almost always involves [[lymphocytic pleocytosis]], i.e. the densities of [[lymphocytes]] (infection-fighting cells) and protein in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal.<ref name=steere_neuro_findings/><ref name="idsa guideline"/><ref name=ogrinc_bannwarth/> Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF.<ref name="idsa guideline"/><ref name=ogrinc_bannwarth/> Demonstration by [[lumbar puncture]] and CSF analysis of pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production are required for definite diagnosis of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with [[acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]], which usually is caused by [[Borrelia afzelii]] and confirmed by blood antibody tests).<ref name=efns_guidelines/> In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by [[Borrelia burgdorferi]] and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs; they confirm a diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) neuroborreliosis if positive, but do not exclude it if negative.<ref name=Coyle_1995/> American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g. facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms.<ref name="idsa guideline"/><ref name="pmid17522387"/> Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore can be used as objective markers of treatment success and inform decisions on whether to retreat.<ref name=ogrinc_bannwarth/> In infection involving the PNS, [[electromyography]] and [[nerve conduction studies]] can be used to monitor objectively the response to treatment.<ref name=steere_neuro_findings/>

In Lyme carditis, [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiograms]] are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while [[echocardiography]] may show [[Cardiac muscle|myocardial]] dysfunction.<ref name=fish_2008/> [[Biopsy]] and confirmation of Borrelia cells in myocardial tissue may be used in specific cases but are usually not done because of risk of the procedure.<ref name=fish_2008/>

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material ([[DNA]]) of the Lyme disease spirochete. Culture or PCR are the current means for detecting the presence of the organism, as [[Serology|serologic]] studies only test for [[antibodies]] of ''Borrelia''. PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] results, e.g. by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination.<ref name="pmid11438915"/><ref name=efns_guidelines/> Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) during infection.<ref name="pmid16020686"/><ref name=efns_guidelines/> Hence, PCR tests are recommended only in special cases, e.g. diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ''ospA'' DNA in synovial fluid.<ref name="pmid8272083"/> Although sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g. in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] people.<ref name=efns_guidelines/>

Several other forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. [[Lyme disease microbiology|OspA antigens]], shed by live ''Borrelia'' bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hyde FW, Johnson RC, White TJ, Shelburne CE | title = Detection of antigens in urine of mice and humans infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, etiologic agent of Lyme disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–61 | date = January 1989 | pmid = 2913036 | pmc = 267232 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.27.1.58-61.1989 }}</ref> The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shafagati N, Patanarut A, Luchini A, Lundberg L, Bailey C, Petricoin E, Liotta L, Narayanan A, Lepene B, Kehn-Hall K | title = The use of Nanotrap particles for biodefense and emerging infectious disease diagnostics | journal = Pathogens and Disease | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–176 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24449537 | pmc = 7108521 | doi = 10.1111/2049-632X.12136 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shafagati N, Patanarut A, Luchini A, Lundberg L, Bailey C, Petricoin E, Liotta L, Narayanan A, Lepene B, Kehn-Hall K | title = The use of Nanotrap particles for biodefense and emerging infectious disease diagnostics | journal = Pathogens and Disease | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–176 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24449537 | pmc = 7108521 | doi = 10.1111/2049-632x.12136 | doi-access = free }}</ref> High [[titer]]s of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to ''Borrelia'' antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.<ref name=Burdash_1991/>

The CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell-wall-deficient forms of ''B. burgdorferi'', and lymphocyte transformation tests.<ref name="pmid16020686"/>

===Imaging===
[[Neuroimaging]] is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to [[neuroborreliosis]], but may aid in [[differential diagnosis]] and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.<ref name="Hildenbrand2009"/> Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vasculitis and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], which makes them questionable.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Westervelt HJ, McCaffrey RJ | title = Neuropsychological functioning in chronic Lyme disease | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–177 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12428915 | doi = 10.1023/A:1020381913563 | s2cid = 2807397 }}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
Community clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23–28% of [[Erythema migrans]] (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease.<ref name=aucott_2008/> EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as [[spider bites]], [[cellulitis]], or [[shingles]].<ref name=aucott_2008/> Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like a bull's eye.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Actually, the key distinguishing features of the EM rash are the speed and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2–3&nbsp;cm/day and a diameter of at least 5&nbsp;cm, and in 50% of cases more than 16&nbsp;cm. The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash.<ref name=wright_2012/><ref name=tibbles_2007/> Compared to EM rashes, [[spider bites]] are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause [[necrosis]] (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin).<ref name=wright_2012/><ref name=NEJM2014/> [[Cellulitis]] most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender.<ref name=wright_2012/><ref name=NEJM2014/> EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of knee.<ref name=wright_2012/> Like Lyme, [[shingles]] often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However, unlike Lyme, in shingles these symptoms are usually followed by appearance of rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]], and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests.<ref name=Dwo2007>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworkin RH, Johnson RW, Breuer J, Gnann JW, Levin MJ, Backonja M, Betts RF, Gershon AA, Haanpaa ML, McKendrick MW, Nurmikko TJ, Oaklander AL, Oxman MN, Pavan-Langston D, Petersen KL, Rowbotham MC, Schmader KE, Stacey BR, Tyring SK, van Wijck AJ, Wallace MS, Wassilew SW, Whitley RJ | title = Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 44 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S1-26 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17143845 | doi = 10.1086/510206 | s2cid = 10894629 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Facial palsy]] caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as [[Bell's palsy]].<ref name=garro_2018/> Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common.<ref name=garro_2018/> Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face.<ref name=garro_2018/> Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP.<ref name=garro_2018/> Recent history of exposure to a likely tick habitat during warmer months, EM rash, viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever, and/or palsy in both sides of the face should be evaluated for the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, [[empiric therapy]] with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease.<ref name=garro_2018/>

Unlike [[viral meningitis]], Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends to not cause fever, last longer, and recur.<ref name=steere_neuro_findings/><ref name="idsa guideline"/> Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with [[Erythema migrans|EM rash]], [[facial palsy]], or [[Papilledema|partial vision obstruction]] and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]].<ref name="idsa guideline"/>

Lyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as [[diverticulitis]] and [[acute coronary syndrome]].<ref name=halperin_2010/><ref name=aucott_2008/> Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new "great imitator".<ref name=Pachner_1989/> As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms.<ref name="Branda 541–7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Branda JA, Linskey K, Kim YA, Steere AC, Ferraro MJ | title = Two-tiered antibody testing for Lyme disease with use of 2 enzyme immunoassays, a whole-cell sonicate enzyme immunoassay followed by a VlsE C6 peptide enzyme immunoassay | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 541–547 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21865190 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cir464 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Preventive antibiotics===
<!-- prophylaxis if found early -->
The risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment.<ref name=wright_2012/> It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva.<ref name=wright_2012/> If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying ''Borrelia'' is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease. It is not generally recommended for all people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e. the typical rash found in about 70–80% of people infected).<ref name=NEJM2014/><ref name=wright_2012/>

Outdoor workers are at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with infected ticks. This includes construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, railroad work, oil field work, utility line work, park or wildlife management.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC – Lyme Disease – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 3 November 2015|url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151113075310/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/|archive-date = 13 November 2015|date = 3 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Risks: Lyme Disease {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/risks.html |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=26 April 2019 |language=en-us |date=14 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426005009/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/risks.html |archive-date=26 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks.

===Host animals===
Ticks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including [[lizards]], [[birds]], [[mice]], [[cats]], [[dogs]], [[deer]], [[cattle]] and [[humans]]. The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as "dilution hosts" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and so decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. [[White-tailed deer]] are both a food source and a "reproductive host", where ticks tend to mate. The [[white-footed mouse]]  is a [[reservoir host]] in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. Availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted.<ref name="Chrobak">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chrobak U |title=Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are on the rise. But why? |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=3 February 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-020222-1 |doi-access=free |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2022/lyme-other-tickborne-diseases-rise |access-date=4 March 2022}}</ref>

In the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, [[Monhegan, Maine]],<ref name="Rand"/> and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut.<ref name=managing_deer_2007/>  Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates.<ref name=kirby_2004/>

Others have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' reservoirs. Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like [[white-footed mice]] and [[Eastern chipmunks]], may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that  [[deforestation]] and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission.<ref name="Chrobak"/>

Tick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of [[cattle]] worldwide.<ref name="Rochlin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochlin I, Toledo A | title = Emerging tick-borne pathogens of public health importance: a mini-review | journal = Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 781–791 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 32478654 | pmc = 7451033 | doi = 10.1099/jmm.0.001206 }}</ref> They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of [[ticks of domestic animals]] through the use of [[acaricide]]s has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on a number of grounds.  Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment.<ref name="Rajput">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajput ZI, Hu SH, Chen WJ, Arijo AG, Xiao CW | title = Importance of ticks and their chemical and immunological control in livestock | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University.

===Canine vaccines===
[[Vaccination of dogs|Canine vaccines]] have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet-[[Schering-Plough]]'s vaccine, targets [[Virulence-related outer membrane protein family|proteins OspC and OspA]]. The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that have not been killed by the OspA antibodies. Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by [[Merial]], generates antibodies against the OspA protein so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog.<ref name="Brooks, DVM"/>

=== Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome ===
Chronic symptoms like pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment are experienced by 10&ndash;20% of people who contract Lyme disease, even after completing treatment. This is called Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bai NA, Richardson CS | title = Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: A systematic review and comparison of pathogenesis | journal = Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–190 | date = September 2023 | pmid = 37711861 | pmc = 10497844 | doi = 10.1002/cdt3.74 }}</ref><ref name="CDC_2016" /> 

The cause is unknown.  One hypothesis is that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains.  Work with mice, dogs, and non-human primates have shown evidence of persistent ''B. burgdorferi'', although these remaining bacteria are hard to cultivate and [[Koch's postulates]] are hard to prove. Another hypothesis is that autoimmunity has been triggered by the infection. Auto–immune responses are known to occur following other infections, including ''Campylobacter'' ([[Guillain-Barré syndrome]]), ''Chlamydia'' (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease). A third hypothesis is that symptoms are simply unrelated to the previous Lyme infection.<ref name="CDC_2016">{{cite web |date=3 November 2016 |title=Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome |url=https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/postLDS/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617203133/https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/postlds/index.html |archive-date=17 June 2017 |publisher=CDC}}{{PD-notice}}</ref><ref name="Post-treatment Lyme, Rebman">[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7052487/ "Post-treatment Lyme Disease as a Model for Persistent Symptoms in Lyme Disease"], ''Frontiers in Medicine'' (Lausanne), Alison W Rebman, John N Aucott, PMCID: PMC7052487, Feb. 25, 2020.</ref>

There is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective in early Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotics are not. They have been shown ineffective in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is symptomatic and is similar to the management of [[fibromyalgia]] or [[Chronic fatigue syndrome|ME/CFS]]. PTLDS usually gets better over time, but recovery may take many months.<ref name="CDC_2016" />

===Europe===
In Europe, Lyme disease is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete ''B. burgdorferi sensu lato'', mainly transmitted by the tick ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]''.<ref name="pmid21794218"/> Cases of ''B. burgdorferi sensu lato''-infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in [[Slovenia]] and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent.<ref name="pmid16819127"/> Number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower.<ref name="pmid17130658"/> Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandekerckhove O, De Buck E, Van Wijngaerden E | title = Lyme disease in Western Europe: an emerging problem?

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since voluntary reporting was introduced in 1986<ref name=hpaEpidemiology/> when 68 cases were recorded in the UK and Ireland combined.<ref name=Muhlemann_1987/> In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990,<ref name=hansard1991/> but 973 in 2009<ref name=hpaEpidemiology /> and 953 in 2010.<ref name=hpa5-15/> Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010.<ref name=disease_action_2011/>

It is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's [[Health Protection Agency]] estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year<ref name=hpa5-15 /> (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas<ref name=hpaEpidemiology />), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 "to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor."<ref name=cassidy_2011/><ref name=danger_2009/>

Despite Lyme disease (''Borrelia burgdorferi'' infection) being a [[notifiable disease]] in Scotland<ref name=scotland_2012/> since January 1990<ref name=hansard_1997/> which should therefore be reported on the basis of clinical suspicion, it is believed that many [[General practitioner|GPs]] are unaware of the requirement.<ref name=fox_2010/> Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010.<ref name=hpaEpidemiology />

Although there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the [[New Forest]], [[Salisbury Plain]], [[Exmoor]], the [[South Downs]], parts of [[Wiltshire]] and [[Berkshire]], [[Thetford Forest]],<ref name=hpa_2013/> and the West coast and islands of Scotland,<ref name=defra_2009/> infected ticks are widespread, and can even be found in the parks of London.<ref name=hansard1991 /><ref name=tick_bite/> A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were [[seropositive]], as were between 2% and 4–5% of the general local population of the area.<ref name="pmid8037992"/><ref name="pmid2563850"/>

Tests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought.<ref name=Smith_2012/><ref name=bbc_dogs_2012/> It is speculated that [[global warming]] may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection.<ref name=londong_2008/> However no published research has proven this to be so.

===North America===
Many studies in North America have examined ecological and environmental correlates of the number of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of ''I. scapularis'' projected that [[Effects of climate change on human health|climate change would cause]] an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions in Canada, increased suitability in the central U.S., and decreased suitable habitat and vector retraction in the southern U.S.<ref name=Brownstein_etal_2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brownstein JS, Holford TR, Fish D | title = Effect of Climate Change on Lyme Disease Risk in North America | journal = EcoHealth | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–46 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 19008966 | pmc = 2582486 | doi = 10.1007/s10393-004-0139-x }}</ref> A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or forested areas was the only variable that consistently elevated the risk of Lyme disease whereas other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies.<ref name=Killilea_etal_2008>{{cite journal | vauthors = Killilea ME, Swei A, Lane RS, Briggs CJ, Ostfeld RS | title = Spatial dynamics of lyme disease: a review | journal = EcoHealth | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–195 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18787920 | doi = 10.1007/s10393-008-0171-3 | url = http://www.caryinstitute.org/sites/default/files/public/reprints/2008_Killilea_EcoHealth_Spatial_Dynamics.pdf | url-status = live | s2cid = 13545850 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.580.8928 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908101635/http://www.caryinstitute.org/sites/default/files/public/reprints/2008_Killilea_EcoHealth_Spatial_Dynamics.pdf | archive-date = 8 September 2015 }}</ref> The authors argued that the factors influencing tick density and human risk between sites are still poorly understood, and that future studies should be conducted over longer time periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme [[disease ecology]].<ref name=Killilea_etal_2008/>

====Canada====
The range of ticks able to carry Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland.<ref name=canada_lyme_map/><ref name=min_ag_2012/><ref name=fact_sheet_2012/><ref name=Ogden_2009/> A model-based prediction by Leighton ''et al.'' (2012) suggests that the range of the ''I. scapularis'' tick will expand into Canada by 46&nbsp;km/year over the next decade, with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread.<ref name=Leighton_2012/>

====Mexico====
A 2007 study suggests ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000.<ref name="cdc_dispatch_oct_2007" />

====United States====
[[File:Lyme Disease Risk Map.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] and western [[Wisconsin]]]]

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005.<ref name=cdc_stats_2012/><ref name=mmwr_2007/><ref name=Bacon_2008/>

Although Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central).<ref name=CDC-FAQ/><ref name=cdc_stats2/><ref name="nytimes.com"/> CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria has been modified multiple times.<ref name="cdc-surveillance">{{cite web |title=National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) - Lyme Disease |url=https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/ |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=11 January 2023 |date=7 September 2021}}</ref> The 2022 surveillance case definition classifies cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect.<ref name="cdc-surveillance-2022">{{cite web |title=Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) 2022 Case Definition  |url=https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/lyme-disease-2022/ |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=11 January 2023 |date=12 August 2022}}</ref> The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.

The CDC emphasizes that, while surveillance data has limitations, it is useful due to "uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness." While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted.<ref name="cdc-surveillance-faq">{{cite web |title=Lyme disease surveillance and available data |url=https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=11 January 2023 |language=en-us |date=15 November 2022}}</ref><ref name=CDC-FAQ/>

Several similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of ''Borrelia'' in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to ''Borrelia'' infection is [[southern tick-associated rash illness]] (STARI), also known as Masters disease. ''[[Amblyomma americanum]]'', known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms—especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick—should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/index.html|title=STARI or Lyme?|date=19 November 2018|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112160112/https://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/index.html|archive-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>

In recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily in pockets along the [[Yellowstone River]] in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

===South America===
In Brazil, a Lyme-like disease known as [[Baggio–Yoshinari syndrome]] was identified, caused by microorganisms that do not belong to the ''B. burgdorferi sensu lato'' complex and transmitted by ticks of the ''[[Amblyomma]]'' and ''[[Rhipicephalus]]'' genera.<ref name=Mantovani_2007/> The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in [[Cotia]], São Paulo.<ref name=Yoshinari_1993/>

== Etymology ==
Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in [[Lyme, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Murray P |title=The Widening Circle : A Lyme Disease Pioneer Tells Her Story|date=1006|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-14068-7}}</ref>

==History==
The evolutionary history of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' genetics has been examined by scientists. One study has found that prior to the [[reforestation]] that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in [[New England]] and the wholesale migration into the [[mid-west]] that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease was present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest.<ref name=Hoen_2009/>

John Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663 to 1670, wrote "there be infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them."<ref name=Josselyn_1670/>

This is also confirmed by the writings of [[Peter Kalm]], a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], and who found the forests of New York "abound" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.<ref name=Drymon_2008/>

Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]] after a visit to the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764.<ref name=summerton_1995/> He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with "exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a "worm" with a body which is "of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side" that "penetrates the skin". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=US Voyage New World |url=https://www.ulsterscotsagency.com/fs/doc/new_range_of_ulster-scots_booklets/US_Voyage_New_World_BK7_AW_3.pdf |access-date=May 1, 2024 |website=www.ulsterscotsagency.com}}</ref>

The examination of preserved museum specimens has found ''Borrelia'' DNA in an infected ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894.<ref name=Drymon_2008/> The 2010 autopsy of [[Ötzi the Iceman]], a 5,300-year-old [[mummy]], revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.<ref name="ngautopsy"/>

The early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in [[Breslau]], Germany (now [[Wrocław]], Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who for 16 years had had a degenerative [[skin disorder]] now known as [[acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans]].<ref name="Afzelius1910"/>

At a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist [[Arvid Afzelius]] presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion ''erythema migrans''.<ref name="Afzelius1910" /> The skin condition now known as [[borrelial lymphocytoma]] was first described in 1911.<ref name=burckhardt_1911/>

The modern history of medical understanding of the disease, including its cause, diagnosis, and treatment, has been difficult.<ref name=Edlow_2003/>

Neurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory [[radiculitis]] accompanied by mild [[meningitis]] following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related.<ref name=hellerstrom_1930/> In the 1940s, German neurologist [[Alfred Bannwarth]] described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.

Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM.<ref name=lenhoff_1948/> Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}} Starting in 1946, facilities in Sweden experimented with treating EM rashes with substances known to kill spirochetes.<ref name="hollstrom-1951">{{cite journal |last1=Hollström |first1=Einar |title=Successful treatment of erythema migrans Afzelius. |journal=Acta Dermato-venereologica |date=1951 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=235–43 |doi=10.2340/0001555531235243 |doi-broken-date=4 May 2024 |pmid=14829185 |url=https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content_files/files/pdf/31/2/31235243.pdf}}</ref> {{ill|Einar Hollström|sv}} reported that "penicillin was found to be the most effective."<ref name="hollstrom-1958">{{cite journal |last1=Hollström |first1=Einar |title=Penicillin Treatment of erythema chronicum migrans afzelius |journal=Acta Dermato-Venereologica |date=1958 |volume=38 |issue=5 |doi=10.2340/0001555538285289|doi-broken-date=4 May 2024 |url=https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content_files/files/pdf/38/5/38285289.pdf}}</ref> In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin.<ref name="pmid18140373"/> In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of [[penicillin]] for treatment in Europe.<ref name=Bianchi_1950/><ref name=Paschoud_1954/>

In 1970, a dermatologist in [[Wisconsin]] named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin.<ref name=Scrimenti_1970/>

The full [[syndrome]] now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]] was identified in three towns in southeastern [[Connecticut]] in 1975, including the towns [[Lyme, Connecticut|Lyme]] and [[Old Lyme]], which gave the disease its popular name.<ref name=Borchers2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Borchers AT, Keen CL, Huntley AC, Gershwin ME | title = Lyme disease: a rigorous review of diagnostic criteria and treatment | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | pages = 82–115 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25451629 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.09.004 }}</ref> This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and [[Allen Steere]] of the [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]], and by others from [[Yale University]], including [[Stephen Malawista]], who is credited as a co-discover of the disease.<ref name=hcourant>{{cite news| vauthors = Weir W |title=Lyme Disease Pioneer Stephen Malawista Dies|url=http://articles.courant.com/2013-09-19/health/hc-malawista-lyme-0920-20130919_1_lyme-disease-rheumatology-department-disease-control|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=19 September 2013|access-date=14 October 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173239/http://articles.courant.com/2013-09-19/health/hc-malawista-lyme-0920-20130919_1_lyme-disease-rheumatology-department-disease-control|archive-date=14 October 2013}}</ref> The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that "Lyme arthritis" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe.<ref name=Sternbach/>

In 1980, Steere, ''et al.'', began to test [[antibiotics|antibiotic]] regimens in adults with Lyme disease.<ref name=Steere_1983/> In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist [[Jorge Benach]] provided [[Willy Burgdorfer]], a researcher at the [[Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory]], with collections of ''I. dammini'' [''scapularis''] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed "poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes." Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the "long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease." Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and [[Blood serum|sera]] from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour "offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism." Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from people with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks.<ref name=Burgdorfer_1984/> In June 1982, he published his findings in [[Science (journal)|Science]], and the spirochete was named ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' in his honor.<ref name=Burgdorfer_1982/>

After the identification of ''B. burgdorferi'' as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by ''in vitro'' antibiotic sensitivities, including [[tetracycline antibiotics]], [[amoxicillin]], [[cefuroxime axetil]], intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous [[ceftriaxone]].<ref name=Luft_1988/><ref name=Dattwyler_1990/> The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. ''B. burgdorferi'' spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands.<ref name=Ribeiro_1987/>

==Society, culture, and controversy==
===Landscape changes and urbanization===

Urbanization and other [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents—the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased.<ref name="The ecology of infectious disease"/><ref name="Patz"/> Researchers are investigating possible links between [[global warming]] and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.<ref name="Khasnis"/>

===The dilution effect===

Given these habitat-host dynamics, some researchers have begun to postulate whether the dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease.<ref name="The ecology of infectious disease">{{cite journal | vauthors = LoGiudice K, Ostfeld RS, Schmidt KA, Keesing F | title = The ecology of infectious disease: effects of host diversity and community composition on Lyme disease risk | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 567–571 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12525705 | pmc = 141036 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0233733100 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100..567L }}</ref> The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that an increase in host biodiversity will result in a decrease in the number of vectors infected with ''B. burgdorferi''.<ref name="The ecology of infectious disease"/> Scientific research has shown that nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) decreases as the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect.<ref name="The ecology of infectious disease"/> That said, these findings should not be misinterpreted to suggest that there is a direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven.<ref name="The ecology of infectious disease"/> Additionally, it is important to note that, thus far, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruyts SC, Landuyt D, Ampoorter E, Heylen D, Ehrmann S, Coipan EC, Matthysen E, Sprong H, Verheyen K | title = Low probability of a dilution effect for Lyme borreliosis in Belgian forests | journal = Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 1143–1152 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29716838 | doi = 10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.04.016 | publisher = Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases. | s2cid = 13746169 }}</ref>

===Chronic Lyme disease===
{{main|Chronic Lyme disease}}

The term "chronic Lyme disease" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature,<ref name="nejm-feder"/> and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease.<ref name="idsa guideline"/><ref name="pmid17522387"/><ref name="nih-cld"/> Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with "chronic Lyme disease" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with ''[[B. burgdorferi]]'' or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), which is defined as continuing or relapsing [[non-specific symptoms]] (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease.<ref name="Marques"/>

The 2008 documentary ''[[Under Our Skin]]'' is known for promoting controversial and unrecognized theories about "chronic Lyme disease".<ref name="under-our-skin-sbm">{{cite web | vauthors = MacBeth B |title=A Review of Under Our Skin, A Cult Classic |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-review-of-under-our-skin-a-cult-classic/ |website=Science-Based Medicine |access-date=10 September 2021 |date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

==Other animals==
=== Dogs ===
Prevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs is an important step.<ref name=pmid20207198/>

Another crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes ([[Amitraz]]), phenylpyrazoles ([[Fipronil]]), or permethrin ([[pyrethroids]]).<ref name=pmid20933139/> These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment.<ref name=pmid20207198/> Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.<ref name=pmid20933139/>

Examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears.<ref name=hahn/>

In dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease,<ref name=merck_2012/> which is a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease.<ref name="Brooks, DVM"/> Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated. However, the majority of cases of Lyme disease in dogs result in complete recovery with, and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics.<ref name=staubinger/>{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs.<ref name="fatal-cases"/>

=== Cats ===
Unlike dogs, it is very rare for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi|B. burgdorferi]] ,'' following a bite from an infected tick. Cats who are infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including but not limited to lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite.<ref name="Merck Veterinary Manual">{{Cite web |title=Lyme Disease (Lyme Borreliosis) in Cats - Cat Owners |url=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/cat-owners/disorders-affecting-multiple-body-systems-of-cats/lyme-disease-lyme-borreliosis-in-cats |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=Merck Veterinary Manual |language=en-US}}</ref> In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans.<ref name="Tørnqvist-Johnsen_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tørnqvist-Johnsen C, Dickson SA, Rolph K, Palermo V, Hodgkiss-Geere H, Gilmore P, Gunn-Moore DA | title = First report of Lyme borreliosis leading to cardiac bradydysrhythmia in two cats | journal = JFMS Open Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2055116919898292 | date = 2020 | pmid = 31949917 | pmc = 6950542 | doi = 10.1177/2055116919898292 }}</ref> However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be [[asymptomatic]], and show no noticeable signs of the disease.<ref name="Tørnqvist-Johnsen_2020" /><ref name="Merck Veterinary Manual" /> Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required.<ref name="Merck Veterinary Manual" />
