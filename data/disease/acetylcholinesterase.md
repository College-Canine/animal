'''Acetylcholinesterase''' ([[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|HGNC]] symbol '''ACHE'''; EC 3.1.1.7; systematic name '''acetylcholine acetylhydrolase'''), also known as '''AChE, AChase''' or '''acetylhydrolase''', is the primary [[cholinesterase]] in the body. It is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the breakdown of [[acetylcholine]] and some other [[choline]] esters that function as [[neurotransmitter]]s:

: acetylcholine + H<sub>2</sub>O = choline + acetate

It is found at mainly [[neuromuscular junction]]s and in [[chemical synapse]]s of the [[cholinergic]] type, where its activity serves to terminate [[neurotransmission|synaptic transmission]]. It belongs to the [[carboxylesterase family]] of enzymes. It is the primary target of inhibition by [[organophosphorus compound]]s such as [[nerve agent]]s and [[pesticide]]s.

In humans, AChE is a cholinergic enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into its constituents, choline, and acetate.<ref name="s00344"/>
Overall, in mammals, AChE is primarily involved in the termination of impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.<ref name="s00344"/> In non-vertebrates, AChE plays a similar role in nerve conduction processes at the neuromuscular junction. It is usually located in the membranes of these animals and controls ionic currents in excitable membranes.<ref name="s10646-006-0075-3"/><ref name="s42995-020-00065-9"/>

In plants, the biological functions of AChE are less clear, and its existence has been recognized by indirect evidence of its activity. For instance, a study on [[Solanum lycopersicum]] (tomato) identified 87 SlAChE genes containing GDSL lipase/acylhydrolase domain. The study also showed up-and down-regulation of SlAChE genes under salinity stress condition.<ref name="s00344"/>

Some marine fungi have been found to produce compounds that inhibit AChE. However, the specific role and mechanisms of AChE in fungi are not as well-studied as in mammals.<ref name="s42995-020-00065-9"/> The presence and role of AChE in bacteria is not well-documented.<ref name="s42995-020-00065-9"/>

==Biological function==
During [[neurotransmission]], ACh is released from the presynaptic neuron into the [[Synapse|synaptic]] cleft and binds to ACh receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, relaying the signal from the nerve. AChE is concentrated in the synaptic cleft, where it terminates the signal transmission by hydrolyzing ACh.<ref name=":0" /> The liberated choline is taken up again by the pre-synaptic neuron and ACh is synthesized by combining with [[acetyl-CoA]] through the action of [[choline acetyltransferase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whittaker VP | title = The Contribution of Drugs and Toxins to Understanding of Cholinergic Function | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–13 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2408211 | doi = 10.1016/0165-6147(90)90034-6 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:603084/component/escidoc:2355598/603084.pdf | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0013-0E8C-5 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, Hall WC, LaMantia AS, McNamara JO , White LE | title = Neuroscience | edition = 4th | year = 2008 | publisher = Sinauer Associates | isbn = 978-0-87893-697-7 | pages = 121–2 }}</ref>

Irreversible inhibitors of AChE may lead to muscular [[paralysis]], convulsions, [[bronchial]] constriction, and death by [[asphyxiation]].  [[Organophosphates]] (OP), esters of phosphoric acid, are a class of irreversible AChE inhibitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Pesticide Information Center-Diazinon Technical Fact Sheet|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/diazinontech.pdf|access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> Cleavage of OP by AChE leaves a phosphoryl group in the esteratic site, which is slow to be hydrolyzed (on the order of days) and can become [[covalently]] bound. Irreversible AChE inhibitors have been used in [[insecticides]]  (e.g., [[malathion]]) and nerve gases for chemical warfare (e.g., [[Sarin]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]). [[Carbamates]], esters of N-methyl carbamic acid, are AChE inhibitors that hydrolyze in hours and have been used for medical purposes (e.g., [[physostigmine]] for the treatment of [[glaucoma]]). Reversible inhibitors occupy the esteratic site for short periods of time (seconds to minutes) and are used to treat of a range of central nervous system diseases. Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) and [[donepezil]] are FDA-approved to improve cognitive function in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[Rivastigmine]] is also used to treat Alzheimer's and [[Lewy body dementia]], and [[pyridostigmine]] bromide is used to treat [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Application: Acetylcholine and Alzheimer's Disease|url=http://web.williams.edu/imput/synapse/pages/IA5.html|access-date=February 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Stoelting RK|title=Anticholinesterase Drugs and Cholinergic Agonists", in Pharmacology and Physiology in Anesthetic Practice|year=1999|publisher=Lippincott-Raven|isbn=978-0-7817-5469-9|url=http://www.anesthesia2000.com/Autonomics/Cholinergics/Cholin2.htm|access-date=February 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232519/http://www.anesthesia2000.com/Autonomics/Cholinergics/Cholin2.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Taylor P, Hardman JG, Limbird LE, Molinoff PB, Ruddon RW, Gilman AG|title=The Pharmacologial Basis of Therapeutics|year=1996|publisher=THe McGraw-Hill Companies|isbn=978-0-07-146804-6|pages=161–174|chapter-url=http://nursingpharmacology.info/Autonomics/Cholinergics/Cholin1.htm|chapter=5: Autonomic Pharmacology: Cholinergic Drugs|access-date=February 26, 2012|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043428/http://nursingpharmacology.info/Autonomics/Cholinergics/Cholin1.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-07-146804-8">{{cite book | vauthors =  Blumenthal D, Brunton L, Goodman LS, Parker K, Gilman A, Lazo JS, Buxton I | title = Goodman & Gilman's The pharmacological basis of therapeutics | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 1634 | isbn = 978-0-07-146804-6 | chapter=5: Autonomic Pharmacology: Cholinergic Drugs }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Drachman DB, Isselbacher KJ, Braunwald E, Wilson JD, Martin JB, Fauci AS, Kasper DL|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|year=1998|publisher=The McCraw-Hill Companies|isbn=978-0-07-020291-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincie14harr/page/2469 2469]–2472|edition=14|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincie14harr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Raffe RB | title = Autonomic and Somatic Nervous Systems in Netter's Illustrated Pharmacology|publisher=Elsevier Health Science|isbn=978-1-929007-60-8|pages=43| year = 2004}}</ref>

===AChE<sub>T</sub>===
The major form of acetylcholinesterase found in brain, muscle, and other tissues, known as is the hydrophilic species, which forms disulfide-linked oligomers with [[collagen]]ous, or [[lipid]]-containing structural subunits. In the neuromuscular junctions AChE expresses in asymmetric form which associates with [[COLQ|ColQ]] or subunit. In the central nervous system it is associated with [[PRIMA1|PRiMA]]  which stands for Proline Rich Membrane anchor to form symmetric form.  In either case, the ColQ or PRiMA anchor serves to maintain the enzyme in the intercellular junction, [[ColQ]] for the neuromuscular junction and PRiMA for synapses.

===AChE<sub>H</sub>===
The other, alternatively spliced form expressed primarily in the [[red blood cell|erythroid]] tissues, differs at the [[C-terminus]], and contains a cleavable [[hydrophobic]] [[peptide]] with a [[Glycophosphatidylinositol|PI-anchor]] site. It associates with [[Cell membrane|membranes]] through the [[phosphoinositide]] (PI) moieties added post-translationally.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ACHE acetylcholinesterase (Yt blood group)| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=43}}</ref>

Exposure to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is one of several studied explanations for the chronic cognitive symptoms veterans displayed after returning from the [[Gulf War]]. Soldiers were dosed with AChEI [[pyridostigmine]] bromide (PB) as protection from nerve agent weapons. Studying acetylcholine levels using microdialysis and [[HPLC]]-ECD, researchers at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine determined PB, when combined with a stress element can lead to cognitive responses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Macht VA, Woodruff JL, Maissy ES, Grillo CA, Wilson MA, Fadel JR, Reagan LP | title = Pyridostigmine bromide and stress interact to impact immune function, cholinergic neurochemistry and behavior in a rat model of Gulf War Illness | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | volume = 80 | pages = 384–393 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30953774 | pmc = 6790976 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2019.04.015 }}</ref>
