The '''Cavalier King Charles Spaniel''' ('''CKCS''') is a British [[list of dog breeds|breed]] of [[toy dog]] of [[spaniel]] type. Four colours are recognised: Blenheim (chestnut and white), [[Tricolor (dog)|tricolour]] (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby; the coat is smooth and silky.<ref name="akc.org"/> The lifespan is usually between eight and twelve years.<ref name="tvj">{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=D.

The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late seventeenth century, when it was inter-bred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, it shared the same history as the smaller [[King Charles Spaniel]]. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration – a dog resembling [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s spaniel of the [[English Civil War]] period, when supporters of the king were known as [[Cavalier]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Farina |first1=William |title=Man Writes Dog |date=2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-1455-7 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqwzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA195 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lambert |first1=Cathy |title=Getting to Know Cavaliers |date=2009 |publisher=Animalinfo |isbn=978-1-921537-13-4 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhrDLb8REiMC&pg=PA10 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Persi - Cavalier tricolor.jpg|thumb|Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; lesser stop; skull not inclined to be domed with spot in centre of skull on the Blenheim. A white blaze between the eyes is standard of the Tricolour variety.]]
[[File:Ch Jewelcroft's Going Concern CGN CD RA - Ruby Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.jpg|thumb|Correct Ruby Cavalier King Charles Spaniel; uniform chestnut colour, with no white markings; ears and slippers are often slightly lighter but dark chestnut colour should predominate]]

During the early part of the 18th&nbsp;century, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]] in honour of his victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.<ref name="moff19">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#moffat06|Moffat (2006)]], p. 19.</ref>

Attempts were made to recreate the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct [[Toy Trawler Spaniel]]s. These attempts were documented by [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]], in the book ''"Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians"'' published under the name of the "Hon. Mrs. Neville Lytton" in 1911.<ref>{{cite book |title=Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians |last=Lytton |first=Mrs. Neville |author-link=Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth |year=1911 |publisher=Duckworth & Co |location=London, England |pages=81–82 |url=https://archive.org/stream/toydogsandtheir00wentgoog#page/n11/mode/1up |access-date=29 November 2009|ref=lytton1911}}</ref>

===Divergence from King Charles Spaniel===
In 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of 25 pounds of sterling silver each as a prize for the best male and females of "Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of [[Charles II of England]]'s time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull."<ref name="toycavdiff"/> The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed.<ref name="toycavdiff"/> The first standard was created, based on a dog named "Ann's Son" owned by Mostyn Walker,<ref name="moff22">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#moffat06|Moffat (2006)]], p. 22.</ref> and the [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] recognised the variety as "King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type".<ref name="toycavdiff"/>

The [[Second World War]] caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of 60 dogs dropped to three during the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecavalierclub.co.uk/club/history.html |title=A Potted History |year=2009 |work=The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club |access-date=17 November 2009 }}</ref> Following the war, few dogs survived as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. And in 1945,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=6149|title=The Kennel Club|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref> the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.<ref name="toycavdiff"/>

The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown who, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA that continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the [[American Kennel Club]]. It was recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1995,<ref name="akc.org">{{Cite web |title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog Breed Information |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel/ |access-date=2023-12-20 |website=American Kennel Club |language=en}}</ref> and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.<ref name="moff23">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#moffat06|Moffat (2006)]], p. 23.</ref> Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 15th most popular pure-breed in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel/|title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog Breed Information|website=American Kennel Club|language=en|access-date=2022-08-23}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Olive_-_A_Black_and_Tan_Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel.jpg|thumb|alt="The purebred Black and Tan uniform."|A purebred Black and Tan uniform.]]
Historically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a [[lap dog]] and is small for a [[spaniel]], with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. The tail is usually not [[Docking (dog)|docked]],<ref name="co.za"/> and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.<ref name="co.za">{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierkingcharlesspanielclub.co.za/ |title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel |work=CavalierKingCharlesSpanielClub.co.za |access-date=15 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422133942/http://cavalierkingcharlesspanielclub.co.za/ |archive-date=22 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can often be confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the [[King Charles Spaniel]], while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between {{convert|13|and|18|lb|kg}}, the King Charles is smaller at {{convert|9|to|15|lb|kg}}. In addition, their facial features, while similar, are different; the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles's skull is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.<ref name="toycavdiff">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#coile08|Coile (2008)]], p. 9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel/|title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog Breed Information|work=American Kennel Club}}</ref>

The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers that have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honor of [[Blenheim Palace]], where [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] raised for assistance in hunting the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some Blenheim dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the "Blenheim" spot.<ref name="lamb14">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#lambert08|Lambert (2008)]], p. 14.</ref> The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the "Duchess Thumb Print", based on the legend that [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]] while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the [[Battle of Blenheim]], pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charmingcavaliers.com/cavaliers/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=58|title=The Legendary Blenheim Spot|publisher=Charming Cache Cavaliers|access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref>

Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail.<ref name="lamb15">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#lambert08|Lambert (2008)]], p. 15.</ref> Black and Tan is referred to as "King Charles" in the King Charles Spaniel.<ref name="toycavdiff"/>

Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut,<ref name="lamb16">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#lambert08|Jeff (2008)]], p. 16.</ref> although some can have some white in their coats that is considered a fault under American Kennel Club [[conformation show]] rules.<ref name="akcmeet">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/cavalier_king_charles_spaniel/|title=AKC MEET THE BREEDS: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel|publisher=American Kennel Club|access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail.<ref name="lamb15"/> This colour is referred to as "Prince Charles" in the King Charles Spaniel.<ref name="toycavdiff"/>

==Temperament==
[[File:BlenheimTn.jpg|thumb|Blenheim markings]]
The breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs.<ref name="akc.org"/> Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puppy-training-at-home.com/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel-training.html |title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Training and Cavalier Dog Breed Info |work=Puppy-Training-at-Home.com |access-date=15 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009232339/http://www.puppy-training-at-home.com/cavalier-king-charles-spaniel-training.html |archive-date=9 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life.<ref name="akc.org"/> Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.<ref name="terrific">{{cite web |url=http://www.terrificpets.com/dog_breeds/cavalier_king_charles_spaniel.asp |title=Cavalier King Charles Spaniels |work=TerrificPets.com |access-date=15 November 2009 }}</ref>

Cavaliers are active and sporting. Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures.<ref name="akc.org"/> The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.<ref name="akc.org"/>

[[File:A pair of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.JPG|thumb|The breed is well known for its loving temperament.]]
They have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become "street-wise".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ckcsc.org/ckcsc/ckcsc_inc.nsf/Founded-1954/breedgeneral.html |title=General Information  |work=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club&nbsp;– USA |access-date=15 November 2009 }}</ref> As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong [[hunting]] instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including [[hamster]]s and [[gerbil]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ckcsc.org/ckcsc/ckcsc_inc.nsf/Founded-1954/faq.html |title=Cavalier FAQ |work=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club&nbsp;– USA |access-date=15 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209000358/http://www.ckcsc.org/ckcsc/ckcsc_inc.nsf/Founded-1954/faq.html |archive-date=9 February 2010 }}</ref>

The Cavalier's coat requires weekly brushing, but no trimming.<ref name="akc.org"/> However, some owners prefer to trim their Cavalier's long feathers and slippers that can become very dirty when walking or playing outside.

Cavaliers can notably be prone to [[mitral valve disease]], which leads to [[heart failure]]. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset [[mitral valve disease]] (MVD), the potentially severely painful [[syringomyelia]] (SM), [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alex |first=Gough |title=Breed predispositions to disease in dogs and cats |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |others=Thomas, Alison, 1964– |isbn=978-1-4051-8078-8 |edition=2nd |location=Chichester, West Sussex |language=en |oclc=467711662}}</ref> As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the [[founder effect]] and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed.<ref name="coile69">[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel#coile08|Coile (2008)]], p. 69.</ref> Additionally, bad breeding increases the chance that a Cavalier will develop MVD, so it is important to find a responsible breeder who uses dogs with healthy hearts. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, [[luxating patella]], and hereditary eye issues such as [[cataract]]s and [[retinal dysplasia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etsca.org/breed.htm |title=Breed Profile: The English Toy Spaniel or King Charles Spaniel |work=English Toy Spaniel Club of America |access-date=22 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208132733/http://www.etsca.org/breed.htm |archive-date=8 December 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can have such other general conditions as [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], which are common across many types of dog breeds.

In 2022, the Oslo District Court banned the breeding of Cavalier King Charles spaniels in Norway due to their propensity for developing health problems. In its verdict the court judged that no dog of this breed could be considered healthy, therefore using them for breeding would be a violation of Norway's Animal Welfare Act.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2022-02-02|title=Norway bans breeding of British Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles spaniels|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/norway-british-bulldogs-cavalier-spaniels-b2006120.html|access-date=2022-02-10|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

===Mitral valve disease===
[[File:20070114 dog with bandaged foot.jpg|thumb|Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with [[bandage]]d [[paw]]]]
{{further|Mitral valve disease}}
Nearly all Cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease, with heart murmurs that may progressively worsen, leading to [[heart failure]]. This condition is [[polygenic]] (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1533/hscavalierkingcharlesspaniel.pdf |title=Summary Results of the Purebred Dog Health Survey for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels |work=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee Summary results |access-date=14 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724203538/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1533/hscavalierkingcharlesspaniel.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally&nbsp;– one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems&nbsp;– mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The "hinge" on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/mitral_valve_disease.htm|title=Mitral Valve Disease and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/mvdprotocol.htm|title=Mitral Valve Disease Breeding Protocol for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: "There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterwedderburn/9307223/dog_breeders_in_denial/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813011118/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peterwedderburn/9307223/dog_breeders_in_denial/|archive-date=13 August 2011|title=Dog breeders in denial|last=Wedderburn|first=Pete|date=27 March 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref> The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.<ref name="MVD Symposium">{{cite web |url=http://www.ckcsc.org/ckcsc/formsdocs.nsf/filelookup/98heartsymp.PDF/$file/98heartsymp.PDF |title=Important Findings At CKCSC, USA'S Heart Symposium |work=Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club |access-date=14 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116215711/http://www.ckcsc.org/ckcsc/formsdocs.nsf/filelookup/98heartsymp.PDF/$file/98heartsymp.PDF |archive-date=16 November 2010 }}</ref>

===Syringomyelia===
{{further|Syringomyelia}}
Syringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It is caused by a malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull that reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of [[cerebral spinal fluid]] (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence that in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30 and 70% have syrinxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/syringomyelia.htm|title=Syringomyelia (SM) and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral&nbsp;– restricted to one side of the body. Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). The scratching behaviour appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking&nbsp;– without stopping&nbsp;– in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ("bunny hopping"). Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on a leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.<ref name="Rushbridge Ph.D. thesis">{{Cite book |format=PhD thesis |title=Chiari-Like Malformation and Syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel |url=http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2007-0320-201201/index.htm |last=Rusbridge |first=Clare |year=2007 |publisher=Utrecht University |access-date=14 November 2009 |oclc=123300926 |isbn=978-90-393-4456-9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030151742/http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2007-0320-201201/index.htm |archive-date=30 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Not all dogs who show scratching behaviour appear to be in pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr. Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs. Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM Cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] region of the spine. If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing [[scoliosis]]. If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor [[proprioception]] (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.<ref name="Rushbridge Ph.D. thesis"/>

A veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as [[ear mite]]s, [[flea]]s, and allergies, and then, primary secretory [[otitis media]] (PSOM&nbsp;– glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and less expensive to treat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/psom.htm|title=Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An [[MRI]] scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan. Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade.<ref name="Rushbridge Ph.D. thesis"/>

===Episodic Falling (EF)===
[[File:Aid4.jpg|thumb|right|alt="A puppy with red fur faces the camera while looking off to the left. There is a streak of white down the middle of its head between its eyes, and it has a white chest. It wears a black collar with a metal tag.|Ruby Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy]]
<!-- [[File:Rex Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.jpg|thumb|Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] -->
Episodic Falling causes "exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity" meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder, it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available.<ref name="Gill" /> Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/episodic_falling.htm|title=Episodic Falling Syndrome (Muscle Hypertonicity): Cavaliers Collapse Suddenly After Exercise  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age.<ref name="Gill">{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Jennifer L.|last2=Tsai|first2=Kate L.|last3=Krey|first3=Christa|last4=Noorai|first4=Rooksana E.|last5=Vanbellinghen|first5=Jean-François|last6=Garosi|first6=Laurent S.|last7=Shelton|first7=G.

===Thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia===
As many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic [[thrombocytopenia]], an abnormally low number of [[platelet]]s in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements that aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis is also a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierhealth.net/platelets.htm |title=Blood Platelets in Cavaliers: Too Few (Thrombocytopenia) and Too Large (Macrothrombocytopenia)  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

===Hip and knee disorders===
Hip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia, X-rays may not always indicate the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavalierhealth.org/hipdysplasia.htm|title=Hip Dysplasia in Cavaliers: Painful and Expensive|publisher=Cavalier Health.org|access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref> In a series of evaluations by the [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals]], the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the [[Bulldog]], [[Pug]] and [[Dogue de Bordeaux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offa.org/hipstatbreed.html |title=Hip Dysplasia Statistics |publisher=Orthopedic Foundation for Animals |access-date=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203044/http://www.offa.org/hipstatbreed.html |archive-date=10 February 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Cavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the [[femur]] and knee called [[luxating patella]]. This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a Cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of [[arthritis]] and lameness in the limb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cavalierhealth.org/patellas.htm|title=Patellar Luxation in Cavaliers: Genetic and Degenerative|publisher=Cavalier Health.org|access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

===Eye problems===
A disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]], colloquially known as "dry eye". The usual cause of this condition is an [[Autoimmune diseases|autoimmune]] reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cavalierhealth.net/dry_eye.htm|title=Dry Eye Syndrome: A Life-Long Irritating Defect for Cavaliers  |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> This disorder can decrease or heal over time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upei.ca/~cidd/Diseases/ocular%20disorders/keratoconjunctivitis%20sicca%20.htm |title=What is keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)? |date=11 May 2000 |work=Canine Inherited Disorders Database |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

A 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ocular Disorders Presumed to be Inherited in Purebred Dogs |last=Wheeler |first=Cynthia A. |year=1999 |publisher=American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists |isbn=978-0-9635163-2-9 }}</ref> They include hereditary [[cataract]]s, [[Corneal dystrophies in dogs|corneal dystrophy]], [[distichiasis]], [[entropion]], [[microphthalmia]], [[progressive retinal atrophy]], and [[retinal dysplasia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierhealth.net/corneal.htm |title=Corneal Dystrophy and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

===Ear disorders===
Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), also known as glue ear, consists of a highly viscous mucus plug that fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers that actually have PSOM and not SM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierhealth.net/psom.htm |title=Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM) in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppy-hood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cavalierhealth.net/deafness.htm |title=Deafness in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels can be Congenital or Progressive |publisher=CavalierHealth.org |access-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref>

We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it."<ref name="parliament.uk"/> Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: "This law has been quoted from time to time.
