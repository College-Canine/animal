'''Uveitis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|juː|v|i|.|aɪ|t|I|s}}) is inflammation of the [[uvea]], the pigmented layer of the [[eye]] between the inner [[retina]] and the outer fibrous layer composed of the [[sclera]] and [[cornea]].<ref name="nei">{{cite web |title=Uveitis |url=https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/uveitis |publisher=National Eye Institute, US National Institutes of Health |access-date=19 April 2023 |date=16 November 2021}}</ref> The uvea consists of the middle layer of pigmented [[vascular]] structures of the eye and includes the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], [[ciliary body]], and [[choroid]]. Uveitis is described anatomically, by the part of the eye affected, as anterior, [[intermediate uveitis|intermediate]] or posterior, or panuveitic if all parts are involved. Anterior uveitis ([[iridocyclitis]])  is the most common, with the incidence of uveitis overall affecting approximately 1:4500, most commonly those between the ages of 20-60. Symptoms include eye pain, eye redness, [[floater]]s and blurred vision, and ophthalmic examination may show dilated [[ciliary body|ciliary blood vessels]] and the presence of cells in the [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]]. Uveitis may arise spontaneously, have a genetic component, or be associated with an [[autoimmune disease]] or [[infection]]. While the eye is a relatively protected environment, its [[ocular immune system|immune mechanisms]] may be overcome resulting in [[inflammation]] and tissue destruction associated with [[T cell|T-cell]] activation.

Uveitis is an ophthalmic emergency that requires urgent control of the inflammation to prevent vision loss.  Treatment typically involves the use of topical eye drop [[glucocorticoid|steroids]], [[Intravitreal injection|intravitreal]] injection, newer [[Biologics for immunosuppression|biologics]], and treating any underlying disease. While initial treatment is usually successful, complications include other ocular disorders, such as [[uveitic glaucoma]], [[retinal detachment]], [[optic nerve]] damage, [[cataract]]s, and in some cases, [[Visual impairment|a permanent loss of vision]]. In the United States uveitis accounts for about 10%-20% of cases of blindness.

== Classification ==
Uveitis is classified anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis forms—based on the part of the eye primarily affected.<ref>Jabs DA, Nussenblatt RB, Rosenbaum JT. Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group. Standardization of uveitis nomenclature for reporting clinical data. Results of the First International Workshop. Am J Ophthalmol 2005;140:509-516.</ref> Before the twentieth century, uveitis was typically referred to in English as "ophthalmia."<ref name="JAMA Ophthalmol">{{cite journal |vauthors=Leffler CT, Schwartz SG, Stackhouse R, Davenport B, Spetzler K |date=December 2013 |title=Evolution and impact of eye and vision terms in written English |url=http://oculistmd.wordpress.com/article/evolution-and-impact-of-eye-and-vision-terms-in-written-english/ |url-status=live |journal=JAMA Ophthalmology |volume=131 |issue=12 |pages=1625–31 |doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.917 |pmid=24337558 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223122215/http://oculistmd.wordpress.com/article/evolution-and-impact-of-eye-and-vision-terms-in-written-english/ |archive-date=2014-12-23}}</ref>

* ''Anterior uveitis'' includes [[iridocyclitis]] and [[iritis]].  Iritis is the inflammation of the [[anterior chamber]] and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].  Iridocyclitis is inflammation of the iris and ciliary body with inflammation predominantly confined to the ciliary body.  Between 66% and 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location (iritis).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gueudry |first1=J. |last2=Muraine |first2=M. |date=January 2018 |title=Anterior uveitis |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0181551217304333 |journal=Journal Français d'Ophtalmologie |language=en |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=e11–e21 |doi=10.1016/j.jfo.2017.11.003|pmid=29290458 }}</ref>  This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature.
* ''Intermediate uveitis'', also known as [[pars planitis]], consists of vitritis—which is inflammation of cells in the [[Vitreous body|vitreous]] cavity, sometimes with ''snowbanking'', or deposition of inflammatory material on the [[pars plana]]. There are also "snowballs," which are inflammatory cells in the vitreous.
* ''Posterior uveitis'' or [[chorioretinitis]] is the inflammation of the [[retina]] and [[choroid]].
* ''[[Panuveitis]]'' is the inflammation of all layers of the uvea.

== Causes ==
Uveitis is usually an isolated illness, but can be associated with many other medical conditions.<ref name=nei/> In anterior uveitis, no associated condition or syndrome is found in approximately one-half of cases. However, anterior uveitis is often one of the syndromes associated with [[HLA-B27]]. Presence of this type of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] allele has a [[relative risk]] of evolving this disease by approximately 15%.<ref name="Kumar5-7">Table 5-7 in: {{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Richard Sheppard |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |last2=Kumar |first2=Vinay |last3=Abbas |first3=Abul K. |last4=Fausto |first4=Nelson |publisher=Saunders |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |edition=8th |location=Philadelphia |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

The most common form of uveitis is acute anterior uveitis (AAU). It is most commonly associated with HLA-B27, which has important features: HLA-B27 AAU can be associated with ocular inflammation alone or in association with systemic disease. HLA-B27 AAU has characteristic clinical features including male preponderance, unilateral alternating acute onset, a non-granulomatous appearance, and frequent recurrences, whereas HLA-B27 negative AAU has an equivalent male to female onset, bilateral chronic course, and more frequent granulomatous appearance.<ref name="larson" /> Rheumatoid arthritis is not uncommon in Asian countries as a significant association of uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah IA, Zuberi BF, Sangi SA, Abbasi SA |year=1999 |title=Systemic Manifestations of Iridocyclitis |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8479372 |journal=Pak J Ophthalmol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=61–64}}</ref>

=== Infectious causes ===
Uveitis may be an immune response to fight an infection caused by an organism in the eye. They are less common than non-infectious causes and require antimicrobial/ viral/ parasitic treatment in addition to inflammatory control.  Infectious causes in order of global burden include:

*Several reports suggest the use of quinolones, especially [[Moxifloxacin]], may lead to uveitis.<ref name="JAMA_Ophthalmology">{{cite journal |vauthors=Eadie B, Etminan M, Mikelberg FS |date=January 2015 |title=Risk for uveitis with oral moxifloxacin: a comparative safety study |journal=JAMA Ophthalmology |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=81–4 |doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2014.3598 |pmid=25275293 |doi-access=}}</ref>

===White dot syndromes===
Occasionally, uveitis is not associated with a systemic condition: the inflammation is confined to the eye and has unknown cause. In some of these cases, the presentation in the eye is characteristic of a described syndrome, which are called [[white dot syndromes]], and include the following diagnoses:

*[[acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy]]
*[[birdshot chorioretinopathy]]
*[[multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis]]
*[[multiple evanescent white dot syndrome]]
*[[punctate inner choroiditis]]
*[[serpiginous choroiditis]]
*[[acute zonal occult outer retinopathy]]

===Masquerade syndromes===
Masquerade syndromes are those conditions that include the presence of intraocular cells but are not due to immune-mediated uveitis entities. These may be divided into neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.
*Non-neoplastic:
:*[[retinitis pigmentosa]]
:*intraocular foreign body
:*[[juvenile xanthogranuloma]]
:*[[retinal detachment]]
*Neoplastic:
:*[[retinoblastoma]]
:*[[lymphoma]]
:*[[malignant melanoma]]
:*[[leukemia]]
:*[[reticulum cell sarcoma]]

The disease course, anatomy, and laterality can vary widely and are important to consider in diagnosis and treatment. Cases may be acute (sudden onset with < 3 month duration) and monophonic, acute and recurrent, or chronic.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Burkholder |first1=Bryn M. |last2=Jabs |first2=Douglas A. |date=2021-02-03 |title=Uveitis for the non-ophthalmologist |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.m4979 |journal=BMJ |language=en |volume=372 |pages=m4979 |doi=10.1136/bmj.m4979 |issn=1756-1833 |pmid=33536186|s2cid=231775713 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The signs and symptoms of uveitis may include the following:<ref name=nei/>

===Anterior uveitis (iritis)===
* Pain in the eye(s)
* Redness of the eye(s)
* [[Blurred vision]]
* [[Photophobia]]
* Irregular pupil
* Signs of anterior uveitis include dilated [[Ciliary body|ciliary vessel]]s, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and [[keratic precipitate]]s ("KP") on the posterior surface of the [[cornea]]. In severe inflammation there may be evidence of a [[hypopyon]]. Old episodes of uveitis are identified by pigment deposits on lens, KPs, and festooned pupil on dilation of pupil.
*''Busacca nodules'', inflammatory nodules located on the surface of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] in [[granulomatous]] forms of anterior uveitis such as [[Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis]] (FHI).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Uveitis, Anterior, Granulomatous|author1=Abdullah Al-Fawaz|author2=Ralph D Levinson|date=25 Feb 2010|publisher=eMedicine from WebMD|access-date=15 December 2010|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1209505-overview|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204142852/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1209505-overview|archive-date=4 December 2010}}</ref>
* [[synechia (eye)|Synechia]], adhesion of the iris to the cornea (anterior synechiae) or more commonly the lens (posterior synechiae) 

===Intermediate uveitis===
Most common:
*[[Floaters]], which are dark spots that float in the visual field
* Blurred vision
Intermediate uveitis usually affects one eye. Less common is the presence of pain and photophobia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Babu BM, Rathinam SR | title = Intermediate uveitis | journal = Indian Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–7 | date = Jan–Feb 2010 | pmid = 20029143 | pmc = 2841370 | doi = 10.4103/0301-4738.58469 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Posterior uveitis===
Inflammation in the back of the eye is commonly characterized by:
* Floaters
* Blurred vision

==Pathophysiology==

===Immunological factors===
Onset of uveitis can broadly be described as a failure of the [[ocular immune system]] and the disease results from [[inflammation]] and tissue destruction. Uveitis is driven by the [[Th17]] T cell sub-population that bear [[T-cell receptor]]s specific for proteins found in the eye.<ref name="nian" /> These are often not deleted centrally whether due to ocular antigen not being presented in the [[thymus]] (therefore not negatively selected) or a state of anergy is induced to prevent self targeting.<ref name="lamb" /><ref name="avi" />

Autoreactive T cells must normally be held in check by the suppressive environment produced by [[microglia]] and [[dendritic cells]] in the eye.<ref name="forr" /> These cells produce large amounts of [[TGF beta]] and other suppressive [[cytokine]]s, including [[interleukin-10|IL-10]], to prevent damage to the eye by reducing inflammation and causing T cells to differentiate to inducible T reg cells. Innate immune stimulation by bacteria and cellular stress is normally suppressed by myeloid suppression while inducible [[Treg]] cells prevent activation and clonal expansion of the autoreactive [[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th17]] cells that possess potential to cause damage to the eye.

Whether through infection or other causes, this balance can be upset and autoreactive T cells allowed to proliferate and migrate to the eye. Upon entry to the eye, these cells may be returned to an inducible Treg state by the presence of IL-10 and TGF-beta from microglia. Failure of this mechanism leads to [[neutrophil]] and other [[leukocyte]] recruitment from the peripheral blood through [[interleukin 17|IL-17]] secretion. Tissue destruction is mediated by non-specific macrophage activation and the resulting cytokine cascades.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khera TK, Copland DA, Boldison J, Lait PJ, Szymkowski DE, Dick AD, Nicholson LB | title = Tumour necrosis factor-mediated macrophage activation in the target organ is critical for clinical manifestation of uveitis | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 168 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–77 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22471277 | pmc = 3390517 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2012.04567.x }}</ref> Serum [[TNF-alpha|TNF-α]] is significantly elevated in cases while [[interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[interleukin 8|IL-8]] are present in significantly higher quantities in the [[aqueous humour]] in patients with both quiescent and active uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valentincic NV, de Groot-Mijnes JD, Kraut A, Korosec P, Hawlina M, Rothova A | title = Intraocular and serum cytokine profiles in patients with intermediate uveitis | journal = Molecular Vision | volume = 17 | pages = 2003–10 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21850175 | pmc = 3154134 }}</ref> These are inflammatory markers that non-specifically activate local macrophages causing tissue damage.

===Genetic factors===
The cause of non-infectious uveitis is unknown but there are some strong genetic factors that predispose disease onset including HLA-B27<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakefield D, Chang JH, Amjadi S, Maconochie Z, Abu El-Asrar A, McCluskey P | title = What is new HLA-B27 acute anterior uveitis? | journal = Ocular Immunology and Inflammation | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–44 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21428757 | doi = 10.3109/09273948.2010.542269 | s2cid = 20937369 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Caspi RR | title = A look at autoimmunity and inflammation in the eye | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 120 | issue = 9 | pages = 3073–83 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20811163 | pmc = 2929721 | doi = 10.1172/JCI42440 }}</ref> and the PTPN22 genotype.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burn GL, Svensson L, Sanchez-Blanco C, Saini M, Cope AP | title = Why is PTPN22 a good candidate susceptibility gene for autoimmune disease? | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 585 | issue = 23 | pages = 3689–98 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21515266 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2011.04.032 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Infectious agents===
Recent evidence has pointed to reactivation of [[herpes simplex]], [[Varicella zoster virus|varicella zoster]] and other viruses as important causes of developing what was previously described as idiopathic anterior uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jap A, Chee SP | title = Viral anterior uveitis | journal = Current Opinion in Ophthalmology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 483–8 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21918442 | doi = 10.1097/ICU.0b013e32834be021 | s2cid = 42582137 }}</ref> Bacterial infection is another significant contributing factor in developing uveitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick AD | title = Road to fulfilment: taming the immune response to restore vision | journal = Ophthalmic Research | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–9 | date = 1 January 2012 | pmid = 22398563 | doi = 10.1159/000335982 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Uveitis is assessed as part of a [[Eye examination|dilated eye exam]].<ref name=nei/> Diagnosis includes [[dilated fundus examination]] to rule out posterior uveitis, which presents with white spots across the retina along with [[retinitis]] and [[vasculitis]].<ref name=nei/>

Laboratory testing is usually used to diagnose specific underlying diseases, including rheumatologic tests (e.g. antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor) and serology for infectious diseases (Syphilis, Toxoplasmosis, Tuberculosis).

[[Major histocompatibility complex|Major histocompatibility antigen]] testing may be performed to investigate genetic susceptibility to uveitis. The most common antigens include HLA-B27, HLA-A29 (in birdshot chorioretinopathy) and HLA-B51 (in Behçet disease).{{Citation needed|reason=Diagnosis section lacks references, HLA-B27 is referenced in genetic factors section, HLA-A29 and HLA-B51 are not|date=January 2020}}

Radiology X-ray may be used to show coexisting arthritis and chest X-ray may be helpful in sarcoidosis.

==Treatment==
Uveitis is typically treated with [[glucocorticoid]] [[steroid]]s, either as topical eye drops (prednisolone acetate) or as oral therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pato E, Muñoz-Fernández S, Francisco F, Abad MA, Maese J, Ortiz A, Carmona L | title = Systematic review on the effectiveness of immunosuppressants and biological therapies in the treatment of autoimmune posterior uveitis | journal = Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–23 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20656330 | doi = 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2010.05.008 }}</ref> Prior to the administration of corticosteroids, [[corneal ulcer]]s must be ruled out. This is typically done using a fluorescence dye test.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluorescein eye stain|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003845.htm|publisher=NIH|access-date=15 May 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520141436/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003845.htm|archive-date=20 May 2012}}</ref> In addition to corticosteroids, topical [[cycloplegic]]s, such as [[atropine]] or [[homatropine]], may be used. Successful treatment of active uveitis increases [[T-regulatory cell]]s in the eye, which likely contributes to disease regression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruggieri S, Frassanito MA, Dammacco R, Guerriero S | title = Treg lymphocytes in autoimmune uveitis | journal = Ocular Immunology and Inflammation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–61 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22564107 | doi = 10.3109/09273948.2012.681830 | s2cid = 23301939 }}</ref>
In severe cases an injection of posterior [[Tenon's capsule|subtenon]] [[triamcinolone]] acetate may also be given to reduce the swelling of the eye.

Intravitrial injection of steroid has proven to be a newer useful way to control inflammation for longer without the need for daily eyedrops. Dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide are two more commonly used options for noninfectious uveitis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=José-Vieira |first1=Rafael |last2=Ferreira |first2=André |last3=Menéres |first3=Pedro |last4=Sousa-Pinto |first4=Bernardo |last5=Figueira |first5=Luís |date=July 2022 |title=Efficacy and safety of intravitreal and periocular injection of corticosteroids in noninfectious uveitis: a systematic review |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039625721002228 |journal=Survey of Ophthalmology |language=en |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=991–1013 |doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2021.12.002|pmid=34896190 |s2cid=263477578 }}</ref>

Non-biologic, steroid sparing therapies for noninfectious uveitis in adults are now more available. These include the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and tacrolimus.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Edwards Mayhew |first1=Rebecca G |last2=Li |first2=Tianjing |last3=McCann |first3=Paul |last4=Leslie |first4=Louis |last5=Strong Caldwell |first5=Anne |last6=Palestine |first6=Alan G |date=2022-10-31 |editor-last=Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group |title=Non-biologic, steroid-sparing therapies for non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in adults |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |language=en |volume=2022 |issue=10 |pages=CD014831 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD014831.pub2 |pmc=9621106 |pmid=36315029}}</ref> In comparing various studies, methotrexate is more efficacious than mycophenolate in inflammatory control for most forms of panuveitis. Methotrexate also had little to no differences in safety outcomes compared to mycophenolate.<ref name=":1" />

[[Antimetabolite]] medications, such as [[methotrexate]] are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis.  Experimental treatments with [[Infliximab]] or other anti-TNF infusions may prove helpful.

The anti-diabetic drug [[metformin]] is reported to inhibit the process that causes the inflammation in uveitis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/81923/diabetes-drug-could-treat-leading-cause-of-blindness |title=Diabetes drug could treat leading cause of blindness |date=May 8, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616180817/http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/81923/diabetes-drug-could-treat-leading-cause-of-blindness |archive-date=June 16, 2012 }}</ref>

In the case of herpetic uveitis, anti-viral medications, such as [[valaciclovir]] or [[aciclovir]], may be administered to treat the causative viral infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inkling.com/read/albert-jakobiecs-principles-practice-ophthalmology-3rd/chapter-49/herpetic-disease-of-the|title=Unsupported Browser|last=Inkling|website=Inkling|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==

Uveitis affects approximately 1 in 4500 people and is most common between the ages 20 to 60 with men and women affected equally.  In western countries, anterior uveitis accounts for between 50% and 90% of uveitis cases. In Asian countries the proportion is between 28% and 50%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang JH, Wakefield D |date=December 2002 |title=Uveitis: a global perspective |journal=Ocular Immunology and Inflammation |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=263–79 |doi=10.1076/ocii.10.4.263.15592 |pmid=12854035 |s2cid=23658926}}</ref> Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10%-20% of the blindness in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gritz DC, Wong IG |date=March 2004 |title=Incidence and prevalence of uveitis in Northern California; the Northern California Epidemiology of Uveitis Study |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=491–500; discussion 500 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.06.014 |pmid=15019324}}</ref>

For non-infectious uveitis, women are more likely (57%) to be affected than men, possibly due to their higher prevalence of related [[autoimmune disease]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Joltikov |first1=Katherine A. |last2=Lobo-Chan |first2=Ann-Marie |date=2021-09-10 |title=Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Non-infectious Uveitis: A Systematic Review |journal=Frontiers in Medicine |volume=8 |pages=695904 |doi=10.3389/fmed.2021.695904 |issn=2296-858X |pmc=8461013 |pmid=34568364|doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Vitamin D deficiency]] and smoking are risk factors for non-infectious uveitis.<ref name=:0/>

==Prognosis==

The prognosis is generally good for those who receive prompt diagnosis and treatment, but serious complication including [[cataracts]], [[uveitic glaucoma]], [[band keratopathy]], [[macular edema]] and [[Visual impairment|permanent vision loss]] may result if left untreated. The type of uveitis, as well as its severity, duration, and responsiveness to treatment or any associated illnesses, all factor into the outlook.<ref name=nei/>
