<!--==History==
 removed uncited section
The lack of a cell wall conveys some unique properties of mycoplasmas such as sensitivity to osmotic shock and detergents, resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, and formation of fried-egg shaped colonies. Sections of mycoplasmas reveal that their cells are essentially built of three organelles: the cell membrane, ribosomes, and a circular double-stranded DNA tightly packed molecule. Their mode of replication is no different from that of other [[prokaryotes]] dividing by [[binary fission]]. For binary fission to happen, cytoplasmic division must fully synchronize with genome replication and in mycoplasma, cytoplasmic replication lags behind genome replication, which ultimately results in the formation of multinucleated filaments.

From ''in vitro'' cultivation of mycoplasmas, it has been discovered that they are "fastidious", i.e. difficult to cultivate. The reason for these difficulties for species such as ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' is the lack of all the genes involved in amino acid synthesis, making them dependent on exogenous supply of amino acids and other nutrients. This dependence on exogenous supplies of fatty acids and cholesterol serves as an advantage to conduct further studies on these organisms. In order to compensate for these deficiencies mycoplasmas are grown on complex media, usually consisting of beef heart infusion, peptone, yeast extract, and serum with various supplements.

Mycoplasmas' lack of a cell wall makes them good models for membrane studies. Due to this reason the availability of these membranes in pure state have enabled their chemical, enzymatic and antigenic characterization. The membrane is made of 60% to 70% protein with the remaining 20% to 30% being lipids.<ref name = "Razin">{{cite journal |vauthors=Razin S, Hayflick L | title = Highlights of mycoplasma research—An historical perspective | journal = Biologicals | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–90 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20149687 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.11.008 }}</ref>-->

===Important characteristics of ''Mycoplasma'' species===

# Cell wall is absent and [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]] forms the outer boundary of the cell.
# Due to the absence of cell walls these organisms can change their shape and leads to [[Pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]].
# Lack of nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
# Genetic material is a single [[DNA]] duplex and is naked.
# Ribosomes are [[Ribosome|70S]] type.
# Possess a replicating disc at one end which assists replication process and also the separation of the genetic materials.
# [[Heterotrophic nutrition]]. Some live as [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytes]] but the majority are parasites of plants and animals. The parasitic nature is due to the inability of mycoplasmal bacteria to synthesise the required growth factor.

=== Cell and colony morphology ===
Due to the lack of a rigid cell wall, ''Mycoplasma'' species (like all ''Mollicutes'')  can contort into a broad range of shapes, from round to oblong. They are [[Pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]] and therefore cannot be identified as rods, [[cocci]] or [[spirochetes]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clinical Microbiology made ridiculously simple|last1=Gladwin |first1=Mark|last2=Trattler |first2=William|last3=Mahan |first3=C.

=== Reproduction ===
In 1954, using phase-contrast microscopy, continual observations of live cells have shown that ''Mycoplasma'' species ("mycoplasmas", formerly called pleuropneumonia-like organisms, PPLO, now classified as ''Mollicutes'') and [[L-form bacteria]] (previously also called L-phase bacteria) do not proliferate by binary fission, but by a uni- or multi-polar [[budding]] mechanism. Microphotograph series of growing microcultures of different strains of PPLOs, L-form bacteria and, as a control, a Micrococcus species (dividing by binary fission) have been presented.<ref name=":0" />  Additionally, electron microscopic studies have been performed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kandler |first1=Gertraud |last2=Kandler |first2=Otto |author-link2=Otto Kandler |last3=Huber |first3=Oskar |date=1954 |others=(Article in English available) |title=Untersuchungen über die Morphologie und die Vermehrung der pleuropneumonie-ähnlichen Organismen und der L-Phase der Bakterien.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History of taxonomy ===
Previously, ''Mycoplasma'' species (often commonly called "mycoplasmas", now classified as ''[[Mollicutes]]'') were sometimes considered stable [[L-form bacteria]] or even viruses, but [[phylogenetic analysis]] has identified them as bacteria that have lost their cell walls in the course of evolution.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Woese |first1=Carl R. |author-link=Carl Woese |last2=Maniloff |first2=J. |last3=Zablen |first3=L.B. |date=1980 |title=Phylogenetic analysis of the mycoplasmas |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/77/1/494.full.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=494–498 |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.1.494 |pmid=692864|bibcode=1980PNAS...77..494W |doi-access=free }}</ref>
<!-- possible [[WP:COPYVIO]]The [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' (trivial name: mycoplasmas) and their close relatives are characterized by lack of a [[cell wall]], which makes them resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporin, and vancomycin, the major antigen determinants are their cell membrane glycolipids and proteins. Furthermore, the lack of cell walls (no peptidoglycan layer) is the reason that they are gram-negative. Despite this, the cells often present a certain shape, with a characteristic small size (it is the smallest free-living bacteria), with typically about 10% of the volume of an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell. These cell shapes presumably contribute to the ability of mycoplasmas to thrive in their respective environments. Most are [[Coccus|pseudococcoidal]], but there are notable exceptions. Species of the ''M. fastidiosum'' cluster are rod-shaped. Species of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', possess a polar extension protruding from the pseudococcoidal cell body. This tip structure, designated an attachment organelle or terminal organelle, is essential for adherence to host cells and for movement along solid surfaces (gliding motility) and is implicated in normal cell division. ''M. pneumoniae'' cells are pleomorphic, with an attachment organelle of regular dimensions at one pole and a trailing filament of variable length and uncertain function at the other end, whereas other species in the cluster typically lack the trailing filament. Other species like ''[[Mycoplasma mobile|M. mobile]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'' have similar structures with similar functions.

Mycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require [[sterols]] for the stability of their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small [[genome]] of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases, which results in drastically reduced biosynthetic capabilities and explains their dependence on a host. Additionally they use an alternate [[genetic code]] in which the [[codon]] UGA encodes the amino acid [[tryptophan]] instead of the usual [[stop codon]]. They have a low [[GC-content]] (23–40 [[Mole (unit)|mol]]).-->

These researchers succeeded by inoculating a semipermeable pouch of sterile medium with pulmonary fluid from an infected animal and depositing this pouch intraperitoneally into a live rabbit. After fifteen to twenty days, the fluid inside of the recovered pouch was opaque, indicating the growth of a microorganism. Opacity of the fluid was not seen in the control. This turbid broth could then be used to inoculate a second and third round and subsequently introduced into a healthy animal, causing disease. However, this did not work if the material was heated, indicating a biological agent at work. Uninoculated media in the pouch, after removal from the rabbit, could be used to grow the organism [[in vitro]], demonstrating the possibility of cell-free cultivation and ruling out viral causes, although this was not fully appreciated at the time.<ref name="Nocard_Roux_1898"/>-->

A recent focus in the sub-discipline of [[molecular phylogenetics]] has both clarified and confused certain aspects of the organization of the class ''Mollicutes''.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=((Johansson K-E)), Pettersson B | chapter = Taxonomy of Mollicutes | title=Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas (Razin S, Herrmann R, eds.)| pages=1–30 | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | location=New York |year = 2002 | isbn = 0-306-47287-2 }}</ref>

Originally, the [[Bacterial taxonomy#Vernacular names|trivial name]] "mycoplasmas" commonly denoted all members of the class [[Mollicutes]] (from Latin ''mollis'' "soft" and ''cutis'' "skin"), which lack cell walls due to their genetic inability to synthesize [[peptidoglycan]].

[[Taxonomists]] once classified ''Mycoplasma'' and relatives in the phylum [[Firmicutes]], consisting of low G+C [[Gram-positive bacteria]] such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus]]''; but modern polyphasic analyses situate them in the phylum [[Tenericutes]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Brown DR | chapter = Phylum XVI. Tenericutes Murray 1984a, 356VP | title=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Second Edition, Vol. 4, (Krieg NR, Staley JT, Brown DR, et al., eds.)| pages=567–568 | publisher = Springer | location=New York |year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-387-95042-6 }}</ref>

=== Historical approach to genera ===
Historically, the description of a bacterium lacking a cell wall was sufficient to classify it to the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and as such it is the oldest and largest genus of the class with about half of the class' species (107 validly described), each usually limited to a specific host and with many hosts harboring more than one species, some pathogenic and some commensal. In later studies, many of these species were found to be phylogenetically distributed among at least three separate orders. A limiting criterion for inclusion within the genus ''Mycoplasma'' was that the organism has a vertebrate host.

By the 1990s, it had become readily apparent that this approach was problematic: the [[type species]], ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'', along with other significant mycoplasma species like ''M. capricolum'', is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' in the order [[Entomoplasmatales]] than to the other members of the genus ''Mycoplasma''. As a result, if the group was to be rearranged to match phylogeny, a number of medically important species (e.g. ''M. pneumoniae'', ''M. genitalium'') would have to be put in a different genus, causing widespread confusion in medical and agricultural communities. The genus was discussed multiple times by the [[International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology]]'s (ICSB) subcommittee on Mollicutes between 1992 and 2011, to no effect.<ref name=LPSN/>

Regardless of taxonomy, by 2007 it is solidly known that Molicutes can be divided into four nontaxonomic lineages.<ref name="pmid17687503">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oshima K, Nishida H | title = Phylogenetic relationships among mycoplasmas based on the whole genomic information | journal = J.

* An "Acholeplasma" group consisting of [[Acholeplasmatales]]. This group is non-problematic, as it contains no species classified in what was then "Mycoplasma".
* A "[[Spiroplasma]]" or ''mycoides'' group containing ''M. mycoides'' and the aforementioned closely-related species in "Spiroplasma" and [[Entomoplasmatales]].
* A ''pneumoniae'' group containing ''M. pneumoniae'' and closely-related species (''[[Mycoplasma muris|M. muris]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma fastidiosum|M. fastidiosum]]'', ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum|U. urealyticum]]''), the currently unculturable [[haemotrophic mollicutes]], informally referred to as [[haemoplasmas]] (recently transferred from the genera ''Haemobartonella'' and ''Eperythrozoon''), and ''[[Ureaplasma]]''. This medically important group contains ''[[Mycoplasma alvi|M. alvi]]'' (bovine), ''[[Mycoplasma amphoriforme|M. amphoriforme]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma gallisepticum|M. gallisepticum]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma imitans|M. imitans]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma pirum|M. pirum]]'' (uncertain/human), ''[[Mycoplasma testudinis|M. testudinis]]'' (tortoises), and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' (human). Most, if not all, of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.
* A ''hominis'' group containing ''M. hominis'', ''[[Mycoplasma bovis|M. bovis]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'', among others.

=== Current taxonomy (Gupta) ===
In 2018, Gupta et al. re-circumscribed the genus ''Mycoplasma'' around ''M. mycoides''. A total of 78 species was removed from ''Mycoplasma'', creating five new genera and a number of higher taxonomic levels. Under this new scheme, a new family [[Mycoplasmoidaceae]] was created to correspond to the "pneumoniae" group, with ''M. pneumoniae'' and related species transferred to a new genus ''Mycoplasmoides''. Another new family [[Metamycoplasmataceae]] was created to correspond to the "hominis" group. Both families belong to a new order [[Mycoplasmoitales]], distinct from the [[Mycoplasmatales]] of ''Mycoplasma''.<ref name=Gupta18>{{cite journal| last1=Gupta|first1=R.S.| last2=Sawnani|first2=S.| last3=Adeolu|first3=M.| last4=Alnajar|first4=S.| last5=Oren|first5=A.| title=Phylogenetic framework for the phylum Tenericutes based on genome sequence data: proposal for the creation of a new order Mycoplasmoidales ord. nov., containing two new families Mycoplasmoidaceae fam. nov. and Metamycoplasmataceae fam. nov. harbouring Eperythrozoon, Ureaplasma and five novel genera| journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek| volume=111| issue=9| pages=1583–1630| year=2018| doi=10.1007/s10482-018-1047-3|pmid=29556819 |s2cid=254226604 }}</ref> The taxonomy was accepted by the ICSB with validation list 184 in 2018 and became the [[correct name]].

Gupta's proposed taxonomy, as expected, moved the medically important "pneumoniae" group out of ''Mycoplasma'' into its own genus. As a result, a number of mycoplasmologists petitioned to the ICSB to reject the name in 2019. They argue that although Gupta's phylogenetic methods were likely solid, the proposed name changes are too sweeping to be practically adopted, citing some principles of the Code such as "name stability".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Balish |first1=Mitchell |last2=Bertaccini |first2=A. |last3=Blanchard |first3=A. |last4=Brown |first4=D. |last5=Browning |first5=G.|last6=Chalker |first6=V.|last7=Frey |first7=J.|last8=Gasparich |first8=G.|last9=Hoelzle |first9=L.|last10=Knight |first10=T.|last11=Knox |first11=C.|last12=Chih-Horng |first12=K.|last13=Manso-Silván |first13=L.|last14=May |first14=M.|last15=Pollack |first15=J.D.|last16=Ramírez |first16=A.|last17=Spergser |first17=J.|last18=Taylor-Robinson |first18=D.|last19=Volokhov |first19=D.|last20=Zhao |first20=Y.|date= 2019|title=Recommended rejection of the names Malacoplasma gen. nov., Mesomycoplasma gen. nov., Metamycoplasma gen. nov., Metamycoplasmataceae fam. nov., Mycoplasmoidaceae fam. nov., Mycoplasmoidales ord. nov., Mycoplasmoides gen. nov., Mycoplasmopsis gen. nov.

== Laboratory contaminant ==
''Mycoplasma'' species are often found in research laboratories as contaminants in [[cell culture]]. Mycoplasmal cell culture contamination occurs due to contamination from individuals or contaminated cell culture [[Growth medium|medium]] ingredients.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Drexler HG |author2=Uphoff CC |title=Mycoplasma contamination of cell cultures: Incidence, sources, effects, detection, elimination, prevention |journal=Cytotechnology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=75–90 |date=2002 |doi=10.1023/A:1022913015916 |pmid=19003295 |pmc=3463982}}</ref> ''Mycoplasma'' cells are physically small – less than 1&nbsp; μm, so are difficult to detect with a conventional [[microscope]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Mycoplasmae may induce cellular changes, including [[chromosome]] aberrations, changes in [[metabolism]] and cell growth. Severe ''Mycoplasma'' infections may destroy a cell line. Detection techniques include [[DNA probe]], [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassays]], [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], plating on sensitive [[agar]] and staining with a [[DNA]] stain including [[DAPI]] or [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7637/|title=Mycoplasmas|last=Razin|first=S |publisher= The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|date=2001 |via=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |pmid= 21413254 |isbn=978-0-9631172-1-2|access-date= 8 July 2021}}</ref>

An estimated 11 to 15% of U.S. laboratory cell cultures are contaminated with mycoplasma.
A [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] study showed that half of U.S. scientists did not test for ''Mycoplasma'' contamination in their cell cultures. The study also stated that, in former Czechoslovakia, 100% of cell cultures that were not routinely tested were contaminated while only 2% of those routinely tested were contaminated (study p.&nbsp;6). Since the U.S. contamination rate was based on a study of companies that routinely checked for ''Mycoplasma'', the actual contamination rate may be higher. European contamination rates are higher and that of other countries are higher still (up to 80% of Japanese cell cultures).<ref name=Corning>{{cite news | author = John Ryan | title = Understanding and Managing Cell Culture Contamination | page = 24 | publisher = Corning Incorporated | year = 2008 | url = http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf | access-date = 4 August 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708193101/http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf | archive-date = 8 July 2011 }}</ref>

The majority of these ''Mycoplasma'' species have shown a strong correlation to [[malignant transformation]] in mammalian cells ''[[in vitro]]''.

==== ''Mycoplasma'' infection and host cell transformation ====

The presence of ''Mycoplasma'' was first reported in samples of cancer tissue in the 1960s.<ref name="pmid7479753" /> Since then, several studies tried to find and prove the connection between ''Mycoplasma'' and cancer, as well as how the bacterium might be involved in the formation of cancer.<ref name="pmid22076306" /> Several studies have shown that cells that are chronically infected with the bacteria go through a multistep transformation. The changes caused by chronic mycoplasmal infections occur gradually and are both [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[genetics|genetic]].<ref name="pmid22076306" /> The first visual sign of infection is when the cells gradually shift from their normal form to sickle-shaped. They also become [[hyperchromatic]] due to an increase of DNA in the nucleus of the cells. In later stages, the cells lose the need for solid support to grow and proliferate,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lopes|first1=B. R. P.|last2=Ribeiro|first2=A. G.|last3=Silva|first3=T.

==== Possible intracellular mechanisms of mycoplasmal malignant transformation ====

=====Karyotypic changes related to mycoplasma infections=====

Cells infected with ''Mycoplasma'' for an extended period of time show significant chromosomal abnormalities. These include the addition of chromosomes, the loss of entire chromosomes, partial loss of chromosomes, and [[chromosomal translocation]]. All of these genetic abnormalities may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. Chromosomal translocation and extra chromosomes help create abnormally high activity of certain [[proto-oncogenes]], which caused by these genetic abnormalities and include those encoding [[c-myc]], [[HRAS]],<ref name="pmid 11575494 "/> and [[vav (protein)|vav]].<ref name="pmid22076306" /> The activity of proto-oncogenes is not the only cellular function that is affected; tumour suppressor genes are affected by the chromosomal changes induced by mycoplasma, as well. Partial or complete loss of chromosomes causes the loss of important genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.<ref name="pmid7479753" /> Two genes whose activities are markedly decreased during chronic infections with mycoplasma are the [[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]] and the [[p53]] tumour suppressor genes.<ref name="pmid22076306" /> Another possible mechanism of carcinogenesis is [[RAC1]] activation by a small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma.<ref name=" pmid = 24172987 ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu X, Yu J, Zhou X, Li Z, Xia Y, Luo Z, Wu Y | title = A small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma promotes tumor cell migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3. | journal = Mol Med Rep | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–179 | date = Jan 2014 | pmid = 24172987 | url = http://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/9/1/173 | doi=10.3892/mmr.2013.1766| doi-access = free }}</ref> A major feature that differentiates mycoplasmas from other carcinogenic pathogens is that the mycoplasmas do not cause the cellular changes by insertion of their own genetic material into the host cell.<ref name="pmid 11575494 "/> The exact mechanism by which the bacterium causes the changes is not yet known.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

=====Partial reversibility of malignant transformations=====

The malignant transformation induced by ''Mycoplasma'' species is also different from that caused by other pathogens in that the process is reversible. The state of reversal is, however, only possible up to a certain point during the infection. The window of time when reversibility is possible varies greatly; it depends primarily on the ''Mycoplasma'' involved. In the case of ''M. fermentans'', the transformation is reversible until around week 11 of infection and starts to become irreversible between weeks 11 and 18.<ref name="pmid7479753" /> If the bacteria are killed using [[antibiotics]]<ref name="pmid7479753" /> (i.e. [[ciprofloxacin]]<ref name="pmid22076306" /> or [[Clarithromycin]]<ref name="pmid15708077">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pehlivan M, Pehlivan S, Onay H, Koyuncuoglu M, Kirkali Z | title = Can mycoplasma-mediated oncogenesis be responsible for formation of conventional renal cell carcinoma? | journal = Urology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 411–414 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15708077 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2004.10.015 }}</ref>) before the irreversible stage, the infected cells should return to normal.

==== Connections to cancer ''in vivo'' and future research ====

Epidemiologic, genetic, and molecular studies suggest infection and inflammation initiate certain cancers, including those of the prostate. ''M. genitalium'' and ''M. hyorhinis'' induce malignant phenotype in benign human prostate cells (BPH-1) that were not tumorigenic after 19 weeks of exposure.

==== Types of cancer associated with ''Mycoplasma'' ====

[[Colon cancer]]: In a study to understand the effects of ''Mycoplasma'' contamination on the quality of cultured human colon cancer cells, a positive correlation was found between the number of ''M. hyorhinis'' cells present in the sample and the percentage of CD133-positive cells (a glycoprotein with an unknown function).<ref name="pmid 20353562">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mariotti E, Gemei M, Mirabelli P, D'Alessio F, Di Noto R, Fortunato G, Del Vecchio L | title = The percentage of CD133+ cells in human colorectal cancer cell lines is influenced by Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 10 | pages = 120–125 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20353562 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-10-120 | pmc=2854114 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Gastric cancer]]: Strong evidence indicates the infection of ''M. hyorhinis'' contributes to the development of cancer within the stomach and increases the likelihood of malignant cancer cell development.<ref name="pmid21062494">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang H, Qu L, Ma H, Chen L, Liu W, Liu C, Meng L, Wu J, Shou C | title = Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection in gastric carcinoma and its effects on the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer cells | journal = BMC Gastroenterology | volume = 10 | pages = 132–140 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21062494 | doi = 10.1186/1471-230X-10-132 | pmc=2993648 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Lung cancer]]: Studies on lung cancer have supported the belief that more than a coincidental positive correlation exists between the appearance of ''Mycoplasma'' strains in patients and the infection with tumorigenesis.<ref name="pmid21999143">{{cite journal |vauthors=Apostolou P, Tsantsaridou A, Papasotiriou I, Toloudi M, Chatziioannou M, Giamouzis G | title = Bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples | journal = Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery | volume = 6 | page = 137 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21999143 | doi = 10.1186/1749-8090-6-137 | pmc=3212932 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Prostate cancer]]: p37, a protein encoded for by ''M. hyorhinis'', has been found to promote the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The protein also causes the growth, morphology, and gene expression of the cells to change, causing them to become a more aggressive phenotype.<ref name="pmid21663671">{{cite journal |vauthors=Urbanek C, Goodison S, Chang M, Porvasnik S, Sakamoto N, Li CZ, Boehlein SK, Rosser CJ | title = Detection of antibodies directed at M. hyorhinis p37 in the serum of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 233–238 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21663671 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2407-11-233 | pmc=3129326 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Renal cancer]]: Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) exhibited a significantly high amount of Mycoplasma sp. compared with the healthy control group. This suggests ''Mycoplasma'' may play a role in the development of RCC.<ref name="pmid15708077"/>
