{{Gastrointestinal tract sidebar}}
The '''stomach''' is a muscular, [[hollow organ]] in the [[upper gastrointestinal tract]] of humans and many other animals, including several [[invertebrate]]s. The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital organ in the [[digestive system]]. The stomach is involved in the [[gastric phase|gastric phase of digestion]], following the [[cephalic phase]] in which the sight and smell of food and the act of [[chewing]] are stimuli.  In the stomach a chemical breakdown of food takes place by means of secreted  [[digestive enzyme]]s and [[gastric acid]].

The stomach is located between the [[esophagus]] and the [[small intestine]].  The [[pyloric sphincter]] controls the passage of partially digested food ([[chyme]]) from the stomach into the [[duodenum]], the first and shortest part of the small intestine, where [[peristalsis]] takes over to move this through the rest of the intestines.

==Structure==
In the [[human digestive system]], the stomach lies between the [[oesophagus|esophagus]] and the [[duodenum]] (the first part of the [[small intestine]]). It is in the [[Quadrants and regions of abdomen#Quadrants|left upper quadrant]] of the [[abdominal cavity]]. The top of the stomach lies against the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]. Lying behind the stomach is the [[pancreas]]. A large double fold of visceral [[peritoneum]] called the [[greater omentum]] hangs down from the [[Curvatures of the stomach|greater curvature]] of the stomach. Two [[sphincter]]s keep the contents of the stomach contained; the [[oesophagus#Sphincters|lower esophageal sphincter]]  (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of the esophagus and stomach, and the [[pyloric sphincter]] at the junction of the stomach with the duodenum.

The stomach is surrounded by [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] (stimulant) and [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] (inhibitor) [[plexuses]] (networks of [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s in the [[anterior]] gastric, [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]], [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|superior]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|inferior]], celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.

The stomach is [[wikt:distensibility|distensible]], and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sherwood, Lauralee |title=Human physiology: from cells to systems |publisher=Wadsworth Pub.

The lesser curvature of the human stomach is supplied by the [[right gastric artery]] inferiorly and the [[left gastric artery]] superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region. The greater curvature is supplied by the [[right gastroepiploic artery]] inferiorly and the [[left gastroepiploic artery]] superiorly. The fundus of the stomach, and also the upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied by the [[short gastric arteries]], which arise from the splenic artery.

===Lymphatic drainage===
The two sets of [[gastric lymph nodes]] drain the stomach.

[[Image:Illu stomach2.jpg| thumb|right|The gastrointestinal wall of the human stomach]]
[[File:Layers of the GI Tract english.svg|thumb|Layers of the gastrointestinal wall of which the stomach is a dilated part]]

Like the other parts of the [[gastrointestinal wall]], the human stomach wall from inner to outer, consists of a [[mucosa]], [[submucosa]], [[muscular layer]], [[subserosa]] and [[serosa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Rochester medical center|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=34&contentid=17785-1|date=2020|access-date=2021-12-19|archive-date=2021-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050031/https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=34&contentid=17785-1|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The inner part of the stomach wall is the [[gastric mucosa]] a mucous membrane that forms the lining of the stomach. the membrane consists of an outer layer of [[columnar epithelium]], a [[lamina propria]], and a thin layer of [[smooth muscle]] called the [[muscularis mucosa]]. Beneath the mucosa lies the [[submucosa]], consisting of [[fibrous connective tissue]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stomach histology|url=https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/stomach-histology|access-date=2021-01-09|website=Kenhub|language=en}}</ref> [[Meissner's plexus]] is in this layer interior to the oblique muscle layer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gastrointestinal physiology : development, principles and mechanisms of regulation|last=Welcome, Menizibeya Osain|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-91056-7|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=628|oclc=1042217248}}</ref>

Outside of the submucosa lies the muscular layer. It consists of three layers of muscular fibres, with fibres lying at angles to each other. These are the inner oblique, middle circular, and outer longitudinal layers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-22 |title=22.5C: Muscularis |url=https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/22%3A_Digestive_System/22.05%3A_Layers_of_the_Alimentary_Canal/22.5C%3A_Muscularis |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=Medicine LibreTexts |language=en}}</ref> The presence of the inner oblique layer is distinct from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which do not possess this layer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SIU SOM Histology GI|url=http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/erg/stomach.htm|access-date=2021-01-09|website=www.siumed.edu|archive-date=2021-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210111015056/http://www.siumed.edu/~dking2/erg/stomach.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> The stomach contains the thickest muscular layer consisting of three layers, thus maximum peristalsis occurs here.
* The ''inner oblique layer:'' This layer is responsible for creating the motion that churns and physically breaks down the food. It is the only layer of the three which is not seen in other parts of the [[digestive system]]. The antrum has thicker skin cells in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the fundus.
* The ''middle circular layer:'' At this layer, the [[pylorus]] is surrounded by a thick circular muscular wall, which is normally tonically constricted, forming a functional (if not anatomically discrete) [[pyloric sphincter]], which controls the movement of [[chyme]] into the [[duodenum]]. This layer is concentric to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Axes|longitudinal axis]] of the stomach.
* The [[myenteric plexus]] (Auerbach's plexus) is found between the outer longitudinal and the middle circular layer and is responsible for the innervation of both (causing [[peristalsis]] and mixing).

The ''outer longitudinal layer'' is responsible for moving the semi-digested food towards the pylorus of the stomach through muscular shortening.

To the outside of the muscular layer lies a [[serosa]], consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the [[peritoneum]].

Smooth mucosa along the inside of the lesser curvature forms a passageway - the '''gastric canal'''  that fast-tracks liquids entering the stomach, to the pylorus.<ref name=Elsevier>{{citation |title=Gray's Anatomy |url=https://www.uk.elsevierhealth.com/grays-anatomy-9780702077050.html |publisher=Elsevier |edition=42nd |pages=1160–1163 |author-first=Susan |author-last=Standring}}</ref>

Within the body and fundus of the stomach lie the ''fundic glands''. In general, these glands are lined by column-shaped cells that secrete a protective layer of [[mucus]] and [[bicarbonate]]. Additional cells present include [[parietal cell]]s that secrete hydrochloric acid and [[intrinsic factor]], [[chief cell]]s that secrete [[pepsinogen]] (this is a precursor to pepsin- the highly acidic environment converts the pepsinogen to pepsin), and neuroendocrine cells that secrete [[serotonin]].<ref name=Dorland777/>{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Gene and protein expression ===
{{Further |Bioinformatics#Gene and protein expression}}
About 20,000 [[protein-coding genes]] are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal stomach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/stomach|title=The human proteome in stomach - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Uhlén|first1=Mathias|last2=Fagerberg|first2=Linn|last3=Hallström|first3=Björn M.|last4=Lindskog|first4=Cecilia|last5=Oksvold|first5=Per|last6=Mardinoglu|first6=Adil|last7=Sivertsson|first7=Åsa|last8=Kampf|first8=Caroline|last9=Sjöstedt|first9=Evelina|date=2015-01-23|title=Tissue-based map of the human proteome|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6220|pages=1260419|doi=10.1126/science.1260419|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25613900|s2cid=802377}}</ref> Just over 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the stomach compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific. The corresponding specific proteins expressed in stomach are mainly involved in creating a suitable environment for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients. Highly stomach-specific proteins include [[gastrokine-1]] expressed in the mucosa; [[pepsinogen]] and [[lipase]], expressed in [[gastric chief cell]]s; and a gastric [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|ATPase]] and [[gastric intrinsic factor]], expressed in [[parietal cell]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gremel|first1=Gabriela|last2=Wanders|first2=Alkwin|last3=Cedernaes|first3=Jonathan|last4=Fagerberg|first4=Linn|last5=Hallström|first5=Björn|last6=Edlund|first6=Karolina|last7=Sjöstedt|first7=Evelina|last8=Uhlén|first8=Mathias|last9=Pontén|first9=Fredrik|date=2015-01-01|title=The human gastrointestinal tract-specific transcriptome and proteome as defined by RNA sequencing and antibody-based profiling|journal=Journal of Gastroenterology|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=46–57|doi=10.1007/s00535-014-0958-7|pmid=24789573|s2cid=21302849|issn=0944-1174}}</ref>

==Development==
In the early part of the [[human embryogenesis|development of the human embryo]], the ventral part of the embryo abuts the [[yolk sac]]. During the third week of development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround parts of the yolk sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=LARSEN2009 /> The sac is surrounded by a network of [[vitelline arteries|vitelline arteries and veins]]. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the [[celiac artery]], [[superior mesenteric artery]], and [[inferior mesenteric artery]]. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the [[foregut]], [[midgut]], and [[hindgut]].<ref name=LARSEN2009 /> The surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and stomach form from the foregut.<ref name=LARSEN2009>{{cite book|author=Gary C. Schoenwolf |title=Larsen's human embryology|year=2009|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-443-06811-9|chapter=Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract|edition=4th}}</ref>

As the stomach rotates during early development, the dorsal and ventral mesentery rotate with it; this rotation produces a space anterior to the expanding stomach called the greater sac, and a space posterior to the stomach called the lesser sac. After this rotation the dorsal mesentery thins and forms the greater [[Greater omentum|omentum]], which is attached to the greater curvature of the stomach. The ventral mesentery forms the lesser omentum, and is attached to the developing [[liver]]. In the adult, these connective structures of omentum and mesentery form the [[peritoneum]], and act as an insulating and protective layer while also supplying organs with [[blood]] and lymph vessels as well as nerves.<ref name="SADLER">Sadler, T.W, (2011) Langman’s Medical Embryology (12th edition), LWW, Baltimore, MD</ref> Arterial supply to all these structures is from the [[celiac trunk]], and venous drainage is by the [[portal venous system]]. Lymph from these organs is drained to the prevertebral celiac nodes at the origin of the celiac artery from the [[aorta]].

==Function==
===Digestion===
{{Further|Human digestive system}}
{{See also|Gastric acid}}
In the [[human digestive system]], a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] (a small rounded mass of [[mastication|chewed up]] food) enters the stomach through the [[esophagus]] via the [[Esophagus#Sphincters|lower esophageal sphincter]]. The stomach releases [[proteases]] (protein-digesting [[enzyme]]s such as [[pepsin]]), and [[hydrochloric acid]], which kills or inhibits [[bacteria]] and provides the acidic [[pH]] of 2 for the [[protease]]s to work. Food is churned by the stomach through [[peristaltic]] muscular contractions of the wall – reducing the volume of the bolus, before looping around the fundus<ref>{{cite book |author1=Richard M. Gore |author2=Marc S. Levine. |title=Textbook of Gastrointestinal Radiology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA. |year= 2007|isbn=978-1-4160-2332-6}}</ref> and the [[body of stomach]] as the boluses are converted into [[chyme]] (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the [[pyloric sphincter]] and into the [[duodenum]] of the [[small intestine]], where the extraction of nutrients begins.

[[Gastric acid|Gastric juice]] in the stomach also contains [[pepsinogen]]. [[Hydrochloric acid]] activates this inactive form of enzyme into the active form, pepsin. Pepsin breaks down proteins into [[polypeptides]].

====Mechanical digestion====
Within a few moments after food enters the stomach, mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20 seconds. A mixing wave is a unique type of [[peristalsis]] that mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme. The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by more intense waves, starting at the body of the stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus. 

The pylorus, which holds around 30 mL of chyme, acts as a filter, permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly, but not fully, closed [[pyloric sphincter]]. In a process called [[gastric emptying]], rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum. Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it. The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force more chyme into the duodenum.

Gastric emptying is regulated by both the stomach and the duodenum. The presence of chyme in the duodenum activates receptors that inhibit gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being released by the stomach before the duodenum is ready to process it.<ref name="Openstax Anatomy & Physiology attribution">{{CC-notice|cc=by4|url=https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology/pages/23-4-the-stomach}} {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|title=Anatomy & Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|isbn=978-1-947172-04-3|date=September 13, 2023|at=23.4 The Stomach}}</ref>

====Chemical digestion====
The fundus stores both undigested food and gases that are released during the process of chemical digestion. Food may sit in the fundus of the stomach for a while before being mixed with the chyme. While the food is in the fundus, the digestive activities of [[salivary amylase]] continue until the food begins mixing with the acidic chyme. Ultimately, mixing waves incorporate this food with the chyme, the acidity of which inactivates salivary amylase and activates [[lingual lipase]]. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and diglycerides.

The breakdown of protein begins in the stomach through the actions of hydrochloric acid, and the enzyme [[pepsin]].

The contents of the stomach are completely emptied into the duodenum within two to four hours after the meal is eaten. Different types of food take different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in carbohydrates empty fastest, followed by high-protein foods. Meals with a high triglyceride content remain in the stomach the longest. Since enzymes in the small intestine digest fats slowly, food can stay in the stomach for 6 hours or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme. However, this is still a fraction of the 24 to 72 hours that full digestion typically takes from start to finish.<ref name="Openstax Anatomy & Physiology attribution"/>

=== Absorption ===
Although the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function of the small intestine, some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless does occur in the stomach through its lining. This includes:
* Water, if the body is [[Dehydration|dehydrated]]
* Medication, such as [[aspirin]]

The [[parietal cell]]s of the human stomach are responsible for producing [[intrinsic factor]], which is necessary for the absorption of [[vitamin B12]]. B12 is used in cellular metabolism and is necessary for the production of [[red blood cell]]s, and the functioning of the [[nervous system]].

=== Control of secretion and motility ===
[[Image:Stomach emptying into duodenum.svg|thumb|center|600px|Emptying of stomach chyme into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter]]

Chyme from the stomach is slowly released into the [[duodenum]] through coordinated [[peristalsis]] and opening of the pyloric sphincter. The movement and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both the [[autonomic nervous system]] and by the various [[Digestion#Digestive hormones|digestive hormones]] of the digestive system:

{| class="wikitable"
| [[Gastrin]] || The hormone ''gastrin'' causes an increase in the secretion of HCl from the parietal cells and pepsinogen from chief cells in the stomach. It also causes increased motility in the stomach. Gastrin is released by [[G cell]]s in the stomach in response to distension of the antrum and digestive products (especially large quantities of incompletely digested proteins). It is inhibited by a [[pH]] normally less than 4(high acid), as well as the hormone [[somatostatin]].
 |-
 | [[Cholecystokinin]] || ''Cholecystokinin'' (CCK) has most effect on the [[gall bladder]], causing gall bladder contractions, but it also decreases gastric emptying and increases release of [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] juice, which is alkaline and neutralizes the chyme. CCK is synthesized by I-cells in the mucosal epithelium of the small intestine.
 |-
 | [[Secretin]] || In a different and rare manner, ''secretin'', which has the most effects on the pancreas, also diminishes acid secretion in the stomach. Secretin is synthesized by [[S cell|S-cells]], which are located in the duodenal mucosa as well as in the jejunal mucosa in smaller numbers.
 |-
 | [[Gastric inhibitory polypeptide]] || ''Gastric inhibitory polypeptide'' (GIP) decreases both gastric acid release and motility. GIP is synthesized by K-cells, which are located in the duodenal and jejunal mucosa.
 |-
 | [[Enteroglucagon]] || ''Enteroglucagon'' decreases both gastric acid and motility.
 |-
 |}

Other than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action. This is in response to food products in the [[liver]] and gall bladder, which have not yet been absorbed. The stomach needs to push food into the small intestine only when the intestine is not busy. While the intestine is full and still digesting food, the stomach acts as storage for food.

===Diseases===
{{Main article|Stomach disease}}
A [[Upper gastrointestinal series|series of radiographs]] can be used to examine the stomach for various disorders. This will often include the use of a [[Upper gastrointestinal series|barium swallow]]. Another method of examination of the stomach, is the use of an [[endoscopy|endoscope]]. A [[gastric emptying study]] is considered the gold standard to assess the gastric emptying rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Masaoka|first1=Tatsuhiro|last2=Tack|first2=Jan|title=Gastroparesis: Current Concepts and Management|journal=Gut and Liver|date=30 September 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=166–173|doi=10.5009/gnl.2009.3.3.166|pmc=2852706|pmid=20431741}}</ref>

===Surgery===
In humans, many [[bariatric surgery]] procedures involve the stomach, in order to lose weight. A [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric band]] may be placed around the cardia area, which can adjust to limit intake. The [[Sleeve gastrectomy|anatomy of the stomach may be modified]], or the stomach may be [[Gastric bypass surgery|bypassed entirely]].

Surgical removal of the stomach is called a [[gastrectomy]], and removal of the cardia area is a called a '''cardiectomy'''.

==Other animals==
Although the precise shape and size of the stomach varies widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the esophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, [[lamprey]]s, [[hagfish]]es, [[chimaera]]s, [[lungfish]]es, and some [[teleost]] fish have no stomach at all, with the esophagus opening directly into the intestine. These animals all consume diets that require little storage of food, no predigestion with gastric juices, or both.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 345–349|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>

The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions, an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a posterior portion lined with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to [[mammal]]s, and even then are absent in a number of species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the esophagus. [[Ruminant]]s, in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are all lined with esophageal mucosa.<ref name=VB/>

In [[bird]]s and [[crocodilian]]s, the stomach is divided into two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the [[proventriculus]], lined by fundic glands, and connecting the true stomach to the [[crop (anatomy)|crop]]. Beyond lies the powerful muscular [[gizzard]], lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.<ref name=VB/>

In [[insect]]s, there is also a crop. The insect stomach is called the [[insect#Midgut|midgut]].

Information about the stomach in [[echinoderm]]s or [[mollusc]]s can be found under the respective articles.
