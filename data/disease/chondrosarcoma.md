==Symptoms and signs==
* Back or thigh pain
* [[Sciatica]]
* Bladder Symptoms
* Unilateral [[edema]]

==Causes==
The cause is unknown. There may be a history of [[enchondroma]] or [[osteochondroma]]. A small minority of secondary chondrosarcomas occur in people with [[Maffucci syndrome]] and [[Ollier disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Secondary chondrosarcoma|journal = The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|date = Oct 2010|issn = 1067-151X|pmid = 20889950|pages = 608–615|volume = 18|issue = 10|first1 = Patrick P.|last1 = Lin|first2 = Charbel D.|last2 = Moussallem|first3 = Michael T.|last3 = Deavers|doi = 10.5435/00124635-201010000-00004|s2cid = 25873835}}</ref>

Imaging studies – including [[radiographs]] ("x-rays"), [[computerized tomography]] (CT), and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) – are often used to make a presumptive [[diagnosis]] of chondrosarcoma.<ref>[http://www.claripacs.com/a.php?a=91 CT scan and gross pathology of a chondrosarcoma] 2012-12-18</ref> However, a definitive diagnosis depends on the identification of malignant cancer cells producing cartilage in a [[biopsy]] specimen that has been examined by a [[pathologist]]. In a few cases, usually of highly anaplastic tumors, [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) is required.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

There are no blood tests currently available to enable an oncologist to render a diagnosis of chondrosarcoma.  The most characteristic imaging findings are usually obtained with CT.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/chondrosarcoma/| title=Chondrosarcoma | website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 8 July 2021}}</ref>

Nearly all chondrosarcoma patients appear to be in good health. Often, patients are not aware of the growing tumor until there is a noticeable lump or pain. Earlier diagnosis is generally accidental when a patient undergoes testing for another problem and physicians discover cancer. Occasionally the first symptom will be a broken bone at the cancerous site. Any broken bone that occurs from mild trauma warrants further investigation, although there are many conditions that can lead to weak bones, and this form of cancer is not a common cause of such breaks.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the location of the disease and the aggressiveness of the tumors.<ref name="urlChondrosarcoma : Cancerbackup">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerbacup.org.uk/Cancertype/Bone/Typesofbonecancer/Chondrosarcoma#3340 |title=Chondrosarcoma : Cancerbackup |access-date=2009-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905213942/http://www.cancerbacup.org.uk/Cancertype/Bone/Typesofbonecancer/Chondrosarcoma#3340 |archive-date=2008-09-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Because chondrosarcomas are rare, they are treated at specialist hospitals with Sarcoma Centers.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Surgery is the main form of treatment for chondrosarcoma.  Musculoskeletal tumor specialists or orthopedic oncologists are usually chosen to treat chondrosarcoma, unless it is located in the skull, spine, or chest cavity, in which case, a neurosurgeon or thoracic surgeon experienced with sarcomas is chosen.  Often, a [[limb-sparing techniques|limb-sparing operation]] can be performed, but in some cases amputation is unavoidable.  Amputation of the [[arm]], [[leg]], [[jaw]], or half of the [[pelvis]] (called a [[hemipelvectomy]]) may be necessary in some cases.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

There are two kinds of hemipelvectomy – internal and external.
*  External hemipelvectomy – is removal of that half of the pelvis with the amputation of the leg.   It is also called hindquarter amputation.
*  Internal hemipelvectomy – is removal of that half of the pelvis,  but the leg is left intact.

Amputation at the hip is called hip disarticulation and amputees who have had this amputation are also called hip disartics.

Chemotherapy or traditional radiotherapy are not very effective for most chondrosarcomas, although [[proton therapy]] is showing promise with local tumor control at over 80%.<ref name="urlProton Therapy at PSI (Protonentherapie)">{{cite web |url=http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/klinikerfahrung.html |title=Proton Therapy at PSI (Protonentherapie) |access-date=2009-02-14}}</ref>

Complete surgical ablation is the most effective treatment, but sometimes this is difficult. [[Proton therapy]] radiation can be useful in awkward locations to make surgery more effective.

Recent studies have shown that induction of [[apoptosis]] in high-grade chondrosarcoma, both directly and by enhancement of response to [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]], is a valid therapeutic strategy.<ref name="JamilHowie">Jamil N, Howie S, Salter DM. Therapeutic molecular targets in human chondrosarcoma .Int J Exp Pathol 2010; 91:387–93</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends on how early the cancer is discovered and treated.  For the least aggressive grade, about 90% of patients survive more than five years after diagnosis. People usually have a good survival rate at the low-grade volume of cancer.<ref name="urlChondrosarcoma: Overview - eMedicine Radiology"/>  For the most aggressive grade, only 10% of patients will survive one year. Tumors may recur in the future.  Follow up scans are extremely important for chondrosarcoma to make sure there has been no recurrence or metastasis, which usually occurs in the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Limaiem F, Davis D, Sticco K |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538132/| title=Chondrosarcoma
