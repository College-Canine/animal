'''Cerebellar abiotrophy''' (CA),  also called '''cerebellar cortical abiotrophy''' (CCA), is a [[Genetics|genetic]] [[neurology|neurological]] disease in animals, best known to affect certain breeds of [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. It can also develop in humans. It develops when the [[neuron]]s known as [[Purkinje cell]]s, located in the [[cerebellum]] of the [[brain]], begin to die off.  These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain.  The [[Cerebellum#Purkinje layer|Purkinje layer]] allows communication between the [[Cerebellum#Cortical layers|granular and molecular cortical layers]] in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult.  People with damage to the cerebellum can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cerebellar_degeneration/cerebellar_degeneration.htm NINDS Cerebellar Degeneration Information Page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218075325/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cerebellar_degeneration/cerebellar_degeneration.htm# |date=2015-02-18 }}, ''National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke'', accessed May 5, 2016</ref>

''Abiotrophy'' means the loss of a vital [[nutrition|nutritive]] factor.  The cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] metabolic defect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandy J, Slocombe R, Mitten R, Jedwab D |title=Cerebellar abiotrophy in a family of Border Collie dogs |journal=Veterinary Pathology |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=736–738 |year=2002 |pmid=12450206 |doi=10.1354/vp.39-6-736|doi-access= }}</ref>

In most cases, the [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje neurons]] begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.

Cerebellar abiotrophy cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured.  [[Genetic testing]] can detect carriers.  In addition to dogs and horses, there also have been cases of cerebellar abiotrophy in [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and [[Domestic shorthair]] [[cat]]s; in [[Aberdeen Angus|Angus]], [[Polled Hereford]], [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] and [[Holstein (cattle)|Holstein Friesian]] [[cattle]]; [[Merino]] and [[Wiltshire Horn|Wiltshire]] [[sheep]]; and [[American Yorkshire pig|Yorkshire]] [[pig]]s.

==Terminology==
{{see also|Cerebellar hypoplasia (non-human)}}
The condition in [[Kerry Blue Terrier]]s is sometimes called ''progressive neuronal abiotrophy''.<ref>[http://www.uskbtc.com/article.php/63 Breed Information: Kerry Health] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115130247/http://www.uskbtc.com/article.php/63 |date=January 15, 2012 }}, ''United States Kerry Blue Terrier Club'', accessed November 6, 2011</ref>  Other terms used to describe the condition in dogs include cerebellar cortical atrophy and postnatal cerebellar cortical degeneration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetsci.usyd.edu.au/lida/index.php?Pg=7&DName=Cerebellar+abiotrophy&DID=476&Op=2 |author=Aitken, Sarah |title=Listing of Inherited Disorders in Animals; Disorder: Cerebellar abiotrophy |publisher=University of Sydney |access-date=March 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210181711/http://www.vetsci.usyd.edu.au/lida/index.php?Pg=7&DName=Cerebellar+abiotrophy&DID=476&Op=2 |archive-date=2008-12-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cerebellar abiotrophy in horses was originally thought to be a form of [[cerebellar hypoplasia (non-human)|cerebellar hypoplasia]] (CH) and was described as such in older research literature.  However, it was discovered that in horses, the die-off of purkinje cells began after the animal was born, rather than occurring ''[[Uterus|in utero]].''  Cerebellar hypoplasia is distinctly different in that it is a condition from a lack of these cells being formed during the development of the cerebellum. CH has been found in several species, including cats, dogs, cows and sheep.

There are other diseases that lead to [[cerebellar degeneration]], but the loss of Purkinje cells is a clear way to diagnose cerebellar abiotrophy, and the combination of clinical signs is sufficiently unique that cerebellar abiotrophy can easily be distinguished from other conditions, even in a living animal.

==Clinical signs==
Symptoms of cerebellar abiotrophy include [[ataxia]] or lack of balance, an awkward wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping [[horse gait|gait]], coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or, in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the [[brain]] [[post-mortem]] to determine if there has been a loss of Purkinje cells.<ref name=UCD>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/genomic/cerebellar/ |title=Cerebellar Abiotrophy<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-12 |archive-date=2008-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620012443/http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/genomic/cerebellar/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Most affected animals have normal intelligence and mildly affected animals can, in theory, live out a normal lifespan. However, affected animals are quite accident-prone, and for this reason many animals that develop cerebellar abiotrophy, particularly horses, are euthanized for humane reasons.  Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs.<ref name=UCD/>

In horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthanasia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point.  There also is some evidence that affected animals partially compensate for the condition by cognitively learning alternative methods for moving or to determine distance, and thus appear to improve because they become less accident-prone.

==Horses==
Cerebellar abiotrophy is best known as a condition affecting [[Arabian horse]]s.  It has also been observed in the [[Welsh pony and cob]], the [[Australian pony]],<ref name="PhAu">{{cite web |title=Practical Horse Genetics (Australia) |url=https://www.practicalhorsegenetics.com.au/index.php?test=cab |website=www.practicalhorsegenetics.com.au |access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref> [[Curly horse]],<ref name=Brault2011>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.2010.00349.x | volume=43 | issue=6 | title=The frequency of the equine cerebellar abiotrophy mutation in non-Arabian horse breeds | journal=Equine Veterinary Journal | pages=727–731 | author=Brault L. S.| year=2011 | pmid=21496100 }}</ref> [[Miniature horse]], the [[Gotland Pony]], one [[Eriskay Pony]], and possibly the [[Oldenburg (horse)|Oldenburg]].  Most foals appear normal at birth, with symptoms noticeable at an average age of four months, though there have been cases where the condition is first seen shortly after birth and other cases where symptoms are first recognized in horses over one year of age.

Breeds DNA tested that reveal some carrier lines, but to date no affected animals, include the [[Welsh pony]] and the [[Trakehner]]. However, other breeds heavily influenced by Arabian breeding, such as the [[Thoroughbred]] and the [[American Saddlebred]], do not appear to carry the mutation.<ref name=Brault2011/>

In horses, cerebellar abiotrophy is believed to be linked to an [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive gene]].  This means it is not sex-linked, and the allele has to be carried and passed on by both parents in order for an affected animal to be born. Horses that only carry one copy of the gene may pass it on to their offspring, but themselves are perfectly healthy—without symptoms of the disease.  Because it is recessive, the allele for cerebellar abiotrophy may pass through multiple generations before it is expressed.

Cerebellar abiotrophy is sometimes misdiagnosed.  Though the symptoms are quite distinguishable from other [[neurologic]]al conditions, it has been confused with [[Wobbler disease|Wobbler's syndrome]], [[equine protozoal myeloencephalitis]], and injury-related problems such as a [[concussion]].

A DNA test which identifies markers associated with cerebellar abiotrophy became available in 2008.<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=17589 Larson, Erica. "Researcher: Genetic Mutation Likely the Cause of Neurologic Disorder" ''The Horse'' online edition, January 23 2011, Article # 17589.]  Accessed February 28, 2011</ref>  The test was refined to identify the most likely mutations, and retesting of earlier samples based on an earlier indirect marker test developed by UCD,<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=12746&nID=17&src=RA Johnson, Robert S.

Researchers working on this problem include Drs. Cecilia Penedo and Leah Brault.  Dr. [[Ann T. Bowling]] made significant early contributions to the [[genetics]] research on cerebellar abiotrophy.

==Dogs==
Cerebellar abiotrophy has been seen in the [[Australian Kelpie]], [[Gordon Setter]], [[Border Collie]], [[Labrador Retriever]], [[Airedale Terrier]], [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], [[Scottish Terrier]], [[Kerry Blue Terrier]], [[Miniature Schnauzer]], [[Lagotto Romagnolo]], and other [[dog]] breeds.  Time of onset varies. In a few breeds, such as the [[Beagle]], [[Rough Collie]], and [[Miniature Poodle]], Purkinje cells begin to die off at or shortly before birth, and pups are born with symptoms or develop symptoms by three to four weeks of age.<ref name=Berry>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berry M, Blas-Machado U |title=Cerebellar abiotrophy in a miniature schnauzer |journal=Canadian Veterinary Journal |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=657–659 |year=2003 |pmid=13677598 |pmc=340240}}</ref>  Most breeds prone to the condition, such as the Kerry Blue Terrier, Border Collie, Australian Kelpie, and Labrador Retriever, begin showing symptoms between six and sixteen weeks of age.<ref name=Berry/> In a very few breeds, such as the [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], [[Old English Sheepdog]], [[Brittany Spaniel]], and Gordon Setter, symptoms do not appear until adulthood or even middle age.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buijtels J, Kroeze E, Voorhout G, Schellens C, van Nes J |title=Cerebellar cortical degeneration in an American Staffordshire terrier |journal=Tijdschrift voor Diergeneeskunde |volume=131 |issue=14–15 |pages=518–522 |year=2006 |pmid=16916197}}</ref>

In dogs, cerebellar abiotrophy is also usually an autosomal recessive gene, but in a few breeds, such as the [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], the gene is [[sex linkage|sex-linked]].
