<!-- Treatment-->
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is typically treated initially with [[chemotherapy]] aimed at bringing about [[remission (medicine)|remission]].<ref name=NEJM2015/> This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years.<ref name=NEJM2015/> Treatment usually also includes [[intrathecal chemotherapy]] since systemic chemotherapy can have limited penetration into the central nervous system and the central nervous system is a common site for relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pui|first1=Ching-Hon|last2=Evans|first2=William E.|date=12 January 2006|title=Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|url=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra052603|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=2|pages=166–178|doi=10.1056/NEJMra052603|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16407512}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Richard A.|date=2 January 2018|title=Managing CNS disease in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10428194.2017.1326597|journal=Leukemia & Lymphoma|volume=59|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1080/10428194.2017.1326597|issn=1042-8194|pmid=28535095|s2cid=24564241}}</ref>

Treatment can also include [[radiation therapy]] if spread to the [[brain]] has occurred.<ref name="NEJM2015" /> [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|Stem cell transplantation]] may be used if the disease recurs following standard treatment.<ref name="NEJM2015" /> Additional treatments such as [[Chimeric antigen receptor T cell]] [[immunotherapy]] are being used and further studied.<ref name="NEJM2015" />

[[File:Diagram showing the cell that ALL starts in CRUK 295.svg|thumb|right|In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoid cell development stops at the lymphoblast (arrow), which are also overproduced.]]

The cancerous cell in ALL is the lymphoblast. Normal lymphoblasts develop into mature, infection-fighting B-cells or T-cells, also called [[lymphocyte]]s. Signals in the body control the number of lymphocytes so neither too few nor too many are made. In ALL, both the normal development of some lymphocytes and the control over the number of lymphoid cells become defective.<ref name="Inaba2013" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Terwilliger T, Abdul-Hay M | title = Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a comprehensive review and 2017 update | journal = Blood Cancer Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = e577 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28665419 | pmc = 5520400 | doi = 10.1038/bcj.2017.53 }}</ref>

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia emerges when a single lymphoblast gains many [[mutation]]s to [[gene]]s that affect [[blood cell]] development and proliferation. In childhood ALL, this process begins at conception with the inheritance of some of these genes. These genes, in turn, increase the risk that more mutations will occur in developing lymphoid cells. Certain genetic syndromes, like [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]], have the same effect. Environmental risk factors are also needed to help create enough genetic mutations to cause disease. Evidence for the role of the environment is seen in childhood ALL among twins, where only 10–15% of both [[Identical twins|genetically identical twins]] get ALL. Since they have the same genes, different environmental exposures explain why one twin gets ALL and the other does not.<ref name="Inaba2013" />

Infant ALL is a rare variant that occurs in babies less than one year old. ''[[KMT2A]]'' (formerly ''MLL'') gene rearrangements are most common and occur in the embryo or fetus before birth.<ref name="Inaba2013" /> These rearrangements result in increased expression of blood cell development genes by promoting gene transcription and through [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer C, Hofmann J, Burmeister T, Gröger D, Park TS, Emerenciano M, Pombo de Oliveira M, Renneville A, Villarese P, Macintyre E, Cavé H, Clappier E, Mass-Malo K, Zuna J, Trka J, De Braekeleer E, De Braekeleer M, Oh SH, Tsaur G, Fechina L, van der Velden VH, van Dongen JJ, Delabesse E, Binato R, Silva ML, Kustanovich A, Aleinikova O, Harris MH, Lund-Aho T, Juvonen V, Heidenreich O, Vormoor J, Choi WW, Jarosova M, Kolenova A, Bueno C, Menendez P, Wehner S, Eckert C, Talmant P, Tondeur S, Lippert E, Launay E, Henry C, Ballerini P, Lapillone H, Callanan MB, Cayuela JM, Herbaux C, Cazzaniga G, Kakadiya PM, Bohlander S, Ahlmann M, Choi JR, Gameiro P, Lee DS, Krauter J, Cornillet-Lefebvre P, Te Kronnie G, Schäfer BW, Kubetzko S, Alonso CN, zur Stadt U, Sutton R, Venn NC, Izraeli S, Trakhtenbrot L, Madsen HO, Archer P, Hancock J, Cerveira N, Teixeira MR, Lo Nigro L, Möricke A, Stanulla M, Schrappe M, Sedék L, Szczepański T, Zwaan CM, Coenen EA, van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM, Strehl S, Dworzak M, Panzer-Grümayer R, Dingermann T, Klingebiel T, Marschalek R | title = The MLL recombinome of acute leukemias in 2013 | journal = Leukemia | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2165–76 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23628958 | pmc = 3826032 | doi = 10.1038/leu.2013.135 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benedikt A, Baltruschat S, Scholz B, Bursen A, Arrey TN, Meyer B, Varagnolo L, Müller AM, Karas M, Dingermann T, Marschalek R | title = The leukemogenic AF4-MLL fusion protein causes P-TEFb kinase activation and altered epigenetic signatures | journal = Leukemia | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–44 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21030982 | doi = 10.1038/leu.2010.249 | s2cid = 6045674 | doi-access =  }}</ref> In contrast to childhood ALL, environmental factors are not thought to play a significant role. Aside from the ''KMT2A'' rearrangement, only one extra mutation is typically found.<ref name="Inaba2013" /> Environmental exposures are not needed to help create more mutations.

=== Risk factors ===

==== Genetics ====

Common inherited risk factors include mutations in ''[[ARID5B]]'', ''[[CDKN2A]]/[[CDKN2B|2B]]'', ''[[CEBPE]]'', ''[[IKZF1]]'', ''[[GATA3]]'', ''[[PIP4K2A]]'' and, more rarely, ''[[TP53]]''. These genes play important roles in cellular development, proliferation, and differentiation.<ref name="Vora2017"/><ref name="Inaba2013" /><ref name="NEJM2015" /> Individually, most of these mutations are low risk for ALL. Significant risk of disease occurs when a person inherits several of these mutations together.<ref name="Inaba2013" />

The uneven distribution of genetic risk factors may help explain differences in disease rates among ethnic groups. For instance, the ''ARID5B'' mutation is less common in ethnic African populations.<ref name="Inaba2013" />

Several genetic syndrome also carry increased risk of ALL. These include: [[Down syndrome]], [[Fanconi anemia]], [[Bloom syndrome]], [[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]], [[severe combined immunodeficiency]], [[Shwachman–Diamond syndrome]], [[Kostmann syndrome]], [[neurofibromatosis type 1]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]], [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]], and [[Li–Fraumeni syndrome]].<ref name="NelsonTbPeds19e" /> Fewer than 5% of cases are associated with a known genetic syndrome.<ref name="Paul 1645–1666"/>

Rare mutations in ''ETV6'' and ''[[PAX5]]'' are associated with a familial form of ALL with [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] patterns of [[Heredity|inheritance]].<ref name="NEJM2015" />

==== Environmental ====

The environmental exposures that contribute to emergence of ALL is contentious and a subject of ongoing debate.<ref name="Vora2017" /><ref name="Inaba2013" />

High levels of radiation exposure from nuclear fallout is a known risk factor for developing leukemia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Preston DL, Kusumi S, Tomonaga M, Izumi S, Ron E, Kuramoto A, Kamada N, Dohy H, Matsuo T, Matsuo T | title = Cancer incidence in atomic bomb survivors.

This result is questioned as no causal mechanism linking electromagnetic radiation with cancer is known.<ref name="Vora2017" /><ref name="Inaba2013" />

High birth weight (greater than 4000&nbsp;g or 8.8&nbsp;lbs) is also associated with a small increased risk. The mechanism connecting high birth weight to ALL is also not known.<ref name="Vora2017" />

Evidence suggests that [[Neoplasm#Types|secondary leukemia]] can develop in individuals treated with certain types of chemotherapy, such as [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s and [[cyclophosphamide]].<ref name="Vora2017" /><ref name=smith>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MA, Rubinstein L, Anderson JR, Arthur D, Catalano PJ, Freidlin B, Heyn R, Khayat A, Krailo M, Land VJ, Miser J, Shuster J, Vena D | title = Secondary leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome after treatment with epipodophyllotoxins | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 569–77 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10080601 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.2.569 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

==== Infections ====
There is some evidence that a common infection, such as [[influenza]], may indirectly promote the emergence of ALL.<ref name="Vora2017" /><ref name="Inaba2013" /> The delayed-infection hypothesis states that ALL results from an abnormal immune response to infection in a person with genetic risk factors. Delayed development of the immune system due to limited disease exposure may result in excessive production of lymphocytes and increased mutation rate during an illness.  Several studies have identified lower rates of ALL among children with greater exposure to illness early in life. Very young children who attend daycare have lower rates of ALL. Evidence from many other studies looking at disease exposure and ALL is inconclusive.<ref name="Vora2017" /> Some researchers have linked the [[hygiene hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greaves M | title = A causal mechanism for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 471–484 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29784935 | pmc = 6986894 | doi = 10.1038/s41568-018-0015-6 }}</ref>

== Mechanism ==

Several characteristic genetic changes lead to the creation of a leukemic lymphoblast. These changes include [[chromosomal translocation]]s, [[Chromosomal rearrangement|intrachromosomal rearrangements]], changes in the number of chromosomes in leukemic cells, and additional mutations in individual genes.<ref name="NEJM2015" /> Chromosomal translocations involve moving a large region of DNA from one chromosome to another. This move can result in placing a [[Oncogene|gene]] from one chromosome that promotes [[cell division]] to a more actively [[Transcription (biology)|transcribed]] area on another chromosome. The result is a cell that divides more often. An example of this includes the translocation of ''[[Myc|C-MYC]]'', a gene that encodes a [[transcription factor]] that leads to increased cell division, next to the [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|immunoglobulin heavy]]- or [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light-chain]] gene [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], leading to increased ''C-MYC'' expression and increased cell division.<ref name="NEJM2015" /> Other large changes in chromosomal structure can result in the placement of two genes directly next to each other. The result is the combination of two usually separate proteins into a new [[fusion protein]]. This protein can have a new function that promotes the development of cancer. Examples of this include the ''[[ETV6]]''–''[[RUNX1]]'' fusion gene that combines two factors that promote blood cell development and the [[BCR (gene)|''BCR'']]-[[ABL (gene)|''ABL1'']] fusion gene of the [[Philadelphia chromosome]]. ''BCR''–''ABL1'' encodes an always-activated [[tyrosine kinase]] that causes frequent cell division. These mutations produce a cell that divides more often, even in the absence of [[growth factor]]s.<ref name="Inaba2013" /><ref name="NEJM2015" />

Other genetic changes in B-cell ALL include changes to the number of chromosomes within the leukemic cells. Gaining at least five additional chromosomes, called high hyperdiploidy, occurs more commonly. Less often, chromosomes are lost, called [[Hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia|hypodiploidy]], which is associated with a poorer prognosis. Additional common genetic changes in B-cell ALL involve non-inherited mutations to ''PAX5'' and ''IKZF1''.<ref name="NEJM2015" /> In T-cell ALL, ''[[LYL1]]'', ''[[TAL1]]'', ''[[TLX1]]'', and ''[[TLX3]]'' rearrangements can occur.<ref name="Inaba2013" />

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia results when enough of these genetic changes are present in a single lymphoblast. In childhood ALL, for example, one fusion gene translocation is often found along with six to eight other ALL-related genetic changes.<ref name="Inaba2013" /> The initial leukemic lymphoblast copies itself into an excessive number of new lymphoblasts, none of which can develop into functioning lymphocytes. These lymphoblasts build up in the bone marrow and may spread to other sites in the body, such as [[lymph node]]s, the [[mediastinum]], the [[spleen]], the [[testicle]]s, and the [[brain]], leading to the common symptoms of the disease.<ref name="NEJM2015" />

== Diagnosis ==

[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosing]] ALL begins with a thorough medical history, [[physical examination]], [[Full blood count|complete blood count]], and blood smears. While many symptoms of ALL can be found in common illnesses, persistent or unexplained symptoms raise suspicion of cancer. Because many features on the medical history and exam are not specific to ALL, further testing is often needed. A large number of white blood cells and lymphoblasts in the circulating blood can be suspicious for ALL because they indicate a rapid production of lymphoid cells in the marrow. The higher these numbers typically point to a worse prognosis.<ref>{{cite book |last = Collier |first = J.A.B |title = Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties, Third Edition |publisher = Oxford |year = 1991 |page = 810 |isbn = 978-0-19-262116-0 }}</ref> While white blood cell counts at initial presentation can vary significantly, circulating lymphoblast cells are seen on peripheral [[Blood film|blood smears]] in the majority of cases.<ref name=MDAnd2016>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=1772&sectionid=121896350 |title=The MD Anderson Manual of Medical Oncology | vauthors = Baljevic M, Jabbour E, O'Brien S, Kantarjian HM |date=2016|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education| veditors = Kantarjian HM, Wolff RA |edition=3|location=New York|chapter=Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|access-date=22 November 2017 }}</ref>

Brain and spinal column involvement can be diagnosed either through confirmation of leukemic cells in the lumbar puncture or through clinical signs of CNS leukemia as described above. Laboratory tests that might show abnormalities include blood count, kidney function, electrolyte, and liver enzyme tests.<ref name=Seiter2014/>

[[Histopathology|Pathological]] examination, [[cytogenetics]] (in particular the presence of [[Philadelphia chromosome]]), and [[immunophenotyping]] establish whether the leukemic cells are [[myeloblast]]ic (neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils) or lymphoblastic ([[B lymphocyte]]s or [[T lymphocyte]]s). [[Genetic testing|Cytogenetic testing]] on the marrow samples can help classify disease and predict how aggressive the disease course will be. Different mutations have been associated with shorter or longer survival. [[Immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemical]] testing may reveal [[Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase|TdT]] or [[Neprilysin|CALLA]] antigens on the surface of leukemic cells. TdT is a protein expressed early in the development of pre-T and pre-B cells, whereas [[Neprilysin|CALLA]] is an antigen found in 80% of ALL cases and also in the "blast crisis" of [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]].

=== Immunophenotyping <!-- might be beyond the scope of wikipedia - would appreciate any advice --> ===

In addition to cell morphology and cytogenetics, [[immunophenotyping]], a laboratory technique used to identify proteins that are expressed on their cell surface, is a key component in the diagnosis of ALL. The preferred method of immunophenotyping is through [[flow cytometry]]. In the malignant lymphoblasts of ALL, expression of [[terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase]] (TdT) on the cell surface can help differentiate malignant lymphocyte cells from [[reactive lymphocyte]]s, white blood cells that are reacting normally to an infection in the body. On the other hand, [[myeloperoxidase]] (MPO), a marker for the [[Myeloid leukemia|myeloid]] lineage, is typically not expressed. Because precursor B cell and precursor T cells look the same, immunophenotyping can help differentiate the subtype of ALL and the level of maturity of the malignant white blood cells. The subtypes of ALL as determined by immunophenotype and according to the stages of maturation.<ref name=MDAnd2016 />

=== Cytogenetics<!-- Thinking about taking this paragraph out. Potentially beyond the scope of Wikipedia. Alternatively can try to combine with WHO table --> ===

Cytogenetic analysis has shown different proportions and frequencies of genetic abnormalities in cases of ALL from different age groups. This information is particularly valuable for classification and can in part explain the different prognoses of these groups. In regards to genetic analysis, cases can be stratified according to [[ploidy]], a number of sets of chromosomes in the cell, and specific genetic abnormalities, such as [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]. Hyperdiploid cells are defined as cells with more than 50 chromosomes, while hypodiploid are defined as cells with less than 44 chromosomes. Hyperdiploid cases tend to carry a good prognosis while hypodiploid cases do not.<ref name=":0" /> For example, the most common specific abnormality in childhood B-ALL is the t(12;21) ''[[ETV6]]''–''RUNX1'' translocation, in which the ''[[RUNX1]]'' gene, encoding a protein involved in transcriptional control of [[Haematopoiesis|hemopoiesis]], has been translocated and repressed by the ''ETV6''–''RUNX1'' fusion protein.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhojwani D, Pei D, Sandlund JT, Jeha S, Ribeiro RC, Rubnitz JE, Raimondi SC, Shurtleff S, Onciu M, Cheng C, Coustan-Smith E, Bowman WP, Howard SC, Metzger ML, Inaba H, Leung W, Evans WE, Campana D, Relling MV, Pui CH | title = ETV6-RUNX1-positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: improved outcome with contemporary therapy | journal = Leukemia | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–70 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21869842 | pmc = 3345278 | doi = 10.1038/leu.2011.227 }}</ref>

=== Classification ===

'''French-American-British'''

Historically, prior to 2008, ALL was classified morphologically using the French-American-British (FAB) system that heavily relied on morphological assessment. The FAB system takes into account information on size, [[cytoplasm]], [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]], [[basophilia]] (color of cytoplasm), and [[Vacuole|vacuolation]] (bubble-like properties).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett JM, Catovsky D, Daniel MT, Flandrin G, Galton DA, Gralnick HR, Sultan C | title = Proposals for the classification of the acute leukaemias.

'''World Health Organization'''

In 2008, the World Health Organization classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was developed in an attempt to create a classification system that was more clinically relevant and could produce meaningful prognostic and treatment decisions. This system recognized differences in genetic, [[Immunophenotyping|immunophenotype]], molecular, and morphological features found through [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and [[molecular diagnostics]] tests.<ref name="Nathan_2014_8" />{{rp|1531–1535}}<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Hoffbrand's essential haematology | vauthors = Hoffbrand AV, Moss PA |isbn=9781118408636|edition=Seventh|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=910009732|date = 6 October 2015}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> This subtyping helps determine the prognosis and the most appropriate treatment for each specific case of ALL.

== Treatment ==

[[File:Pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy.jpg|thumb|Two girls with ALL demonstrating [[intravenous therapy|intravenous access]] for [[chemotherapy]]]]

The aim of treatment is to induce a lasting [[remission (medicine)|remission]], defined as the absence of detectable cancer cells in the body (usually less than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow) or the absence of minimal residue disease.

Over the past several decades, there have been strides to increase the efficacy of treatment regimens, resulting in increased survival rates. Possible treatments for acute leukemia include [[chemotherapy]], [[steroid]]s, [[radiation therapy]], intensive combined treatments (including [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow]] or [[stem cell]] transplants), targeted therapy, and/or growth factors.<ref name="BCDtargetedTherapy">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cordo V, Meijerink J | title = T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Roadmap to Targeted Therapies | journal = Blood Cancer Discovery | volume = 2 | pages = 19–31 |date=January 2021 | issue = 1 |doi = 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-20-0093 | pmid = 34661151 |pmc=8447273 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia|title=Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Information – Mount Sinai – New York|website=Mount Sinai Health System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803150421/https://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia|archive-date=3 August 2016|url-status=live|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref>

=== Chemotherapy ===

Chemotherapy is the initial treatment of choice, and most people with ALL  receive a combination of medications. There are no surgical options because of the body-wide distribution of the [[malignant cells]]. In general, cytotoxic chemotherapy for ALL combines multiple antileukemic drugs tailored to each person. Chemotherapy for ALL consists of three phases: remission induction, intensification, and maintenance therapy.

|-
| '''Remission induction'''
|Aim to:
* Rapidly kill most tumor cells
* Reduce leukemic blasts in the bone marrow to <5% and eliminate tumor cells from blood
* Induce absence of other signs and symptoms of the disease.

Must monitor closely for [[tumor lysis syndrome]] after initiating therapy

Monitoring initial response to treatment is important as failure to show clearance of blood or bone marrow blasts within the first two weeks of therapy has been associated with a higher risk of relapse
* May need to intensify treatment if remission is not induced

Start CNS prophylaxis and administer [[intrathecal chemotherapy]] via [[Ommaya reservoir]] or multiple lumbar punctures
| Combination of:
* steroids – [[prednisolone]] or [[dexamethasone]]
* [[vincristine]]
* [[asparaginase]] (better tolerance in people in pediatric care)
* [[daunorubicin]] (used in Adult ALL)

Central nervous system prophylaxis can be achieved via:<ref name="pmid20209620">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jabbour E, Thomas D, Cortes J, Kantarjian HM, O'Brien S | title = Central nervous system prophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: current and emerging therapies | journal = Cancer | volume = 116 | issue = 10 | pages = 2290–300 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20209620 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.25008 | s2cid = 13634096 }}</ref>

|-
| '''Consolidation/intensification'''
|Use high doses of chemotherapy to further reduce tumor burden
| Typical protocols use the following given as blocks (varies from 1–3 blocks depending on person's risk category) in different multi-drug combinations:
* vincristine
* [[cyclophosphamide]]
* cytarabine
* daunorubicin
* [[etoposide]]
* [[thioguanine]]
* [[mercaptopurine]]

Central nervous system relapse is treated with intrathecal administration of [[hydrocortisone]], methotrexate, and cytarabine.
|-
| '''Maintenance therapy'''
|Kill any residual cell that was not killed by remission induction and intensification regimens
* Can sometimes start immediately after remission induction and be interrupted by bursts of consolidation/intensification therapy
* Although such residual cells are few, they will cause relapse if not eradicated
* Length of maintenance therapy is three years for boys, two years for girls and adults
|Typical protocol would include:
* daily oral [[mercaptopurine]]
* weekly oral [[methotrexate]]
* monthly 5-day course of intravenous vincristine and oral corticosteroids
|}

Adult chemotherapy regimens mimic those of childhood ALL; however, are linked with a higher risk of disease relapse with chemotherapy alone. Two subtypes of ALL (B-cell ALL and T-cell ALL) require special considerations when it comes to selecting an appropriate treatment regimen in adults with ALL. B-cell ALL is often associated with cytogenetic abnormalities (specifically, t(8;14), t (2;8), and t(8;22)), which require aggressive therapy consisting of brief, high-intensity regimens. T-cell ALL responds to cyclophosphamide-containing agents the most.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/hp/adult-all-treatment-pdq|title=Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref>

=== Radiation therapy ===

Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy) is used on painful bony areas, in high disease burdens, or as part of the preparations for a [[bone marrow transplant]] (total body irradiation). In the past, physicians commonly utilized radiation in the form of whole-brain radiation for central nervous system prophylaxis, to prevent the occurrence and/or recurrence of leukemia in the brain. Recent studies showed that CNS chemotherapy provided results as favorable but with fewer developmental side effects. As a result, the use of whole-brain radiation has been more limited.

=== Immunotherapy ===

[[Chimeric antigen receptor]]s (CARs) have been developed as a promising [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]] for ALL. This technology uses a [[single chain variable fragment]] (scFv) designed to recognize the cell surface marker [[CD19]] as a method of treating ALL.

CD19 is a molecule found on all B-cells and can be used as a means of distinguishing the potentially malignant B-cell population. In this therapy, mice are immunized with the CD19 antigen and produce anti-CD19 antibodies. [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]] developed from mouse spleen cells fused to a myeloma cell line can be developed as a source for the cDNA encoding the CD19 specific antibody.<ref name="pmid23527958">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grupp SA, Kalos M, Barrett D, Aplenc R, Porter DL, Rheingold SR, Teachey DT, Chew A, Hauck B, Wright JF, Milone MC, Levine BL, June CH | title = Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells for acute lymphoid leukemia | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 368 | issue = 16 | pages = 1509–1518 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23527958 | pmc = 4058440 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1215134 }}</ref> The cDNA is sequenced and the sequence encoding the variable heavy and variable light chains of these antibodies are cloned together using a small [[peptide]] linker.

Inserting the DNA into the effector cell can be accomplished by several methods. Most commonly, this is done using a [[lentivirus]] that  encodes the transgene. Pseudotyped, self-inactivating lentiviruses are an effective method for the stable insertion of a desired transgene into the target cell.<ref name="pmid9811723">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zufferey R, Dull T, Mandel RJ, Bukovsky A, Quiroz D, Naldini L, Trono D | title = Self-inactivating lentivirus vector for safe and efficient in vivo gene delivery | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 72 | issue = 12 | pages = 9873–80 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9811723 | pmc = 110499 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.72.12.9873-9880.1998 }}</ref> Other methods include [[electroporation]] and [[transfection]], but these are limited in their efficacy as transgene expression diminishes over time.{{medcn|date=August 2023}}

The gene-modified effector cells are then transplanted back into the person. Typically this process is done in conjunction with a conditioning regimen such as [[cyclophosphamide]], which has been shown to potentiate the effects of infused T-cells. This effect has been attributed to making an immunologic space within which the cells populate.<ref name="Barrett_2014" /> The process as a whole result in an [[effector cell]], typically a T-cell, that can recognize a tumor cell [[antigen]] in a manner that is independent of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] and which can initiate a cytotoxic response.{{medcn|date=August 2023}}

=== Relapsed ALL ===
Typically, people who experience a relapse in their ALL after initial treatment have a poorer prognosis than those who remain in complete remission after induction therapy. It is unlikely that recurrent leukemia will respond favorably to the standard chemotherapy regimen that was initially implemented, and instead, these people should be trialed on reinduction chemotherapy followed by [[allogeneic bone marrow transplantation]]. These people in relapse may also receive [[blinatumomab]], as it has shown to increase remission rates and overall survival rates, without increased toxic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kantarjian H, Stein A, Gökbuget N, Fielding AK, Schuh AC, Ribera JM, Wei A, Dombret H, Foà R, Bassan R, Arslan Ö, Sanz MA, Bergeron J, Demirkan F, Lech-Maranda E, Rambaldi A, Thomas X, Horst HA, Brüggemann M, Klapper W, Wood BL, Fleishman A, Nagorsen D, Holland C, Zimmerman Z, Topp MS | title = Blinatumomab versus Chemotherapy for Advanced Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | language = EN | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 376 | issue = 9 | pages = 836–847 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28249141 | pmc = 5881572 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa1609783 }}</ref>

Low dose [[Palliative care|palliative]] radiation may also help reduce the burden of tumor inside or outside the central nervous system and alleviate some symptoms.{{medcn|date=August 2023}}

There has also been evidence and approval of use for [[dasatinib]], a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]]. It has shown efficacy in cases of people with Ph1-positive and [[imatinib]]-resistant ALL, but more research needs to be done on long-term survival and time to relapse.<ref name=":2"/>

=== Supportive therapy ===
Adding physical exercises to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematological malignancies like ALL may result in little to no difference in mortality, quality of life, and physical functioning.

== Prognosis ==

Prior to the development of chemotherapy regimens and hematopoietic stem cell transplant, children were surviving a median length of 3 months, largely due to either infection or bleeding. Since the advent of chemotherapy, the prognosis for childhood leukemia has improved greatly and children with ALL are estimated to have a 95% probability of achieving a successful remission after 4 weeks of initiating treatment. People in pediatric care with ALL in developed countries have a greater than 80% five-year survival rate. It is estimated that 60–80% of adults undergoing induction chemotherapy achieve complete remission after 4 weeks, and those over the age of 70 have a cure rate of 5%.<ref name="HoffbrandMoss2006" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutter JJ | title = Childhood leukemia | journal = Pediatrics in Review | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 234–41 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20516235 | doi = 10.1542/pir.31-6-234 | s2cid = 207170780 }}</ref>
[[File:Overall survival rates in pediatric and adult ALL patients.png|thumb|Graphs of overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years in people in pediatric care and adults with ALL]]

However, there are differing prognoses for ALL among individuals depending on a variety of factors:
* Gender: Females tend to fare better than males.
* Ethnicity: [[Whites|Caucasians]] are more likely to develop acute leukemia than [[African American|African-Americans]], [[Asian American|Asians]], or [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]]. However, they also tend to have a better prognosis than non-Caucasians.
* Age at diagnosis: children 1–10 years of age are most likely to develop ALL and to be cured of it. Cases in older people are more likely to result from chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., the Philadelphia chromosome) that make treatment more difficult and prognoses poorer. Older people are also likely to have co-morbid medical conditions that make it even more difficult to tolerate ALL treatment.
* White blood cell count at diagnosis of greater than 30,000 (B-ALL) or 100,000 (T-ALL) is associated with worse outcomes
* Cancer spreading into the [[central nervous system]] ([[brain]] or [[spinal cord]]) has worse outcomes.
* Morphological, immunological, and genetic subtypes
* Person's response to initial treatment and longer length of time required (greater than 4 weeks) to reach complete remission
* Early relapse of ALL
* [[Minimal residual disease]]
* [[Genetic disorder]]s, such as [[Down syndrome]], and other chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy and translocations)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/leukemia-acute-lymphocytic-all/prognosis-and-survival/?region=on|title=Prognosis and survival for acute lymphocytic leukemia - Canadian Cance|website=www.cancer.ca|access-date=6 December 2017|archive-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207014817/http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/leukemia-acute-lymphocytic-all/prognosis-and-survival/?region=on|url-status=dead}}</ref>
