'''Ticks''' are parasitic [[arachnid]]s of the order '''Ixodida'''. They are part of the [[mite]] superorder [[Parasitiformes]]. Adult ticks are approximately 3 to 5&nbsp;mm in length depending on age, sex, species, and "fullness". Ticks are external [[parasite]]s, living by [[hematophagy|feeding on the blood]] of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The timing of the origin of ticks is uncertain, though the oldest known tick fossils are from the [[Cretaceous]] period, around 100 million years old. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.

Ticks belong to two major families, the [[Ixodidae]] or hard ticks, and the [[Argasidae]], or soft ticks. ''[[Nuttalliella]],'' a genus of tick from southern Africa, is the only member of the family Nuttalliellidae, and represents the most primitive living lineage of ticks. Adults have ovoid/pear-shaped bodies (idiosomas) which become engorged with blood when they feed, and eight legs. Their [[cephalothorax]] and abdomen are completely fused. In addition to having a hard shield on their dorsal surfaces, known as the scutum, hard ticks have a beak-like structure at the front containing the mouthparts, whereas soft ticks have their mouthparts on the underside of their bodies. Ticks locate potential hosts by sensing odor, body heat, moisture, and/or vibrations in the environment.<ref>{{cite web|last=<!--Not stated--> |date=21 September 2020|title=How ticks spread disease |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/life_cycle_and_hosts.html|access-date=29 November 2020|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref>

Ticks have four stages to their life cycle, namely egg, [[larva]], [[nymph (biology)|nymph]], and adult. Ticks belonging to the '''Ixodidae''' family undergo either a one-host, two-host, or three-host [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].<ref name="CDC - DPDx - Ticks">{{cite web|date=23 January 2019|title=Ticks|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/ticks/index.html|access-date=29 November 2020|website=CDC - DPDx|language=en-us}}</ref> Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages ([[instar]]s), each one requiring blood ingestion, and as such, Argasid ticks undergo a multihost life cycle. Because of their hematophagous (blood-ingesting) diets, ticks act as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of many serious diseases that affect humans and other animals.

Ticks belong to the [[Parasitiformes]], a distinctive group of mites that are separate from the main group of mites, the [[Acariformes]]. Whether the two groups are more closely related to each other than to other arachnids is uncertain, and studies often recover them as not closely related.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giribet|first=Gonzalo|date=March 2018|title=Current views on chelicerate phylogeny—A tribute to Peter Weygoldt|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0044523118300044|journal=Zoologischer Anzeiger|language=en|volume=273|pages=7–13|doi=10.1016/j.jcz.2018.01.004|s2cid=90344977 }}</ref> Within the Parasitiformes, ticks are most closely related to the [[Holothyrida]], a small group of free living scavengers with 32 described species confined to the landmasses that formed the supercontinent [[Gondwana]].<ref name=":0" />

Ticks, like [[mites]], belong to the subclass Acari that lack their primary somatic segmentation of the [[abdomen]] (or [[opisthosoma]]), rather these parasitic [[arachnid]]s present a subsequent fusion of the abdomen with the [[cephalothorax]] (or [[prosoma]]).<ref name=Ruppert/> The [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]] typical of other [[Chelicerata]] have developed into the [[gnathosoma]] (head), which is retractable and contains the mouthparts, and idiosoma (body), which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs.<ref name="Wall-55" /> The gnathosoma is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology | edition = 7th | vauthors = Ruppert EE, Fox RS, Barnes RD |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=590–595 }}</ref> Features of the gnathosoma include two [[palp]]s, two [[chelicera]]e, and [[hypostome]].

Ticks find their hosts by detecting an animals' breath and body odors, sensing body heat, moisture, or vibrations.<ref name=CVBDhost/> A common misconception about ticks is they jump onto their host or they fall from trees, however, they are incapable of flying or jumping, although [[static electricity]] from their hosts has been shown to be capable of pulling the tick over distances several times their own body length.<ref>[https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00772-8 Static electricity passively attracts ticks onto hosts]</ref> Many tick species, particularly Ixodidae, lie in wait in a position known as "questing". While questing, ticks cling to leaves and grasses by their third and fourth pairs of legs. They hold the first pair of legs outstretched, waiting to grasp and climb on to any passing host. Tick questing heights tend to be correlated with the size of the desired host; nymphs and small species tend to quest close to the ground, where they may encounter small mammalian or bird hosts; adults climb higher into the vegetation, where larger hosts may be encountered. Some species are hunters and lurk near places where hosts may rest. Upon receiving an [[olfactory]] stimulus or other environmental indication, they crawl or run across the intervening surface.<ref name=CVBDhost>{{cite web |url=http://www.cvbd.org/en/tick-borne-diseases/about-ticks/tick-feeding/host-seeking/ |title=Host seeking |work=CVBD: Companion Vector-Borne Diseases |access-date=8 December 2016}}</ref>

Other ticks, mainly the Argasidae, are [[nidicolous]], finding hosts in their nests, burrows, or caves. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to identify hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors.<ref name=CVBDhost/> Many of them feed primarily on [[bird]]s, though some ''Ornithodoros'' species, for example, feed on small [[mammal]]s. Both groups of soft tick feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand, in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings, where they come out nightly to attack roosting birds or emerge when they detect [[carbon dioxide]] in the breath of their hosts.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001">[[#Allan|Allan (2001)]]</ref>

Ixodidae remain in place until they are completely engorged. Their weight may increase by 200 to 600 times compared to their prefeeding weight. To accommodate this expansion, cell division takes place to facilitate enlargement of the cuticle.<ref name=CVBDhard>{{cite web |url=http://www.cvbd.org/en/tick-borne-diseases/about-ticks/general-morphology/hard-ticks/ |title=Hard ticks |work=CVBD: Companion Vector-Borne Diseases |access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref> In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested, but does not grow new cells, with the weight of the tick increasing five- to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal.<ref name=CVBDsoft />

Tick saliva contains about 1,500 to 3,000 proteins, depending on the tick species. The proteins with anti-inflammatory properties, called [[evasin]]s, allow ticks to feed for eight to ten days without being perceived by the host animal. Researchers are studying these evasins with the goal of developing drugs to neutralise the chemokines that cause [[myocarditis]], heart attack, and stroke.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-06-bug-drugtick-saliva-key-heart.html|title=From bug to drug—tick saliva could be key to treating heart disease|date=27 June 2017|publisher=Phys.org|author=University of Oxford}}</ref>

===Range and habitat===
Tick species are widely distributed around the world.<ref>[[#Magnarelli|Magnarelli (2009)]]</ref> They tend to flourish more in warm, humid climates, because they require a certain amount of moisture in the air to undergo [[metamorphosis]], and low temperatures inhibit their development of eggs to larvae.<ref name="London1905">[[#Nuttall|Nuttall (1905)]]</ref>

=== Ecology ===
In general, ticks are found wherever their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on through their migrations; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt discovered more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. It was also observed the tick species varied depending on the season of migration, in this study it is spring and autumn migrations, this is thought to occur due to the seasonal periodicities of the different species.<ref name="Hoogstraal">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoogstraal H, Kaiser MN, Traylor MA, Guindy E, Gaber S | title = Ticks (Ixodidae) on birds migrating from Europe and Asia to Africa 1959-61 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–62 | year = 1963 | pmid = 13961632 | pmc = 2554471 }}</ref>

For an ecosystem to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements; the population density of host species in the area must be great enough and it must be humid enough for ticks to remain hydrated.<ref name="Wall-55">[[#Wall|Wall & Shearer (2001)]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=AMljlwB0ej0C&pg=PA55 p. 55]</ref> Due to their role in transmitting [[Lyme disease]], Ixodid ticks, particularly the North American [[Ixodes scapularis|''I.&nbsp;scapularis'']], have been studied using [[geographic information system]]s to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence of deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001" />

Mites and nematodes feed on ticks, which are also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, ticks act as a disease vector and behave as the primary hosts of many different [[pathogen]]s such as [[spirochaete]]s. Ticks carry various debilitating diseases therefore, ticks may assist in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.<ref>{{cite news |title=The mighty tick | vauthors = Ray CC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/science/would-eradicating-deer-ticks-hurt-the-ecosystem.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |date=28 May 2012 |access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref>

===Life cycle===
All three tick families ticks have four life cycle stages: egg, [[larva]], [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]], and adult.<ref>[[#Dennis|Dennis & Piesman (2005)]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKlUARLKT9IC&pg=PA5 p. 5]{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

====Ixodidae====
{{main|Ixodidae}}
Ixodidae ticks have three different life cycles. Depending on the species, Ixodids can either possess a one-host life cycle, two-host life cycle, or three-host life cycle.

===== One-host ticks =====
In one-host ticks the tick remains on the host through the larval, nymphal, and adult stages, only to leave the host to lay eggs. Eggs laid in the environment hatch into larvae, which immediately seek out a host in which to attach and feed. Fed larvae molt into unfed nymphs that remain on the host. After engorging on the host's blood, the nymphs molt into sexually mature adults that remain on the host in order to feed and mate. Once a female is both fed and ready to lay eggs, only then does she leave the host in search of a suitable area to deposit her eggs. Ticks that follow this life cycle are called one-host ticks. The winter tick ''Dermacentor albipictus'' and the cattle tick ''Boophilus microplus'' are examples of one-host ticks.<ref name="Sonenshine_1991">{{cite book | vauthors = Sonenshine D | date = 1991| title = Biology of Ticks | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York }}</ref>

===== Two-host ticks =====
The life cycle of a two-host tick often spans two years.<ref name="CDC - DPDx - Ticks"/> During fall the pregnant female tick will drop off her second host and lay her eggs. The eggs hatch during winter, the following spring the larvae emerge and attach to their first host. Newly hatched larvae attach to a host in order to obtain a blood meal. They remain on the host then develop into nymphs. Once engorged, they drop off the host and find a safe area in the natural environment in which to molt into adults, this typically occurs during the winter. Both male and female adults seek out a host on which to attach, which may be the same body that served as host during their early development but is often a larger mammal. Once attached, they feed and mate. [[mwod:gravid|Gravid]] females drop from the host to [[Oviparity|oviposit]] in the environment. Ticks that complete their life cycle in this manner are called two-host ticks, like ''Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum.''<ref name="Sonenshine_1991" />

===== Three-host ticks =====
Most ixodid ticks require three hosts, and their life cycles typically span three years. The female tick drops off its host, often in the fall, and lays thousands of eggs.<ref name="CDC - DPDx - Ticks"/> The larvae hatch in the winter and emerge in the spring. When the larvae emerge, they attach and feed primarily on small mammals and birds. During the summer the larvae become engorged and drop off the first host to molt and become nymphs, this often occurs during the fall. The following spring the nymphs emerge and seek out another host, often a small rodent. The nymphs become engorged and drop off the host in the fall to molt and become adults. The following spring the adult ticks emerge and seek out a larger host, often a large mammal such as cattle or even humans.  Females will mate on their third host. Female adults then engorge on blood and prepare to drop off to lay her eggs on the ground, while males feed very little and remain on the host in order to continue mating with other females.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001" /><ref name="Sonenshine_1991" />

====Argasidae====
{{main|Argasidae}}

Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may go through up to seven nymphal stages (instars), requiring a meal of blood each time.<ref name="Aeschlimann-182">[[#Aeschlimann|Aeschlimann & Freyvogel, 1995]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=YwJF6qzhrbkC&pg=PA177 p. 182]</ref> Often, egg laying and mating occurs detached from the host in a safe environment.<ref name="CDC - DPDx - Ticks"/> The eggs hatch and the larvae feed on a nearby host for anywhere from a few hours to several days, this depends on the species of tick. After they feed the larvae drop and molt into their first nymphal instars, then the nymph seeks out and feeds on its second host, often this is the same as the first host, within an hour. This process occurs repeatedly and until the last nymphal instar occurs, thus allowing the tick to molt into an adult. Once an adult these ticks feed rapidly and periodically their entire life cycle. In some species an adult female may lay eggs after each feeding. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs over the course of her lifetime. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process that is unique to argasid ticks.<ref name="SamuelPybus2001"/>

====Nuttalliellidae====
{{Main|Nuttalliella}}

Nuttalliellidae is an elusive monotypic family of tick, that is, possesses a single species, ''Nuttalliella namaqua.'' There is little to nothing known about the life cycle and feeding habits of ''N. namaqua'' but it is speculated this species of tick has multiple different hosts''.''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mans BJ, de Klerk D, Pienaar R, Latif AA | title = Nuttalliella namaqua: a living fossil and closest relative to the ancestral tick lineage: implications for the evolution of blood-feeding in ticks | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = e23675 | date = 2011-08-17 | pmid = 21858204 | pmc = 3157464 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0023675 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...623675M | issn = 1932-6203 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Some species, notably the [[Ixodes holocyclus|Australian paralysis tick]], are also intrinsically [[venom]]ous and can cause [[tick paralysis]]. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's [[ovary|ovaries]], in which case the larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host.<ref name="Aeschlimann-182" /> [[Tropical bont tick]]s transmit the [[Ehrlichia ruminantium|heartwater]], which can be particularly devastating in cattle.<ref name=Texas/> The ticks carried by migratory birds act as reservoirs and vectors of foreign infectious diseases. In the Egyptian migratory bird study, over 20 strains of pathogenic viruses were detected within the tick sample from autumn.<ref name=Hoogstraal/>

Not all ticks in an infective area are infected with transmittable pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long feeding session are necessary for diseases to be transmitted.<ref name=CVBDtransmission/> Consequently, tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Feldman G, Feldman L, Macnair P |title=All about ticks: why it's so important to remove a tick |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/conditions/infections/a5559/tick-removal/|publisher=Netdoctor |access-date=8 December 2016 |date=6 March 2014}}</ref> Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, before then disinfecting the wound.<ref name=cdc>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html |title=Tick removal |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="Pace2020">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pace EJ, O'Reilly M |title=Tickborne diseases: diagnosis and management |journal=American Family Physician |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=530–540 |date=2020 |pmid=32352736 |doi= |url=https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0501/p530.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230717113305/https://www.aafp.org/dam/brand/aafp/pubs/afp/issues/2020/0501/p530.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2023}}</ref> In Australia and New Zealand, where tick-borne infections are less common than tick reactions, the [[Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy]] recommends seeking medical assistance or killing ticks [[In situ|in-situ]] by freezing and then leaving them to fall out to prevent allergic/anaphylactic reactions.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Animation - How to Safely Remove Ticks |url=https://www.allergy.org.au/about-ascia/info-updates/how-to-safely-remove-ticks-animation |website=www.allergy.org.au |publisher=Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327131921/https://www.allergy.org.au/about-ascia/info-updates/how-to-safely-remove-ticks-animation |archive-date=27 March 2023 |date=13 April 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ascia2019">{{cite web |title=Tick Allergy |url=https://www.allergy.org.au/images/pcc/ASCIA_PCC_Tick_Allergy_2019.pdf |website=Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy |access-date=17 July 2023 |date=21 May 2019}}</ref> Professor [[Sheryl van Nunen]], whose research in 2007 identified tick-induced mammalian meat allergy, famously said "[[Rhyme-as-reason effect|tweezers are tick squeezers]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiara.org.au/|title=TIARA - Tick Induced Allergies Research and Awareness|website=TIARA - Tick Induced Allergies Research and Awareness|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref><ref name="Salleh_2020">{{cite web | vauthors = Salleh A |date=2020-01-01|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-01-01/what-do-you-do-when-you-have-a-tick/11789538|title=Tweeze vs freeze: Here's the lowdown on how to get rid of a tick|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> referring to the tick toxins squeezed into people attempting to remove ticks with tweezers.

[[Bifenthrin]] and [[permethrin]], both [[pyrethroid]]s, are sometimes used as tick-control measures, although they have the disadvantage of being [[carcinogen]]ic and able to attack the nervous systems of other species besides ticks. Those who walk through tick-infested areas can make it harder for ticks to latch onto them by tucking their trousers into boots made of smooth rubber, which ticks have trouble climbing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/03/the-pesticides-bifenthrin-and-permethrin-may-get-rid-of-ticks-but-at-what-cost/| vauthors = Atwell T |date=3 January 2016|publisher=Press Herald|title=Pesticides may get rid of ticks, but at what cost?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syracuse.com/outdoors/2014/06/what_do_the_experts_do_to_keep_ticks_off_themselves.html|title=Outdoors experts: Keep ticks off by spraying repellent on your clothes| vauthors = Figura D |publisher=Syracuse.com|date=4 June 2014}}</ref>

Research since 2008 has documented red-meat allergies (mammalian meat allergy and [[Alpha-gal allergy]]) in the U.S. due to [[Amblyomma americanum|lone star tick]] bites.

Many tick-transmitted viruses, such as [[Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus]], [[Kyasanur Forest disease virus]], [[Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus]], and [[Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus]], are classified as dangerous enough to require [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|biosafety level 4]] precautions in laboratory environments. This includes five levels of containment, viz., storage vials within humidified [[desiccator]]s, within [[environmental chamber]]s, within a tick suite, within a BSL4 laboratory. Precautions such as [[glove box]]es, sticky pads, Vaseline barriers, safety suits, gloves, sticky tape, silicone [[vacuum grease]], sticky trap paste, and micro mesh are used to safely contain ticks and prevent them from escaping.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thangamani S, Bente D | title = Establishing protocols for tick containment at Biosafety Level 4 | journal = Pathogens and Disease | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 282–5 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24838773 | pmc = 4107070 | doi = 10.1111/2049-632X.12187 }}</ref>

===Population control measures===
[[File:Tick dragging.jpg|thumb|Researcher collecting ticks using the "[[tick dragging]]" method]]

With the possible exception of widespread [[DDT]] use in the [[Soviet Union]], attempts to limit the population or distribution of disease-causing ticks have been quite unsuccessful.<ref name="Dennis-3">[[#Dennis|Dennis & Piesman, 2005]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKlUARLKT9IC&pg=PA3 p. 3]{{Dead link|date=July 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 
The parasitoid [[Encyrtidae|encyrtid wasp]] ''[[Ixodiphagus hookeri]]'' has been investigated for its potential to control tick populations.

Predators and competitors of tick hosts can indirectly reduce the density of infected nymphs, thereby lowering tick-borne disease risk by lowering the density and/or tick burden of reservoir-competent hosts. A study in the Netherlands found that the number of larval ticks on bank voles and wood mice was lower at sites with significant red fox (''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'') and stone marten (''[[Martes foina]]'') activity.<ref name="Hofmeester et al">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmeester TR, Jansen PA, Wijnen HJ, Coipan EC, Fonville M, Prins HH, Sprong H, van Wieren SE | title = Cascading effects of predator activity on tick-borne disease risk | journal = Proceedings.

This supports the results of a study from the [[northeastern United States]], in which the incidence of Lyme borreliosis was negatively correlated with the density of red fox, possibly because foxes decrease the density of [[white-footed mice]] (''Peromyscus leucopus''), the most important reservoir-competent host for ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]''.<ref name="Hofmeester et al"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levi T, Kilpatrick AM, Mangel M, Wilmers CC | title = Deer, predators, and the emergence of Lyme disease | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 27 | pages = 10942–7 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22711825 | pmc = 3390851 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1204536109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10910942L | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Another natural form of control for ticks is the [[helmeted guineafowl]], a bird species that consumes mass quantities of ticks.<ref>[[#Duffy|Duffy ''et al.''

Topical tick medicines may be toxic to animals and humans. The [[synthetic pyrethroid]] insecticide [[phenothrin]] in combination with the hormone analogue [[methoprene]] was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. Some products were withdrawn,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/flea-tick-drops.htm |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] |title=Hartz flea and tick drops for cats and kittens to be phased out |year=2005 |archive-date=11 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070012/http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/flea-tick-drops.htm}}</ref> and others are known to cause adverse reactions.
