The '''femur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|m|ər}}; {{plural form}}: '''femurs''' or '''femora''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|m|ər|ə}}),{{refn|{{cite Merriam-Webster|femora}}}}{{refn|
{{cite Dictionary.com|femora}}}} or '''thigh bone''' is the only [[long bone|bone]] in the [[thigh]]. The thigh is the region of the lower limb between the [[hip]] and the [[knee]]. In many [[quadrupeds|four-legged animals]] the femur is the upper bone of the [[hindleg]].

The [[Femoral head|top of the femur]] fits into a socket in the pelvis called the hip joint, and the bottom of the femur connects to the shinbone ([[tibia]]) and kneecap ([[patella]]) to form the knee. In humans the femur is the  largest and thickest bone in the body.

==Structure==
The femur is the only bone in the upper [[Human leg|leg]]. The two femurs converge [[Anatomical terms of location|medially]] toward the [[knee]]s, where they articulate with the [[Anatomical terms of location|proximal]] ends of the [[tibia]]e. The angle of convergence of the femora is a major factor in determining the [[femoral-tibial angle]]. Human females have thicker [[pelvic bone]]s, causing their femora to converge more than in males.

In the condition [[genu valgum|''genu valgum'' (knock knee)]] the femurs converge so much that the knees touch one another. The opposite extreme is [[Genu varum|''genu varum'' (bow-leggedness)]]. In the general population of people without either ''genu valgum'' or ''genu varum'',  the femoral-tibial angle is about 175 degrees.<ref name=Bojsen>{{cite book |last1=Bojsen-Møller |first1=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=da |trans-title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=239–241}}</ref>

The femur is the largest and thickest bone in the human body. By some tested measures,{{which|date=January 2024}} it is also the strongest bone in the human body, whereas other strength tests show the [[temporal bone]] to be the strongest bone. The femur length on average is 26.74% of a person's height,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Feldesman, M.R., J.G. Kleckner, and J.K. Lundy.|title=The femur/stature ratio and estimates of stature in mid-and late-Pleistocene fossil hominids.|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=November 1990|volume=83|issue=3|pages=359–372|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330830309|pmid=2252082}}</ref> a ratio found in both men and women and most [[ethnic group]]s with only restricted variation, and is useful in [[anthropology]] because it offers a basis for a reasonable estimate of a subject's height from an incomplete [[human skeleton|skeleton]].

The femur is categorised as a [[long bone]] and comprises a [[diaphysis]] (shaft or [[body of femur|body]]) and two [[Epiphysis|epiphyses]] (extremities) that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Upper part===
{{Main|Upper extremity of femur}}
[[File:Gray243.png|thumb|275px|The [[Upper extremity of femur|upper extremity]] of right femur viewed from behind and above, showing [[Femur head|head]], [[neck of femur|neck]], and the [[greater trochanter|greater]] and [[lesser trochanter]]]]
The [[Upper extremity of femur|upper]] or proximal extremity (close to the [[torso]]) contains the [[Femur head|head]], [[neck of femur|neck]], the two [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s and adjacent structures.<ref name=Bojsen/> The upper extremity is the shortest femoral extremity, the lower extremity is the thickest femoral extremity.

The [[femur head|head of the femur]], which [[joint (anatomy)|articulates]] with the [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvic bone]], comprises two-thirds of a [[sphere]]. It has a small groove, or [[Fovea of head of femur|fovea]], connected through the [[Ligament of head of femur|round ligament]] to the sides of the [[acetabular notch]]. The head of the femur is connected to the [[shaft of femur|shaft]] through the [[neck of femur|neck]] or ''collum''. The neck is 4–5&nbsp;cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed at its middle. The collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees. This angle is highly variant. In the [[infant]] it is about 150 degrees and in [[old age]] reduced to 120 degrees on average. An abnormal increase in the angle is known as [[coxa valga]] and an abnormal reduction is called [[coxa vara]]. Both the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the [[Muscles of the hip|hip musculature]] and can not be directly [[Palpation|palpated]]. In skinny people with the [[thigh]] laterally rotated, the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance [[profound]] (deep) for the [[femoral artery]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

The transition area between the head and neck is quite rough due to attachment of muscles and the [[capsule of hip joint|hip joint capsule]]. Here the two [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s, [[greater trochanter|greater]] and [[lesser trochanter]], are found. The greater trochanter is almost box-shaped and is the most [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] prominent of the femur. The highest point of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint of the [[hip joint]]. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. The [[trochanteric fossa]] is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest on the medial surface of the greater trochanter.
The lesser trochanter is a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. The two trochanters are joined by the [[intertrochanteric crest]] on the back side and by the [[intertrochanteric line]] on the front.<ref name=Bojsen/>

A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5&nbsp;cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the [[linea quadrata]] (or quadrate line).

About the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the intertrochanteric crest is the [[quadrate tubercle]] located. The size of the tubercle varies and it is not always located on the intertrochanteric crest and that also adjacent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercle, such as the posterior surface of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. In a small anatomical study it was shown that the [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal line]] passes directly through the quadrate tubercle.<ref name="pmid17104699">{{cite journal |author=Sunderland S |title=The Quadrate Tubercle of the Femur |journal=J. Anat. |volume=72 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=309–12 |date=January 1938 |pmid=17104699 |pmc=1252427 }}</ref>

===Body===
{{Main|Body of femur}}
[[File:Long Bone (Femur).png|thumb|The femur details]]
The [[body of femur|body of the femur (or shaft)]] is large, thick and almost cylindrical in form. It is a little broader above than in the center, broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below. It is slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the [[linea aspera]] which diverges proximally and distal as the medial and lateral ridge. Proximally the lateral ridge of the linea aspera becomes the [[gluteal tuberosity]] while the medial ridge continues as the [[Pectineal line (femur)|pectineal line]]. Besides the linea aspera the shaft has two other bordes; a [[body of femur#Lateral border and medial border|lateral and medial border]]. These three bordes separates the shaft into three surfaces: One [[body of femur#Anterior surface|anterior]], one medial and one lateral. Due to the vast [[Thigh#Muscles and fascia|musculature of the thigh]] the shaft can not be [[Palpation|palpated]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

The [[third trochanter]] is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. When present, it is oblong, rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge.<ref name="Lozanoff-1985">{{cite journal

===Lower part===
{{Main|Lower extremity of femur}}
[[File:Gray246.png|thumbnail|right|Lower extremity of right femur viewed from below.]]
[[File:Gray348.png|thumbnail|right|Left [[knee joint]] from behind, showing interior ligaments.]]
The [[lower extremity of femur|lower extremity of the femur]] (or distal extremity) is the thickest femoral extremity, the [[upper extremity of femur|upper extremity]] is the shortest femoral extremity. It is somewhat cuboid in form, but its transverse diameter is greater than its antero-posterior (front to back). It consists of two oblong eminences known as the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyles]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

Anteriorly, the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated by a smooth shallow articular depression called the patellar surface. Posteriorly, they project considerably and a deep notch, the [[Intercondylar fossa of femur]], is present between them. The [[lateral condyle of femur|lateral condyle]] is the more prominent and is the broader both in its antero-posterior and transverse diameters. The [[medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle]] is the longer and, when the femur is held with its body perpendicular, projects to a lower level. When, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. The condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and medialward. Their opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form the walls of the [[Anterior intercondyloid fossa|intercondyloid fossa]]. This fossa is limited above by a ridge, the [[intercondyloid line of femur|intercondyloid line]], and below by the central part of the posterior margin of the patellar surface. The [[posterior cruciate ligament]] of the [[knee]] joint is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the [[anterior cruciate ligament]] to an impression on the upper and back part of its lateral wall.<ref name=Bojsen/>

The articular surface of the lower end of the femur occupies the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. Its front part is named the patellar surface and articulates with the [[patella]]; it presents a median groove which extends downward to the [[intercondylar fossa of femur|intercondyloid fossa]] and two convexities, the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than the medial.<ref name=Bojsen/>

Each condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the [[epicondyle]]. The [[medial epicondyle of the femur|medial epicondyle]] is a large convex eminence to which the [[tibial collateral ligament]] of the knee-joint is attached. At its upper part is the [[adductor tubercle]] and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the [[gastrocnemius]]. The [[lateral epicondyle of the femur|lateral epicondyle]] which is smaller and less prominent than the medial, gives attachment to the [[fibular collateral ligament]] of the [[knee-joint]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Development===
{{main|Limb development}}
The femur develops from the [[limb bud]]s as a result of interactions between the [[ectoderm]] and the underlying [[mesoderm]]; formation occurs roughly around the fourth week of development.<ref name ="Gilbert, Scott F.">[http://9e.devbio.com/  Gilbert, Scott F. "Developmental Biology". 9th ed., 2010]</ref>

By the sixth week of development, the first [[hyaline cartilage]] model of the femur is formed by [[chondrocytes]]. [[Endochondral ossification]] begins by the end of the [[embryonic period]] and primary [[ossification center]]s are present in all long bones of the limbs, including the femur, by the 12th week of development. The [[hindlimb]] development lags behind [[forelimb]] development by 1–2 days.

==Function==
As the femur is the only bone in the thigh, it serves as an attachment point for all the muscles that exert their force over the hip and knee joints. Some [[biarticular muscle]]s – which cross two joints, like the [[gastrocnemius]] and [[plantaris]] muscles – also originate from the femur. In all, 23 individual muscles either originate from or insert onto the femur.

In cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate [[Fascial compartments of thigh|fascial compartments]] divided by [[fascia]], each containing muscles. These compartments use the femur as an axis, and are separated by tough [[connective tissue]] membranes (or [[septum|septa]]). Each of these compartments has its own [[blood]] and [[nerve]] supply, and contains a different group of [[muscle]]s. These compartments are named the [[Anterior compartment of thigh|anterior]], [[Medial fascial compartment of thigh|medial]] and [[Posterior fascial compartment of thigh|posterior fascial compartments]].

==Clinical significance==

===Fractures===
{{Main|Hip fracture|femoral fracture}}
A [[femoral fracture]] that involves the [[femoral head]], [[femoral neck]] or the [[shaft of the femur]] immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a [[hip fracture]], especially when associated with [[osteoporosis]].  Femur fractures can be managed in a pre-hospital setting with the use of a [[traction splint]].

In primitive tetrapods, the main points of muscle attachment along the femur are the '''internal trochanter''' and [[third trochanter]], and a ridge along the ventral surface of the femoral shaft referred to as the '''adductor crest'''. The neck of the femur is generally minimal or absent in the most primitive forms, reflecting a simple attachment to the acetabulum. The greater trochanter was present in the extinct [[archosaur]]s, as well as in modern birds and mammals, being associated with the loss of the primitive sprawling gait. The lesser trochanter is a unique development of mammals, which lack both the internal and fourth trochanters. The adductor crest is also often absent in mammals or alternatively reduced to a series of creases along the surface of the bone.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 204–205|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref> Structures analogous to the [[third trochanter]] are present in mammals, including some primates.<ref name="Bolanowski-2005"/>

In some snakes the protruding end of a [[pelvic spur]], a vestigial pelvis and femur remnant which is not connected to the rest of the skeleton, plays a role in mating. This role in mating is hypothesized to have possibly occurred in ''[[Basilosauridae]]'', an extinct family of whales with well-defined femurs, lower legs and feet. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature legs ([[atavism]]).<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Lars|last1=Bejder|first2=Brian K.|last2=Hall|year=2002|title=Limbs in whales and limblessness in other vertebrates: mechanisms of evolutionary and developmental transformation and loss|journal=Evolution & Development|volume=4|issue=6|pages=445–458|doi=10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02033.x|pmid=12492145|s2cid=8448387}}</ref>

One of the earliest known vertebrates to have a femur is the ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'', a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] from the [[Late Devonian]] period.

===Invertebrates===
{{Main|Arthropod leg}}
In [[invertebrate zoology]] the name ''femur'' appears in [[arthropod]]ology. The usage is not homologous with that of vertebrate anatomy; the term "femur" simply has been adopted by analogy and refers, where applicable, to the most proximal of (usually) the two longest jointed segments of the legs of the [[arthropoda]]. The two basal segments preceding the femur are the [[Arthropod leg|coxa]] and [[Arthropod leg|trochanter]]. This convention is not followed in [[Crustacean|carcinology]] but it applies in [[arachnology]] and [[entomology]]. In [[Myriapoda|myriapodology]] another segment, the [[prefemur]], connects the trochanter and femur.
