A '''papilloma''' (plural '''papillomas''' or '''papillomata''') (''[[wikt:papillo-|papillo-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-oma|-oma]]'') is a [[Benign tumor|benign]] [[epithelial]] [[tumor]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000077986|papilloma}}</ref> growing exophytically (outwardly projecting) in [[nipple]]-like and often [[finger]]-like [[fronds]]. In this context, [[wiktionary:papilla|papilla]] refers to the projection created by the tumor, not a tumor on an already existing papilla (such as the nipple).

When used without context, it frequently refers to infections ([[squamous cell papilloma]]) caused by [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), such as [[wart]]s. Human papillomavirus infection is a major cause of [[cervical cancer]], [[vulvar cancer]], [[vaginal cancer]], [[penis cancer]], [[anal cancer]], and [[HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer|HPV-positive]] [[oropharyngeal cancer]]s.<ref name="NEJM2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Muñoz N, Bosch FX, de Sanjosé S, Herrero R, Castellsagué X, Shah KV, Snijders PJ, Meijer CJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Epidemiologic classification of human papillomavirus types associated with cervical cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 348 | issue = 6 | pages = 518–527 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12571259 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa021641 | hdl-access = free | df = dmy-all | s2cid = 1451343 | collaboration = International Agency for Research on Cancer Multicenter Cervical Cancer Study Group | hdl = 2445/122831 }}</ref><ref name="Parkin 2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkin DM | title = The global health burden of infection-associated cancers in the year 2002 | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 118 | issue = 12 | pages = 3030–3044 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16404738 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.21731 | s2cid = 10042384 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Lj2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ljubojevic S, Skerlev M | title = HPV-associated diseases | journal = Clinics in Dermatology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–234 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24559558 | doi = 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2013.08.007 | s2cid = 24219797 }}</ref><ref name=WHO2016>{{cite web|title=Human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/|website=WHO |date=June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805111143/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/|archive-date=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="StatPearls 2020">{{cite book | vauthors = Anjum F, Zohaib J |title=Definitions |chapter=Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma |date=4 December 2020 |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563268/ |work=StatPearls |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |edition=Updated |id=Bookshelf ID: NBK563268 |doi=10.32388/G6TG1L |pmid=33085415 |s2cid=229252540 |via=[[NCBI]] |access-date=7 February 2021}}</ref> Most [[Wart|viral warts]] are caused by human papillomavirus infection (HPV),<ref name="IQ2014">{{cite journal |date=7 November 2019 |orig-year=30 July 2014 |title=Warts: Overview|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072770/ |url-status=live |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]] |edition=Updated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910145251/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072770/ |archive-date=10 September 2017 |access-date=7 February 2021}}</ref> of which there are nearly 200 distinct human papillomaviruses (HPVs),<ref name=Lj2014/> and many HPV types are [[Carcinogenic virus|carcinogenic]].<ref name="NEJM2003"/><ref name="Parkin 2006"/> There are, however, a number of other conditions that cause papilloma, as well as many cases in which there is no known cause.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical
 |image1=Pedunculated and Sessile Labelled.jpg |caption1=[[HPV]]6 pedunculated papilloma behind the uvula and HPV6 sessile papilloma next to the uvula |width1=
 |image2=Pedunculated.jpg |caption2=HPV6 pedunculated papilloma removed from behind the uvula using a laser |width2=}}
A benign papillomatous tumor is derived from epithelium, with [[cauliflower]]-like projections that arise from the [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] surface.
It may appear white or normal colored. It may be [[pedunculated]] or [[Sessility (medicine)|sessile]]. The average size is between 1–5&nbsp;cm. Neither sex is significantly more likely to develop them. The most common site is the [[palate]]-[[uvula]] area followed by tongue and lips. Durations range from weeks to 10 years.

==Presence of HPV==
[[Immunoperoxidase]] stains have identified antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 in approximately 50% of cases of [[squamous cell papilloma]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quinlan |first=Jeffrey D. |date=August 2021 |title=Human Papillomavirus: Screening, Testing, and Prevention |url=https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0800/p152.html |journal=American Family Physician |language=en-US |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=152–159 |issn=1532-0650}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
There is no evidence that papillomas are [[premalignant]].

==Differential diagnosis==
* Intraoral [[verruca vulgaris]], 
* [[Condyloma acuminatum]], and 
* [[Focal epithelial hyperplasia]].

Note: differentiation is done accurately by [[Histopathology|microscopic examination]] only.

==Treatment==
With conservative surgical excision, recurrence is rare.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}
