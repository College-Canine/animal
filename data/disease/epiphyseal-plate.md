The '''epiphyseal plate''', '''epiphysial plate''', '''physis''', or '''growth plate''' is a [[hyaline cartilage]] plate in the [[metaphysis]] at each end of a [[long bone]]. It is the part of a long bone where new bone growth takes place; that is, the whole bone is alive, with maintenance [[bone remodeling|remodeling]] throughout its existing [[bone tissue]], but the growth plate is the place where the long bone grows longer (adds length).

The plate is only found in children and adolescents;  in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an [[epiphyseal line]]. This replacement is known as '''epiphyseal closure''' or '''growth plate fusion'''. Complete fusion can occur as early as 12 for girls (with the most common being 14–15 years for girls) and as early as 14 for boys (with the most common being 15–17 years for boys).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16225203 |title=Age ranges of epiphyseal fusion in the distal tibia and fibula of contemporary males and females |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1001–7 |date=September 2005 |quote=complete fusion in females occurs as early as 12 years in the distal tibia and fibula.

==Structure==
===Development===
[[Endochondral ossification]] is responsible for the initial bone development from cartilage [[Uterus|in utero]] and infants and the longitudinal growth of long bones in the epiphyseal plate. The plate's [[chondrocytes]] are under constant division by [[mitosis]]. These [[daughter cell]]s stack facing the [[epiphysis]] while the older cells are pushed towards the [[diaphysis]]. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, [[osteoblasts]] ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty increasing levels of estrogen, in both females and males, leads to increased [[apoptosis]] of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate.<ref name="pmid21068162">{{cite journal|last=Zhong|first=M|author2=Carney, DH |author3=Boyan, BD |author4= Schwartz, Z |title=17β-Estradiol regulates rat growth plate chondrocyte apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway not involving nitric oxide or MAPKs.|journal=Endocrinology|date=January 2011|volume=152|issue=1|pages=82–92|pmid=21068162|doi=10.1210/en.2010-0509|doi-access=free}}</ref> Depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less [[ossification]] and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage have become replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar which later disappears.<ref name="seerbonedev">{{cite web|url=http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit3_3_bone_growth.html |title=Skeletal System / Bone Development and Growth |access-date=2008-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709164649/http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit3_3_bone_growth.html |archive-date=2008-07-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Histology===
The growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement as follows:<ref>{{cite book|last=Ovalle|first=William K.|title=Netter's essential histology : with Student consult online access|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9781929007868|edition=1st|author2=Nahirney, Patrick C.}}</ref>

! Epiphyseal plate zone (from epiphysis to diaphysis) !! Description
|-
| Zone of reserve || Quiescent chondrocytes are found at the epiphyseal end
|-
| Zone of proliferation || Chondrocytes undergo rapid mitosis under influence of [[growth hormone]]
|-
| Zone of maturation and hypertrophy || Chondrocytes stop mitosis, and begin to [[hypertrophy]] by accumulating glycogen, lipids, and [[alkaline phosphatase]]
|-
| Zone of calcification || Chondrocytes undergo [[apoptosis]]. Cartilagenous matrix begins to calcify.
|-
| Zone of ossification || Osteoclasts and osteoblasts from the diaphyseal side break down the calcified cartilage and replace with mineralized bone tissue.

==Clinical significance==
Defects in the development and continued division of epiphyseal plates can lead to growth disorders collectively known as [[osteochondrodysplasia]]. The most common defect is [[achondroplasia]], where there is a defect in cartilage formation. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of [[dwarfism]] or [[short stature]] and it also manifests in generalized deformities of bones and joints. However, various other types of osteochondrodysplasias can cause short stature and generalized deformities of bones and joints due to abnormal function of growth plate cartilage cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=El-Sobky |first1=TamerA |last2=Shawky |first2=RabahM |last3=Sakr |first3=HossamM |last4=Elsayed |first4=SolafM |last5=Elsayed |first5=NermineS |last6=Ragheb |first6=ShaimaaG |last7=Gamal |first7=Radwa |title=A systematized approach to radiographic assessment of commonly seen genetic bone diseases in children: A pictorial review |journal=Journal of Musculoskeletal Surgery and Research |date=2017 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=25 |doi=10.4103/jmsr.jmsr_28_17|s2cid=79825711 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Hereditary multiple exostoses]] is a genetic condition that is caused by growth irregularities of the epiphyseal plates of the long bones of the upper<ref>{{cite journal |last1=E.L.-Sobky |first1=Tamer A. |last2=Samir |first2=Shady |last3=Atiyya |first3=Ahmed Naeem |last4=Mahmoud |first4=Shady |last5=Aly |first5=Ahmad S. |last6=Soliman |first6=Ramy |title=Current paediatric orthopaedic practice in hereditary multiple osteochondromas of the forearm: a systematic review |journal=SICOT-J |date=2018 |volume=4 |pages=10 |doi=10.1051/sicotj/2018002 |pmid=29565244 |pmc= 5863686}}</ref> and lower limbs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duque Orozco |first1=Maria del Pilar |last2=Abousamra |first2=Oussama |last3=Rogers |first3=Kenneth J. |last4=Thacker |first4=Mihir M. |title=Radiographic Analysis of the Pediatric Hip Patients With Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics |date=July 2018 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=305–311 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0000000000000815 |pmid=27328120|s2cid=23800752 }}</ref> It usually results in limb deformities and a certain degree of functional limitations.

[[Salter–Harris fracture]]s are fractures involving epiphyseal plates and hence tend to interfere with growth, height or physiologic functions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mirghasemi|first1=Alireza|last2=Mohamadi|first2=Amin|last3=Ara|first3=Ali Majles|last4=Gabaran|first4=Narges Rahimi|last5=Sadat|first5=Mir Mostafa|date=November 2009|title=Completely displaced S-1/S-2 growth plate fracture in an adolescent: case report and review of literature|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma|volume=23|issue=10|pages=734–738|doi=10.1097/BOT.0b013e3181a23d8b|issn=1531-2291|pmid=19858983|s2cid=6651435}}</ref>

[[Osgood–Schlatter disease]] results from stress on the epiphyseal plate in the [[tibia]], leading to excess bone growth and a painful lump at the knee.

There are important clinical implications of the growth plate physiology. For example guided growth surgery, also known as temporary hemi[[epiphysiodesis]] is used to achieve correction or straightening of the bone deformities in a variety of pediatric orthopedic disorders such as [[Blount's disease]], [[rickets]], [[arthrogryposis]] multiplex congenita and [[osteochondrodysplasias]] among others.<ref name=Orthop2019>{{cite journal|last1= Journeau|first1=P| title= Update on guided growth concepts around the knee in children.|journal= Orthop Traumatol Surg Res|volume=S1877-0568|issue=19|pages=S171–S180|doi=10.1016/j.otsr.2019.04.025|pmid=31669550|year=2020|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=JAAOSGlobal>{{cite journal|last1= EL-Sobky|first1=TA|last2=Samir|first2=S|last3=Baraka|first3=MM|last4=Fayyad|first4=TA|last5=Mahran|first5=MA|last6=Aly|first6=AS|last7= Amen|first7=J|last8= Mahmoud|first8=S| title= Growth modulation for knee coronal plane deformities in children with nutritional rickets: A prospective series with treatment algorithm.|journal= JAAOS: Global Research and Reviews|date=1 January 2020|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e19.00009|doi=10.5435/JAAOSGlobal-D-19-00009|pmid=32159063|pmc=7028784|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=PediatricTrauma2019>{{cite journal|last1= Trofimova|first1= SI|last2= Buklaev|first2=DS|last3=Petrova|first3=EV|last4= Mulevanova|first4=SA| title= Guided growth for correction of knee flexion contracture in patients with arthrogryposis: preliminary results.|journal= Pediatric Traumatology, Orthopaedics and Reconstructive Surgery|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages= 64–70|doi=10.17816/PTORS4464-70|doi-access=free}}</ref> This applies to bone and joint deformities in the [[Coronal plane|coronal]] – medial/lateral – plane or [[genu varum]]/[[genu valgum]] plane<ref name=JAAOSGlobal /> and in the [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] – anterior/posterior – plane or knee flexion deformity/[[genu recurvatum]] plane.<ref name=PediatricTrauma2019 />

[[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] studied growing chickens. He observed bones grew at the ends and thus demonstrated the existence of the epiphyseal plates. Hunter is considered the "father of the growth plate".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic627.htm|title= Growth Plate (Physeal) Fractures
