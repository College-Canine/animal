'''Hypoalbuminemia''' (or '''hypoalbuminaemia''') is a [[medical sign]] in which the [[concentration|level]] of [[human serum albumin|albumin]] in the [[blood]] is low.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Douglas M.|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary|date=2000|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia [u.a.]|isbn=0721682618|page=[https://archive.org/details/trent_0116404640520/page/860 860]|edition=29.|url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116404640520/page/860}}</ref> This can be due to decreased production in the [[liver]], increased loss in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] or [[kidney]]s, increased use in the body, or abnormal distribution between body compartments. Patients often present with hypoalbuminemia as a result of another disease process such as malnutrition as a result of severe anorexia nervosa, [[sepsis]], [[cirrhosis]] in the [[liver]], [[nephrotic syndrome]] in the [[kidney]]s, or [[Protein losing enteropathy|protein-losing enteropathy]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. One of the roles of albumin is being the major driver of [[oncotic pressure]] (protein concentration within the blood) in the bloodstream and the body. Thus, hypoalbuminemia leads to abnormal distributions of fluids within the body and its compartments. As a result, associated symptoms include [[edema]] in the lower legs, [[ascites]] in the abdomen, and [[Effusion (disambiguation)|effusions]] around [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]]. Laboratory tests aimed at assessing liver function diagnose hypoalbuminemia. Once identified, it is a poor prognostic indicator for patients with a variety of different diseases. Yet, it is only treated in very specific indications in patients with [[cirrhosis]] and [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Treatment instead focuses on the underlying cause of the hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is an acute negative phase respondent and not a reliable indicator of nutrition status.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Pitting edema of the lower extremities commonly seen in conditions associated hypoalbuminemia.]]
Patients with hypoalbuminemia are more likely to present with it as a sign of an underlying disease process than as a primary disease process. By itself, hypoalbuminemia decreases the total [[protein]] concentration in [[blood plasma]], also known as the [[colloid osmotic pressure]], which causes fluid to exit the [[blood vessel]]s into tissues to equalize the concentrations. This leads to fluid-induced swelling of the extremities known as [[edema]], build-up of fluid in the abdomen known as [[ascites]], and fluid surrounding [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]] known as [[Effusion (disambiguation)|effusions]]. Patients also present with nonspecific findings such as [[fatigue]] and excessive [[weakness]]. Muehrcke's lines are a strong indicator of hypoalbuminemia.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.05.039| pmid = 28595765| issn = 0022-3476| volume = 189| pages = 234| last1 = Williams| first1 = Vijai| last2 = Jayashree| first2 = Muralidharan| title = Muehrcke Lines in an Infant| journal = The Journal of Pediatrics| date = October 2017| doi-access = free}}</ref> Hypoalbuminemia by itself may present without any symptoms, as the congenital and complete loss of albumin seen in [[Analbuminaemia|analbuminemia]] can be [[asymptomatic]]. Alternatively, it can present with death [[Uterus|in utero]] prior to birth or as a disease of adults characterized by edema, fatigue, and [[hyperlipidemia]]. The reason for this [[heterogeneity]] of presentation is not well understood.<ref name=":0" />

=== Complications ===
By itself, hypoalbuminemia can cause [[hypovolemia]] and [[circulatory collapse]] secondary to decreased [[oncotic pressure]] within the [[Circulatory system|vascular system]].<ref name=":0" /> Due to its metal-binding properties, hypoalbuminemia may lead to nutritional deficits including [[zinc deficiency]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Himoto|first1=Takashi|last2=Masaki|first2=Tsutomu|date=2018-01-14|title=Associations between Zinc Deficiency and Metabolic Abnormalities in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease|journal=Nutrients|volume=10|issue=1|pages=88|doi=10.3390/nu10010088|issn=2072-6643|pmc=5793316|pmid=29342898|doi-access=free }}</ref> Hypoalbuminemia associated with the nephrotic syndrome can lead to the development of [[hyperlipidemia]], although this is usually in the absence of [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name=":0" /> Further, in patients on [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]], hypoalbuminemia is associated with more advanced [[fluid overload]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dekker|first1=Marijke J. E.|last2=van der Sande|first2=Frank M.|last3=van den Berghe|first3=Florence|last4=Leunissen|first4=Karel M.

== Causes ==
Hypoalbuminemia can be caused through a number of different mechanisms, each with the result of decreasing albumin levels. These include: 1) impaired synthesis within the liver, 2) increased utilization by tissue, 3) distributional issues, and 4) increased excretion or loss.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Gatta|first1=Angelo|last2=Verardo|first2=Alberto|last3=Bolognesi|first3=Massimo|date=2012|title=Hypoalbuminemia|journal=Internal and Emergency Medicine|volume=7|issue=Suppl 3 |pages=S193–199|doi=10.1007/s11739-012-0802-0|issn=1970-9366|pmid=23073857|hdl=11577/2572741 |s2cid=262218475 }}</ref> Often, the cause is multifactorial as in liver cirrhosis, where reduced hepatic synthesis and increased capillary leakage combine to further decrease albumin levels.  {{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== Inflammation and infection ===
Albumin is considered a negative [[Acute-phase protein|acute phase reactant]], which means that as [[inflammation]] and other acute physiologic processes occur, its levels decrease. This is in contrast to acute phase reactants like [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP), whose levels increase with inflammatory processes. With respect to mechanism, [[inflammation]] leads to decreased production of albumin as a result of increased levels of [[cytokine]]s, specifically [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], and [[TNFα|TNF-α]].<ref name=":1" /> In patients with the overwhelming infections common in [[sepsis]] and [[septic shock]], hypoalbuminemia occurs as a result of the combinatorial effects of decreased synthesis as above, increased utilization by tissues, and increased transcapillary leakage from blood vessels due to increased [[vascular permeability]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Liver disease ===
[[File:Liver Cirrhosis.png|thumb|Healthy and cirrhotic liver. If present, hypoalbuminemia suggests advanced liver disease as seen in cirrhosis.]]
Albumin is synthesized in the [[liver]], and low serum albumin can be indicative of [[liver failure]] or diseases such as [[cirrhosis]] and chronic [[hepatitis]]. If present, hypoalbuminemia is generally considered to be a sign of advanced hepatic cirrhosis, or irreversible damage to the liver.<ref name=":0" /> Production of albumin can be one 60–80% lower in advanced cirrhosis than in healthy liver, an effect amplified by dilution ([[Salt retention|salt]] and [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]]), fluid shifts (following the accumulation of albumin in [[extracellular space]] and [[ascitic fluid]]), and even post-transcriptional changes to albumin itself.<ref name=":3" />

=== Kidney disease ===
[[File:Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis - high mag.jpg|thumb|Kidney biopsy showing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, one of the causes of nephrotic syndrome commonly seen in children.]]Hypoalbuminemia can also present as part of the [[nephrotic syndrome]], in which significant quantities of protein are lost in the [[urine]] due to [[kidney]] damage. Under normal conditions, less than 30 milligrams per day of albumin are lost via the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]].<ref name=":0" /> In nephrotic syndrome, protein loss can be as great as 3.5 grams over 24 hours, much of which is albumin, itself leading to hypoalbuminemia.<ref name=":0" /> In children, nephrotic syndrome is commonly a primary disease process that is largely [[Idiopathic disease|idiopathic]], although more genetic causes are being identified with the cost and accessibility of [[whole exome sequencing]]. After [[renal biopsy]], these syndromes are commonly diagnosed as [[minimal change disease]], [[membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]], or [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Cil|first1=Onur|last2=Perwad|first2=Farzana|date=2018|title=Monogenic Causes of Proteinuria in Children|journal=[[Frontiers in Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=55|doi=10.3389/fmed.2018.00055|issn=2296-858X|pmc=5858124|pmid=29594119|doi-access=free }}</ref> In adults, on the other hand, nephrotic syndrome is commonly a secondary disease process due to a variety of inciting factors. These inciting factors can be diverse, including [[toxin]]s, [[drug]]s, [[heavy metals]], [[Autoantibody|autoantibodies]], post-infectious [[Antibody|antibody complexes]], or [[immune complex]]es formed after [[malignancies]] like [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name=":0" />

[[Albuminuria]] and resultant hypoalbuminemia can also occur in [[chronic kidney disease]] without protein loss levels as high as seen in nephrotic syndrome. Here, albumin loss from the kidneys occur due to decreased [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) and subsequent loss of 30 to 300 milligrams of albumin per day. Over the course of months, this can lead to hypoalbuminemia, a common feature of [[end-stage renal disease]].<ref name=":0" /> Alterations in fluid distribution and the presence of ongoing inflammation in chronic kidney disease in combination with hypoalbuminemia make fluid status control especially difficult.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Kooman|first1=Jeroen P.|last2=van der Sande|first2=Frank M.|date=2019|title=Body Fluids in End-Stage Renal Disease: Statics and Dynamics|journal=Blood Purification|volume=47|issue=1–3|pages=223–229|doi=10.1159/000494583|issn=1421-9735|pmc=6492508|pmid=30517920}}</ref>

=== Malnutrition or malabsorption ===
[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|A girl with the physical signs and symptoms of Kwashiorkor, which is an extreme form of malnutrition-associated hypoalbuminemia.]]
[[Kwashiorkor]] is a disease of [[malnutrition]] characterized by decreased protein intake and [[amino acid]] deficiency resulting in hypoalbuminemia and a characteristic physical presentation. This is an extreme example of how malnutrition can result in hypoalbuminemia.<ref name=":0" /> More typical is malnutrition-associated hypoalbuminemia in the [[elderly]], who appear thin and frail but not with the rounded abdomen and edema seen in Kwashiorkor. Albumin is an acute negative phase respondent and not a reliable indicator of nutrition status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bharadwaj |first1=Shishira |last2=Ginoya |first2=Shaiva |last3=Tandon |first3=Parul |last4=Gohel |first4=Tushar D. |last5=Guirguis |first5=John |last6=Vallabh |first6=Hiren |last7=Jevenn |first7=Andrea |last8=Hanouneh |first8=Ibrahim |title=Malnutrition: laboratory markers vs nutritional assessment |journal=Gastroenterology Report |date=11 May 2016 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=272–280 |doi=10.1093/gastro/gow013 |pmid=27174435 |pmc=5193064 }}</ref>

Low albumin levels can also indicate chronic [[malnutrition]] from [[protein losing enteropathy]].<ref name=":0" /> This is often caused or exacerbated by [[ulcerative colitis]],<ref name="pmid22679407">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ungaro R, Babyatsky MW, Zhu H, Freed JS | title = Protein-losing enteropathy in ulcerative colitis | journal = Case Reports in Gastroenterology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–82 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22679407 | pmc = 3364098 | doi = 10.1159/000338191 }}</ref> but can also be seen in [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiac disease]] and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].<ref name=":0" /> Broadly, protein-losing enteropathy can be caused by increased lymphatic pressure in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] as in lymphangiectasis, mucosal erosion-induced lack of absorption as in [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]], and other diseases of malabsorption without mucosal erosions as in [[Coeliac disease|Celiac disease]].<ref name=":0" />

Eosinophilic [[gastritis]] presents with [[Abdominal pain|epigastric pain]], peripheral blood [[eosinophilia]], [[anemia]], and hypoalbuminemia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Margaret H.|last2=Capocelli|first2=Kelley|last3=Yang|first3=Guang-Yu|date=2017|title=Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders Pathology|journal=Frontiers in Medicine|volume=4|pages=261|doi=10.3389/fmed.2017.00261|issn=2296-858X|pmc=5775510|pmid=29379785|doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
The [[liver]] produces albumin and then secretes into the [[bloodstream]], where it is then distributed into tissues across the body. In the liver, the liver synthesizes albumin as pre-proalbumin, converts it first into proalbumin and then albumin in [[hepatocyte]]s, and releases it into the blood.<ref name=":1" /> The body synthesizes albumin at a rate of 10 to 15 grams per day. In the presence of hypoalbuminemia, the liver can increase production by as much as four times the baseline production rate.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Carvalho|first1=Joana R.|last2=Verdelho Machado|first2=Mariana|date=2018|title=New Insights About Albumin and Liver Disease|journal=Annals of Hepatology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=547–560|doi=10.5604/01.3001.0012.0916|issn=1665-2681|pmid=29893696|doi-access=free}}</ref> Once released, albumin distributes itself between the [[intravascular]] space (40%) in blood vessels, and [[extravascular]] spaces (60%) within the body's different tissues. In the blood plasma, albumin makes up 55 to 60% of total plasma protein by mass, with [[globulin]]s making up a large part of the rest. In hypoalbuminemia, the amount of albumin in the intravascular space or blood plasma is what is being measured, meaning that abnormal distribution within the two compartments may contribute to a relative hypoalbuminemia in the bloodstream with a normal level in the whole body.<ref name=":0" />

Once released into the body, albumin performs a number of functions that can be negatively affected by the reduced levels seen in hypoalbuminemia. These functions include regulation of [[colloid osmotic pressure]] or protein concentration within the blood plasma, transport of [[free fatty acids]] and other molecules to the liver ([[unconjugated bilirubin]], metals, ions) for storage or utilization, binding of drugs and alteration of [[pharmacokinetics]] ([[half-life]], biological activity levels, metabolism), buffering plasma [[pH]], scavenging [[reactive oxygen species]] to avoid [[inflammation]] and associated damage, functioning as a reservoir of [[nitric oxide]] for the regulation of [[blood pressure]], and prevention of [[coagulation]] and [[platelet aggregation]] in an action similar to the commonly used [[anticoagulant]] [[heparin]]. It also inhibits inflammatory mediators such as [[TNFα|TNF-α]] and [[Complement 5A|complement 5a]] (C5a) to reduce the overall inflammatory response.<ref name=":1" />

A number of [[hormone]]s (e.g. [[thyroxine]], [[cortisol]], [[testosterone]]), [[drug]]s, and other molecules are bound to albumin in the bloodstream and must be released from albumin before becoming biologically active. For example, calcium binds to albumin; in hypoalbuminemia, there is an increased amount of free ionized calcium, its biologically active form. In the presence of hypoalbuminemia, these functions are differentially affected, and the mechanisms by which they affect disease outcomes remains an area of active debate.<ref name=":0" />

== Diagnosis ==
The serum albumin level is part of a standard panel of [[liver function tests]] (LFT) that also includes levels of [[Blood proteins|plasma protein]], [[bilirubin]], [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT), and [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST). This is commonly ordered when liver disease is suspected as part of a [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP) in conjunction with the [[electrolyte]] panel known as the [[basic metabolic panel]] (BMP). In kidney disease, a CMP may be ordered as a follow-up test when [[proteinuria]] is detected by [[Urine dipstick|urine dipstick analysis]], which may lead to a diagnosis of hypoalbuminemia.<ref name=":0" /> Low levels of serum albumin are defined as less than 3.5 grams per deciliter, while clinically significant hypoalbuminemia is generally considered to be less than 2.5 grams per deciliter.<ref name=":1" /> Upon discovery of hypoalbuminemia, a common work-up will include [[liver function tests]] to assess for liver disease, urine albumin and protein levels to assess for albuminuria and nephrotic syndrome, and [[brain natriuretic peptide]] to assess for [[Heart failure|cardiac failure]].<ref name=":0" /> If [[Protein losing enteropathy|protein-losing enteropathy]] is suspected based on clinical suspicion, an [[alpha-1 antitrypsin]] test can be performed. If stool alpha-1 antitrypsin is elevated, this suggests excessive gastrointestinal protein loss.<ref name=":0" />

== Management ==
Treatment of hypoalbuminemia is largely focused on the underlying cause and not on the hypoalbuminemia itself.<ref name=":1" /> Albumin infusions can and are commonly performed although they are expensive and have not been shown to be more effective than [[colloid solution]]s in a number of conditions and situations. Examples of indications for albumin infusion include hypoalbuminemia in the context of major surgery such as hepatic resection >40%, nephrotic syndrome in conjunction with [[diuretic]]s and [[corticosteroid]]s, [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] in combination with [[antibiotic]]s, and rapidly progressing [[hepatorenal syndrome]] (type 1) in combination with [[terlipressin]].<ref name=":1" /> It is also used to prevent [[iatrogenic]] hypoalbuminemia after therapeutic [[plasmapheresis]] if volume plasma exchange is greater than 20 milliliters per kilogram in one session or over one week across multiple sessions and after large volume (>5 liter) [[paracentesis]] in [[ascites]].<ref name=":1" /> These indications have shown positive outcomes respective to their diseases, while conditions like [[Malnutrition|malnourishment]], [[burn]]s (during the first 24 hours), and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] with [[traumatic brain injury]] either show no benefit or harm in [[randomized controlled trial]]s.<ref name=":1" /> In liver disease and cirrhosis, in addition to the above indications, the use of albumin is being considered for [[bacterial infections]] other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and chronic ascites. Its use in these indications remains controversial.<ref name=":3" /> In kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome, albumin infusions as replacement for albumin loss to proteinuria is used in some cases of [[congenital nephrotic syndrome]].<ref name=":4" />

== Prognosis ==
By itself, low albumin levels are associated with increased [[mortality rate]] in the general population.<ref name=":3" /> In disease states specifically, hypoalbuminemia has been used a predictive factor for poor outcomes in a number of conditions,<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last1=Gounden|first1=Verena|title=Hypoalbuminemia|date=2019|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526080/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=30252336|access-date=2019-11-04|last2=Jialal|first2=Ishwarlal}}</ref> including periprosthetic joint infection treatment failure,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fagotti|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Tatka|first2=Jakub|last3=Salles|first3=Mauro Jose Costa|last4=Queiroz|first4=Marcelo C.|date=2018|title=Risk Factors and Treatment Options for Failure of a Two-Stage Exchange|journal=Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine|volume=11|issue=3|pages=420–427|doi=10.1007/s12178-018-9504-1|issn=1935-973X|pmc=6105486|pmid=29934884}}</ref> and [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=":3" /> Amongst patients admitted to [[intensive care unit]]s (ICUs), hypoalbuminemia is specifically associated with ICU-acquired [[muscle weakness]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barreiro|first=Esther|date=2018|title=Models of disuse muscle atrophy: therapeutic implications in critically ill patients|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|volume=6|issue=2|pages=29|doi=10.21037/atm.2017.12.12|issn=2305-5839|pmc=5799135|pmid=29430446 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In [[chronic kidney disease]], hypoalbuminemia is an indicator of [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]], which is itself associated with complications, [[mental distress]], [[quality of life]] impairment, resource utilization, and mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Patrick Yihong|last2=Chao|first2=Chia-Ter|last3=Chan|first3=Ding-Cheng|last4=Huang|first4=Jenq-Wen|last5=Hung|first5=Kuan-Yu|date=2019|title=Contributors, risk associates, and complications of frailty in patients with chronic kidney disease: a scoping review|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease|volume=10|pages=2040622319880382|doi=10.1177/2040622319880382|issn=2040-6223|pmc=6778996|pmid=31632625}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Hypoalbuminemia is commonly found in hospitalized patients, patients in the ICU, and the elderly within the hospital and the community.<ref name=":0" /> Amongst elderly patients, prevalence can be as high as 70%, as shown in a study from Southern Brasil.<ref name=":0" />
