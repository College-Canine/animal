In humans, the spleen is purple in color and is in the [[quadrant (anatomy)|left upper quadrant]] of the [[abdomen]].<ref name="Mebius" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Loscalzo, Joseph |author2=Fauci, Anthony S. |author3=Braunwald, Eugene |author4=Dennis L.

== Structure ==
The spleen is underneath the left part of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the diaphragm. It is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the [[stomach]]. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the [[pancreas]]. The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface, and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left [[adrenal gland]].

There are four ligaments attached to the spleen: [[gastrosplenic ligament]], splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament, and phrenocolic ligament.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ostermann |first1=P. A.

The spleen, in healthy adult humans, is approximately {{convert|7|to|14|cm|in|frac=2}} in length.

An easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1×3×5×7×9×10×11 rule. The spleen is {{convert|1|by|3|by|5|in|cm|0}}, weighs approximately {{cvt|7|oz|g}}, and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs on the left-hand side and along the axis of the 10th rib. The weight varies between {{cvt|1|oz|g}} and {{cvt|8|oz|g}} (standard [[reference range]]),<ref name="MolinaDiMaio2012">{{cite journal|last1=Molina|first1=D.

=== Blood supply ===
[[File:Gray1188.png|200px|thumb|Visceral surface of the spleen]]
Near the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]], which is the point of attachment for the [[gastrosplenic ligament]] and the point of insertion for the [[splenic artery]] and [[splenic vein]]. There are other openings present for [[lymphatic vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s. In addition to the splenic artery, collateral blood supply is provided by the adjacent short gastric arteries.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6730702/|title=The collateral arterial network of the spleen following ligation of the splenic artery in traumatic rupture of the spleen; an arteriographic study|date=1984 |pmid=6730702 |last1=Keramidas |first1=D.

Like the [[thymus]], the spleen possesses only [[efferent lymphatic vessels]]. The spleen is part of the [[lymphatic system]]. Both the [[short gastric arteries]] and the splenic artery supply it with blood.<ref>{{Cite book

=== Nerve supply ===
The spleen is innervated by the [[splenic plexus]], which connects a branch of the [[celiac ganglia]] to the [[vagus nerve]].

The underlying [[Central nervous system|central nervous]] processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis]], and the [[brainstem]], especially the [[subfornical organ]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lori|first1=Andrea|last2=Perrotta|first2=Marialuisa|last3=Lembo|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Carnevale|first4=Daniela|date=2017-06-07|title=The Spleen: A Hub Connecting Nervous and Immune Systems in Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=18|issue=6|page=1216|doi=10.3390/ijms18061216|issn=1422-0067|pmc=5486039|pmid=28590409|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Development ===
The spleen is unique in respect to its development within the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gut]]. While most of the gut [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are [[endodermally]] derived, the spleen is derived from [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tissue]].<ref>{{cite journal | last= Vellguth | first=Swantje |author2=Brita von Gaudecker |author3=Hans-Konrad Müller-Hermelink | title=The development of the human spleen | journal=[[Cell and Tissue Research]] | volume=242 | issue=3 | pages=579–92 | doi=10.1007/BF00225424 | pmid=4075378 | year= 1985 | s2cid=19864892 }}</ref> Specifically, the spleen forms within, and from, the [[dorsal mesentery]]. However, it still shares the same blood supply—the [[celiac trunk]]—as the [[foregut]] organs.

[[File:Red Pulp and White Pulp of the Spleen.jpg|thumb|right|The spleen contains two different tissues, white pulp (A) and red pulp (B). The white pulp functions in producing and growing immune and blood cells. The red pulp functions in filtering blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red blood cells.]]

=== Other ===
Other functions of the spleen are less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:
*Spleen produces all types of blood cells during fetal life
* Production of [[opsonin]]s, [[properdin]], and [[tuftsin]].
* Release of [[neutrophil]]s following myocardial infarction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvac012/6522118 |title=Rapid neutrophil mobilization by VCAM-1+ endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles &#124; Cardiovascular Research &#124; Oxford Academic |publisher=Academic.oup.com |date= |accessdate=2022-02-15}}</ref>
* Creation of [[red blood cell]]s. While the [[bone marrow]] is the primary site of [[hematopoiesis]] in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the 5th month of gestation. After birth, [[Erythropoiesis|erythropoietic]] functions cease, except in some hematologic disorders. As a major lymphoid organ and a central player in the [[reticuloendothelial system]], the spleen retains the ability to produce lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.
* Storage of [[red blood cell]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s and other formed elements. The spleen of horses stores roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed.<ref name="MSNBC2006-Carey">{{cite news | first=Bjorn | last=Carey | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12648465 | title=Horse science: What makes a Derby winner – Spleen acts as a 'natural blood doper,' scientist says | publisher=NBC News | date=May 5, 2006  | access-date=2006-05-09}}</ref> In humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and released in cases of [[hypovolemia]]<ref name="Spleen: Information, Surgery and Functions">{{cite web |url=https://chp.edu/CHP/organs+spleen+functions |title=Spleen: Information, Surgery and Functions |publisher=Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh |website= Chp.edu |date=2010-11-17 |access-date=2011-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926085253/http://www.chp.edu/CHP/organs+spleen+functions |archive-date=2011-09-26 }}</ref> and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lodin-Sundström|first1=Angelica|last2=Schagatay|first2=Erika|title=Spleen contraction during 20 min normobaric hypoxia and 2 min apnea in humans|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=June 2010|volume=8|issue=6|pages=545–49|doi=10.3357/ASEM.2682.2010|pmid=20540444}}</ref>  It can store [[platelets]] in case of an emergency and also clears old platelets from the circulation.

== Clinical significance ==
[[File:Spleen after spleenectomy.jpg|alt=Surgically removed spleen of a child with thalassemia. It is about 15 times larger than normal.|thumb|[[Thalassemia]] enlarged spleen taken after [[splenectomy]]]]

=== Enlarged spleen ===
{{Main|Splenomegaly}}

Enlargement of the spleen is known as [[splenomegaly]]. It may be caused by [[sickle cell anemia]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[malaria]], [[bacterial endocarditis]], [[leukemia]], [[polycythemia vera]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[Gaucher's disease]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[Banti's syndrome|Banti's disease]], [[hereditary spherocytosis]], [[cyst]]s, glandular fever (including [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] or 'Mono' caused by the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] and infection from [[Human betaherpesvirus 5|cytomegalovirus]]), and [[tumour]]s. Primary tumors of the spleen include [[hemangioma]]s and [[hemangiosarcoma]]s. Marked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.

The spleen is the largest collection of [[lymphoid tissue]] in the body. It is normally palpable in preterm infants, in 30% of normal, full-term [[neonates]], and in 5% to 10% of infants and toddlers. A spleen easily palpable below the [[costal margin]] in any child over the age of 3–4 years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.

Splenomegaly can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g., [[hemolytic anemia]]), or infiltration (e.g., [[leukemia]] or storage disease, such as [[Gaucher's disease]]). The most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. Basic work-up for acute splenomegaly includes a [[complete blood count]] with differential, platelet count, and [[reticulocyte]] and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia and leukemia. Assessment of [[IgM]] antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising [[titer]]) is indicated to confirm Epstein–Barr virus or [[Human betaherpesvirus 5|cytomegalovirus]]. Other infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.

=== Splenic injury ===
{{Main|Splenic injury}}
[[trauma (medicine)|Trauma]], such as a [[traffic collision|road traffic collision]], can cause [[ruptured spleen|rupture of the spleen]], which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.

=== Asplenia ===
{{Main|Asplenia}}

[[Asplenia]] refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be [[genetic disorder|congenital]], or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection ([[splenectomy]]) or a disease such as [[Sickle cell disease|sickle cell anaemia]]. Hyposplenia refers to a partially functioning spleen. These conditions may cause<ref name="Jia"/> a modest increase in circulating [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s, a diminished response to some [[vaccine]]s, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is an increased risk of [[sepsis]] from [[polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria]]. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. Phagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by [[immunoglobulin M|IgM]] [[memory B cell]]s (a subtype of [[B cell]]s) in the [[marginal zone]] of the spleen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Di Sabatino|first=A|author2=Carsetti, R |author3=Corazza, GR |title=Post-splenectomy and hyposplenic states|journal=Lancet|date=Jul 2, 2011|volume=378|issue=9785|pages=86–97|pmid=21474172|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61493-6|s2cid=30554953}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Carsetti|first=R|author2=Rosado, MM |author3=Wardmann, H |title=Peripheral development of B cells in mouse and man|journal=Immunological Reviews|date=February 2004|volume=197|pages=179–91|pmid=14962195|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0109.x|s2cid=20654498}}</ref>

[[Polysplenia]] is a congenital disease manifested by multiple small accessory spleens,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000085247|polysplenia}}</ref> rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen.  Polysplenia sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as [[intestinal malrotation]] or [[biliary atresia]], or cardiac abnormalities, such as [[dextrocardia]].

Splenic infarction occurs when the [[splenic artery]] or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a [[blood clot]]. Although it can occur [[asymptomatic]]ally, the typical symptom is severe [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[left upper quadrant (abdomen)|left upper quadrant of the abdomen]], sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nores |first1=M1 |last2=Phillips |first2=EH |last3=Morgenstern |first3=L |last4=Hiatt |first4=JR |date=February 1998 |title=The Clinical Spectrum of Splenic Infarction |journal=[[The American Surgeon]] |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=182–88 |pmid=9486895}}</ref> It has to be differentiated from other causes of [[acute abdomen]].

=== Hyaloserositis ===
The spleen may be affected by [[hyaloserositis]], in which it is coated with [[fibrosis|fibrous]] [[hyaline]].<ref name=omd>[http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?hyaloserositis "Hyaloserositis"].

== Society and culture ==
There has been a long and varied history of misconceptions regarding the physiological role of the spleen, and it has often been seen as a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion.<ref name=Riva2019>{{cite journal |vauthors=Riva MA, Ferraina F, Paleari A, Lenti MV, Di Sabatino A |title=From sadness to stiffness: the spleen's progress |journal=Internal and Emergency Medicine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=739–743 |date=2019 |pmid=31152307 |doi=10.1007/s11739-019-02115-2 |s2cid=172137672 |url=}}</ref> In various cultures, the organ has been linked to [[melancholia]], due to the influence of [[ancient Greek medicine]] and the associated doctrine of [[humourism]], in which the spleen was believed to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as "black bile" (one of the four humours).<ref name=Riva2019/> The spleen also plays an important role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], where it is considered to be [[Zang-fu|a key organ]] that displays the [[Yin and yang|Yin]] aspect of [[Earth (wuxing)|the Earth element]] (its Yang counterpart is the stomach).  In contrast, the [[Talmud]] (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of [[laughter]] while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.

Etymologically, ''spleen'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|σπλήν}} (''splḗn''), where it was the idiomatic equivalent of [[Heart (symbolism)|the heart]] in modern English. [[Persius]], in his satires, associated ''spleen'' with immoderate laughter.<ref name="Stanley2002"/>

In English, [[William Shakespeare]] frequently used the word ''spleen'' to signify [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], but also [[wikt:caprice|caprice]] and merriment.<ref name="Stanley2002"/> In ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', he uses the spleen to describe Cassius's irritable nature:

<blockquote><poem>Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.<ref>''Julius Caesar'' by William Shakespeare Act 4:1</ref></poem></blockquote>

The spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered an actual disease.<ref name=Bynum2002>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bynum B |title=The spleen |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |page=1624 |date=2002 |issue=9317 |pmid=12048004 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08479-9 |s2cid=33529100 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)08479-9/fulltext |url-access=registration}}</ref> In the early 18th century, the physician [[Richard Blackmore]] considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in England (along with [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]).<ref name=Bynum2002/> In 1701, [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]] (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had published a [[Ode|Pindaric ode]], ''The Spleen'', drawing on her first-hand experiences of an affliction which, at the time, also had a reputation of being a fashionably [[upper-class]] disease of the English.<ref name="Rogers1989">{{cite journal |last1=Rogers KM |title=Finch's "Candid Account" vs. Eighteenth–Century Theories of the Spleen |journal=Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature |date=1989 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |jstor=24780450 |issn=0027-1276}}</ref>  Both Blackmore and [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]] treated this malady as the male equivalent of "[[Vapours (disease)|the vapours]]", while preferring the more [[Learned medicine|learned]] terms "[[hypochondriasis]]" and "[[hysteria]]".<ref name=Bynum2002/><ref>[[George Cheyne (physician)|Cheyne, George]]: ''The English Malady; or, A Treatise of Nervous Diseases of All Kinds, as Spleen, Vapours, Lowness of Spirits, Hypochondriacal and Hysterical Distempers with the Author's Own Case at Large'', Dublin, 1733.

In [[French language|French]], "splénétique" refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. This usage was popularised by the poems of [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) and his collection ''[[Le Spleen de Paris]]'', but it was also present in earlier [[French Romanticism|19th-century Romantic literature]].

=== Food ===
The spleen is one of the many organs that may be included in [[offal]]. It is not widely eaten as a principal ingredient, but cow spleen sandwiches are eaten in [[Sicily|Sicilian]] cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/05/spleen-sandwiches-an-italian-tradition/39761/|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=2022-01-03|date=2010-05-03|first=Tejal|last=Rao|title=Spleen Sandwiches: An Italian Tradition}}</ref> Chicken spleen is one of the main ingredients of [[Jerusalem mixed grill]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/dining-out-mixed-jerusalem-grill-in-tel-aviv-1.216305 |title=Dining Out / Mixed Jerusalem grill in Tel Aviv |first=Daniel|last=Rogov |publisher=Haaretz |date=2007-03-22 |access-date=2022-01-03}}</ref>

In [[cartilaginous fish|cartilaginous]] and [[ray-finned fish]], the spleen consists primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the [[serosa]]l lining of the [[intestine]]. In many [[amphibian]]s, especially [[frog]]s, it has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia |pages= 410–11|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>

In [[reptile]]s, birds, and [[mammal]]s, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and some mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to the arrangement of the surrounding organs.  In most vertebrates, the spleen continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function is lost in middle-aged adults. Many mammals have tiny spleen-like structures known as [[haemal nodes]] throughout the body that are presumed to have the same function as the spleen.<ref name=VB/> The spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour. In [[cetacean]]s and [[manatee]]s they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving [[pinniped]]s, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.

Marsupials have y-shaped spleens, and it develops postnatally.<ref> {{cite journal |vauthors= Old JM, Selwood L, Deane EM | title= Development of the lymphoid tissues of the stripe-faced dunnart (''Sminthopsis macroura''). |journal=Cells Tissues Organs|year=2002| volume=175|issue=4|pages=192-201|doi=10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00310.x |pmc=1571326}}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |vauthors= Old JM, Selwood L, Deane EM | title= A developmental investigation of the liver, bone marrow and spleen of the stripe-faced dunnart  (''Sminthopsis macroura''). |journal=Developmental and Comparative Immunology. |year=2004| volume=28|issue=4|pages=347-355|doi=10.1016/j.dci.2003.08.004  }}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |vauthors= Old JM, Selwood L, Deane EM | title= The appearance and distribution of mature T and B cells in the developing immune tissues of the stripe-faced dunnart  (''Sminthopsis macroura''). |journal=Journal of Anatomy|year=2004| volume=205|issue=1|pages=25-33|doi=10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00310.x  |pmc=1571326}}</ref><ref> {{cite journal |vauthors= Old JM, Deane EM | title= The detection of mature T and B-cells during development of the lymphoid tissues of the tammar wallaby (''Macropus eugenii''). |journal=Cells Tissues Organs|year=2003| volume=203|issue=1|pages=123-131|doi=10.1046/j.1469-7580.2003.00207.x  |pmc=1571143}}</ref>

The only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the [[lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]]es (the early-branching [[Cyclostomata]], or [[jawless fishes]]). Even in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the spleen of higher vertebrates.<ref name=VB/>

In mice, the spleen stores half the body's [[monocyte]]s so that, upon injury, they can migrate to the injured tissue and transform into [[dendritic cell]]s and [[macrophage]]s to assist [[wound healing]].<ref name="Swirski">{{Cite journal|pmid=19644120|year=2009|last1=Swirski|first1=FK|last2=Nahrendorf|first2=M|last3=Etzrodt|first3=M|last4=Wildgruber|first4=M|last5=Cortez-Retamozo|first5=V|last6=Panizzi|first6=P|last7=Figueiredo|first7=JL|last8=Kohler|first8=RH|last9=Chudnovskiy|first9=A|last10=Waterman|first10=P|last11=Aikawa|first11=E|last12=Mempel|first12=TR|last13=Libby|first13=P|last14=Weissleder|first14=R|last15=Pittet|first15=MJ|title=Identification of splenic reservoir monocytes and their deployment to inflammatory sites|volume=325|issue=5940|pages=612–16|doi=10.1126/science.1175202|pmc=2803111|journal=Science|bibcode=2009Sci...325..612S}}</ref>
