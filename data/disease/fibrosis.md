'''Fibrosis''', also known as '''fibrotic scarring''', is a pathological [[wound healing]] in which [[connective tissue]] replaces normal [[parenchymal tissue]] to the extent that it goes unchecked, leading to considerable tissue remodelling and the formation of permanent [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]].<ref name="Wynn 2004 pp. 583–594">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wynn TA | title = Fibrotic disease and the T(H)1/T(H)2 paradigm | journal = Nature Reviews.

Repeated injuries, [[chronic inflammation]] and repair are susceptible to fibrosis, where an accidental excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as the collagen, is produced by fibroblasts, leading to the formation of a permanent fibrotic scar.<ref name="Wynn 2004 pp. 583–594"/>

In response to injury, this is called [[scar]]ring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a [[fibroma]]. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can interfere with or totally inhibit the normal architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html | title = Glossary of dermatopathological terms. | work = DermNet NZ}}</ref> Defined by the pathological accumulation of [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected {{nowrap|tissue{{hsp}}{{mdash}}}}{{hsp}}it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.<ref name="pmid26435749">{{cite journal | vauthors = Neary R, Watson CJ, Baugh JA | title = Epigenetics and the overhealing wound: the role of DNA methylation in fibrosis | journal = Fibrogenesis & Tissue Repair | volume = 8 | pages = 18 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26435749 | pmc = 4591063 | doi = 10.1186/s13069-015-0035-8 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Physiology==
Fibrosis is similar to the process of scarring, in that both involve stimulated [[fibroblast]]s laying down [[connective tissue]], including [[collagen]] and [[glycosaminoglycan]]s. The process is initiated when immune cells such as [[macrophage]]s release soluble factors that stimulate fibroblasts.  The most well characterized pro-fibrotic mediator is [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF beta]], which is released by macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called [[Interstitial fluid|interstitium]].   Other soluble mediators of fibrosis include [[CTGF]], [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF), and [[interleukin 10]] (IL-10). These initiate signal transduction pathways such as the AKT/mTOR<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitra A, Luna JI, Marusina AI, Merleev A, Kundu-Raychaudhuri S, Fiorentino D, Raychaudhuri SP, Maverakis E | display-authors = 6 | title = Dual mTOR Inhibition Is Required to Prevent TGF-β-Mediated Fibrosis: Implications for Scleroderma | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 135 | issue = 11 | pages = 2873–2876 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26134944 | pmc = 4640976 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2015.252 }}</ref> and SMAD<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leask A, Abraham DJ | title = TGF-beta signaling and the fibrotic response | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 816–827 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15117886 | doi = 10.1096/fj.03-1273rev | doi-access = free | s2cid = 2027993 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.314.4027 }}</ref>  pathways that ultimately lead to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissue.  This process of tissue repair is a complex one, with tight regulation of [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) synthesis and degradation ensuring maintenance of normal tissue architecture. However, the entire process, although necessary,  can lead to a progressive irreversible fibrotic response if tissue injury is severe or repetitive, or if the wound healing response itself becomes deregulated.<ref name="pmid26435749"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer KC | title = Pulmonary fibrosis, part I: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis | journal = Expert Review of Respiratory Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 343–359 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28345383 | doi = 10.1080/17476348.2017.1312346 | s2cid = 42073964 }}</ref>

==Anatomical location==
Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, typically as a result of inflammation or damage. Common sites of fibrosis include the lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, and heart:
[[Image:Cirrhosis high mag.jpg|right|thumb|Micrograph showing cirrhosis of the liver. The tissue in this example is stained with a trichrome stain, in which fibrosis is colored blue. The red areas are the nodular liver tissue]]

=== Lungs ===
* [[Fibrothorax]]
* [[Pulmonary fibrosis]]
** [[Cystic fibrosis]]
** [[Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] (''idiopathic'' meaning 'of unknown cause')
* [[Radiation-induced lung injury]] (following radiation therapies commonly used to treat cancer)

=== Liver ===
* [[Bridging fibrosis]] – an advanced stage of liver fibrosis, seen in the progressive form of chronic liver diseases. The term ''bridging'' refers to the formation of a "bridge" by a band of mature and thick fibrous tissue from the portal area to the central vein. This form of fibrosis leads to the formation of pseudolobules. Long-term exposure to [[hepatotoxins]], such as [[thioacetamide]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], and [[diethylnitrosamine]], has been shown to cause bridging fibrosis in experimental animal models.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dwivedi DK, Jena GB | title = Glibenclamide protects against thioacetamide-induced hepatic damage in Wistar rat: investigation on NLRP3, MMP-2, and stellate cell activation | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 391 | issue = 11 | pages = 1257–1274 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30066023 | doi = 10.1007/s00210-018-1540-2 | s2cid = 51890984 }}</ref>
