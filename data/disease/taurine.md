'''Taurine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|iː|n}}), or '''2-aminoethanesulfonic acid''', is a [[Non-proteinogenic amino acids|non-proteinogenic naturally occurred amino sulfonic acid]] that is widely distributed in animal tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuller-Levis GB, Park E | title = Taurine: new implications for an old amino acid | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 226 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–202 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14553911 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00611-6 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It is a major constituent of [[bile]] and can be found in the [[large intestine]], and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight.

===Synthesis===
Synthetic taurine is obtained by the [[ammonolysis]] of [[isethionic acid]] (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of [[ethylene oxide]] with aqueous [[sodium bisulfite]]. A direct approach involves the reaction of [[aziridine]] with [[sulfurous acid]].<ref>{{Ullmann | vauthors = Kosswig K |title=Sulfonic Acids, Aliphatic|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_503|isbn=978-3-527-30673-2}}</ref>

In the laboratory, taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marvel CS, Bailey CF, Cortese F |year= 1938 |title= Taurine |journal=Organic Syntheses |volume= 18 |page= 77 |doi= 10.15227/orgsyn.018.0077}}</ref>

===Biosynthesis===
Taurine is naturally derived from [[cysteine]]. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the [[pancreas]] via the [[cysteine sulfinic acid]] pathway. In this pathway, [[cysteine]] is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme [[cysteine dioxygenase]]. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is [[Decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] by [[sulfinoalanine decarboxylase]] to form [[hypotaurine]]. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by [[hypotaurine dehydrogenase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sumizu K | title = Oxidation of hypotaurine in rat liver | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 63 | pages = 210–212 | date = September 1962 | pmid = 13979247 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(62)90357-8 }}</ref>

Taurine is also produced by the [[transsulfuration pathway]], which converts [[homocysteine]] into [[cystathionine]]. The cystathionine is then converted to [[hypotaurine]] by the sequential action of three enzymes: [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]], [[cysteine dioxygenase]], and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ripps H, Shen W | title = Review: taurine: a "very essential" amino acid | journal = Molecular Vision | volume = 18 | pages = 2673–2686 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23170060 | pmc = 3501277 }}</ref>

===Breast milk===
Prematurely born infants are believed to lack the enzymes needed to convert [[cystathionine]] to [[cysteine]], and may, therefore, become deficient in taurine. Taurine is present in [[breast milk]], and has been added to many infant formulas, as a measure of prudence, since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heird WC | title = Taurine in neonatal nutrition – revisited | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood.

==Research==
Taurine is not regarded as an [[essential nutrient|essential human dietary nutrient]] and has not been assigned recommended intake levels.<ref name=fda/> High-quality clinical studies to determine possible effects of taurine in the body or following dietary supplementation are absent from the literature.<ref name=drugs/> Preliminary human studies on the possible effects of taurine supplementation have been inadequate due to low subject numbers, inconsistent designs, and variable doses.<ref name=drugs/>

==Safety and toxicity==
According to the European Food Safety Authority ({{Abbreviation|EFSA|European Food Safety Authority}}), taurine is "considered to be a skin and eye irritant and skin sensitiser, and to be hazardous if inhaled;" it may be safe to consume up to 6 grams of taurine per day.<ref name=efsa/> Other sources indicate that taurine is safe for  supplemental intake in normal healthy adults at up to 3&nbsp;grams per day.<ref name=drugs/><ref name="pmid18325648">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shao A, Hathcock JN | title = Risk assessment for the amino acids taurine, L-glutamine and L-arginine | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 376–399 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18325648 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.01.004 | quote = the newer method described as the Observed Safe Level (OSL) or Highest Observed Intake (HOI) was utilized.

=== Other mammals ===
A number of other mammals also have a requirement for taurine. While the majority of dogs can synthesize taurine, case reports have described a singular [[American cocker spaniel]], 19 [[Newfoundland dog]]s, and a family of [[golden retriever]]s suffering from taurine deficiency treatable with supplementation. [[Fox]]es on [[fur farm]]s also appear to require dietary taurine. The [[rhesus monkey|rhesus]], [[cebus]] and [[cynomolgus]] monkeys each require taurine at least in infancy.<!-- Do I try to stress that this does not apply to human infants here?

=== Birds ===
Taurine appears to be essential for the development of [[passerine]] birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich [[spider]]s to feed their young, particularly just after hatching. Researchers compared the behaviours and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found the juveniles fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks. Under natural conditions, each [[blue tit]] nestling receive {{val|1|u=mg}} of taurine per day from parents.<ref name=Arnold2007>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold KE, Ramsay SL, Donaldson C, Adam A | title = Parental prey selection affects risk-taking behaviour and spatial learning in avian offspring | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 274 | issue = 1625 | pages = 2563–2569 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17698490 | pmc = 2275882 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.0687 }}</ref>

Taurine can be synthesized by chickens. Supplementation has no effect on chickens raised under adequate lab conditions, but seems to help with growth under stresses such as heat and dense housing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surai |first1=P.F. |last2=Kochish |first2=I.I. |last3=Kidd |first3=M.T. |title=Taurine in poultry nutrition |journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology |date=February 2020 |volume=260 |pages=114339 |doi=10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.114339|s2cid=209599794 }}</ref>

=== Fish ===
Species of fish, mostly carnivorous ones, show reduced growth and survival when the fish-based feed in their food is replaced with soy meal or feather meal. Taurine has been identified as the factor responsible for this phenomenon; supplementation of taurine to plant-based fish feed reverses these effects. Future aquaculture is expected to use more of these more environmentally-friendly protein sources, so supplementation would become more important.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Salze |first1=Guillaume P. |last2=Davis |first2=D. Allen |title=Taurine: a critical nutrient for future fish feeds |journal=Aquaculture |date=February 2015 |volume=437 |pages=215–229 |doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.12.006 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2015Aquac.437..215S }}</ref>

The need of taurine in fish is conditional, differing by species and growth stage. The [[Olive flounder]], for example, has lower capacity to synthesize taurine compared to the [[rainbow trout]]. Juvenile fish are less efficient at taurine biosyntheis due to reduced [[sulfinoalanine decarboxylase|cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sampath |first1=W. W. H.
