'''''Neospora caninum''''' is a [[coccidia]]n [[parasite]] that was identified as a species in 1988.

==Life cycle and transmission==
''Neospora caninum'' has a [[heteroxenous]] life cycle, with the sexually reproductive stage occurring in the intestine of a [[definitive host]].  Until recently, the only known definitive host was the domestic [[dog]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McAllister MM, Dubey JP, Lindsay DS, Jolley WR, Wills RA, McGuire AM |title=Dogs are definitive hosts of ''Neospora caninum'' |journal=Int J Parasitol |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1473–8 |date=Sep 1998 |pmid=9770635 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(98)00138-6 }}</ref> New research has determined that other canids such as [[coyotes]] (''Canis latrans''), [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), and Australian [[dingos]] (''Canis lupus dingo'') are also definitive hosts.<ref name="Dubey 2011">{{cite journal|last=Dubey|first=JP|author2=MC Jenkins |author3=C Rajendran |author4=K Miska |author5=LR Ferreira |author6=J Martins |author7=OCH Kwok |author8=S Choudhary |title=Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) is a natural definitive host for ''Neospora caninum''|journal=Veterinary Parasitology|date=September 2011|volume=181|issue=2–4|pages=382–387|doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.05.018|pmid=21640485|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259437}}</ref><ref name="Gondim et al 2004">{{cite journal|last=Gondim|first=LFP|author2=MM McAllister |author3=WC Pitt |author4=DE Zemlicka |title=Coyotes (Canis latrans) are definitive hosts of Neospora caniinum.|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|date=February 2004|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–161|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2004.01.001|pmid=15037103|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1373&context=icwdm_usdanwrc}}</ref><ref name="King et al., 2010">{{cite journal|last=King|first=JS|author2=Slapeta J |author3=Jenkins DJ |author4=Al-Qassab SE |author5=Ellis JT |author6=Windsor PA |title=Australian dingoes are definitive hosts of ''Neospora caninum''|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|date=July 2010|volume=40|issue=8|pages=945–950|pmid=20149793|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.01.008}}</ref>

[[Oocyst]]s passed in the feces of the [[definitive host]], such as canines or canids, are ingested by an [[intermediate host]], such as cattle. After ingestion of an oocyst, motile and rapidly dividing tachyzoites are released. These tachyzoites disseminate throughout the host, and in response to the host immune response, differentiate into bradyzoites, which form cysts in muscle and tissue. Formation of these cysts results in chronic infection of the intermediate host.  Ingestion of infected intermediate host tissue by the definitive host completes the life cycle. A second route of transmission is the congenital transmission from mother to offspring.<ref name="USDA">{{cite web |url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=11007|title=Neosporosis |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=November 7, 2005 |website=United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service |publisher=USDA |access-date=26 November 2013}}</ref>   [[Transplacental]] transmission (passage from mother to offspring during pregnancy) has also been shown to occur in dogs, cats, sheep and cattle. If the intermediate host acquires the disease during pregnancy, it activates these cysts, and active infection often causes spontaneous abortion.<ref name="USDA" />  In addition, if the aborted fetus and membranes are then eaten by the definitive host, they cause further infection and the cycle is complete.    Other [[carnivore]]s, for example the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), may also be intermediate hosts, but they are not known to be definitive hosts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Almería S, Ferrer D, Pabón M, Castellà J, Mañas S |title=Red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes'') are a natural intermediate host of ''Neospora caninum'' |journal=Vet.

The discovery that coyotes are definitive hosts may increase the risk of transmission of ''N. caninum'' to domestic livestock as well as to wild [[ruminant]]s such as [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'').<ref name="Gondim et al, Dec. 2004">{{cite journal|last=Gondim|first=LFP|author2=McAllister MM|author3=Mateus-Pinilla NE|author4=Pitt WC|author5=Mech LD|author6=Nelson ME|title=Transmission of ''Neospora caninum'' between wild and domestic animals|journal=[[Journal of Parasitology]]|date=December 2004|volume=90|issue=6|pages=1361–1365|url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/20958/PDF|access-date=2018-02-23|jstor=3286228|doi=10.1645/GE-341R|pmid=15715229|s2cid=15705809 }}</ref> Coyote range now includes most of North and Central America.<ref name="Gondim et al 2004" />  Studies suggest that the parasite may be widespread among wildlife and that infection cycles cross over between wild and domestic animals.<ref name="Gondim et al, Dec. 2004" />
