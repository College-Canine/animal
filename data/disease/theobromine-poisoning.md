[[File:Theobromin - Theobromine.svg|thumb|Structure of [[theobromine]] ([[IUPAC]] name: 3,7-dimethyl-1''H''-purine-2,6-dione)]]

'''Theobromine poisoning''', also informally called '''chocolate poisoning''' or '''cocoa poisoning''', is an overdosage reaction to the [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]] [[theobromine]], found in [[chocolate]], [[tea]], [[cola]] beverages,<ref name="GennaroAbrigo1992">{{cite journal|last1=Gennaro|first1=M. C.|last2=Abrigo|first2=C.|title=Caffeine and theobromine in coffee, tea and cola-beverages or any other fizzy drinks |journal=Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry|volume=343|issue=6|year=1992|pages=523–525|issn=0937-0633|doi=10.1007/BF00322162|s2cid=102045933}}</ref> and some other foods.

==Sources==
[[Cocoa powder]] contains about {{val|2.1|s=%}} theobromine by [[weight]],<ref>{{cite web |title=FoodData Central |url=https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169593/nutrients |website=fdc.nal.usda.gov}}</ref> so {{cvt|14|g|oz|1|lk=on}} of raw cocoa contains approximately {{val|0.3|ul=g}} theobromine.

Processed chocolate, in general, has smaller amounts. The amount found in highly refined chocolate candies or sweets (typically {{cvt|1.4|-|2.1|g/kg|mg/oz|disp=or}}) is much lower than that of [[Types of chocolate#Classification|dark chocolate]] or unsweetened [[baking chocolate]] ({{val|14|p=>|ul=g|upl=kg}} or {{val|400|p=>|ul=mg|upl=oz}}).

==In species==

===Humans===

====Pharmacology====
Theobromine has a half-life of {{val|10|end=&nbsp;[[hour]]s}}, but over {{val|16|ul=%}} may be unmodified {{val|48|u=h}} after a single dose of {{cvt|10|mg/kg}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martínez-Pinilla |first1=E |last2=Oñatibia-Astibia |first2=A |last3=Franco |first3=R |title=The relevance of theobromine for the beneficial effects of cocoa consumption. |journal=Frontiers in Pharmacology |date=2015 |volume=6 |pages=30 |doi=10.3389/fphar.2015.00030 |pmid=25750625 |pmc=4335269|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In general, the amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can be safely consumed by [[human]]s with a negligible risk of poisoning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+7332|title=3,7-Dimethylxanthine: Theobromine|publisher=[[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]], Toxnet, US National Library of Medicine|date=1 December 2017|access-date=7 November 2018|archive-date=4 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204061343/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+7332|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Toxicity====
Theobromine doses at {{val|0.8|–|1.5|u=g}} per day, such as may be found in {{cvt|50|–|100|g}} of cocoa powder may be accompanied by sweating, trembling and severe [[migraine|headaches]]. These are the mild-to-moderate symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} 

The severe symptoms are cardiac [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parasramka |first1=S |last2=Dufresne |first2=A |title=Supraventricular tachycardia induced by chocolate: is chocolate too sweet for the heart? |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 2012 |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=1325.e5–7 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2011.06.032 |pmid=21871761}}</ref> [[Seizure|epileptic seizures]], [[internal bleeding]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], and eventually [[death]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Limited mood effects were shown at {{val|250|u=mg}} per day.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===In other species===

====Toxicity====
Median lethal ({{LD50}}) doses of theobromine have only been published for cats, dogs, rats, and mice; these differ by a factor of 6 across species.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chambers |first1=Michael |title=ChemIDplus - Theobromine (natural) - YAPQBXQYLJRXSA-UHFFFAOYSA-N - Theobromine [INN:BAN:NF] - Similar structures search, synonyms, formulas, resource links, and other chemical information. |url=https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/name/theobromine%20(natural) |website=chem.nlm.nih.gov |language=en}}</ref>

Serious poisoning happens more frequently in domestic animals, which [[metabolize]] theobromine much more slowly than humans,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=Fiona|last2=Guiton|first2=Simon|date=2005-09-17|title=Chocolate poisoning|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=331|issue=7517|pages=633|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1215566|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7517.633}}</ref> and can easily consume enough chocolate to cause poisoning.

In dogs, the [[biological half-life]] of theobromine is 17.5 hours; in severe cases, clinical symptoms of theobromine poisoning can persist for 72 hours.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sharon |last=Gwaltney-Brant |url=http://www.aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/m-toxbrief_0201_0.pdf |title=Chocolate Intoxication |publisher=Veterinary Medicine Publishing Group |date=February 2001 |access-date=April 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222043717/http://www.aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/m-toxbrief_0201_0.pdf }}</ref> Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmic]]s for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmia]]s, and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]]. Theobromine is also suspected to induce [[cardiomyopathy|right atrial cardiomyopathy]] after long term exposure at levels equivalent to approximately {{cvt|15|g/kg}} of dark chocolate per day.<ref>{{cite journal|last=H.

====Wildlife====
In 2014, four [[American black bear]]s were found dead at a bait site in [[New Hampshire]]. A [[Autopsy|necropsy]] and [[toxicology]] report performed at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in 2015 confirmed they died of [[heart failure]] caused by theobromine after they consumed {{cvt|90|lb|order = flip}} of chocolate and doughnuts placed at the site as bait. A similar incident killed a black bear cub in [[Michigan]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/4-bears-die-of-chocolate-overdoses-expert-proposes-ban/ar-AA8tCqh|title=4 bears die of chocolate overdoses; expert proposes ban|website=Msn.com|access-date=23 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624173515/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/4-bears-die-of-chocolate-overdoses-expert-proposes-ban/ar-AA8tCqh|archive-date=24 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Pest control====
{{see also|Pest control#Poisoned bait}}

In previous research, the [[USDA]] investigated the possible use of theobromine as a toxicant to control [[coyotes]] preying on [[livestock]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=John J. |last=Johnston |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=icwdm_usdanwrc |title=Evaluation of Cocoa- and Coffee-Derived Methylxanthines as Toxicants for the Control of Pest Coyotes |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=4069–75 |journal=[[Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry]] |year=2005 |access-date=July 28, 2009 |pmid=15884841 |doi=10.1021/jf050166p |archive-date=February 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226020713/http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=icwdm_usdanwrc |url-status=live }}</ref>
