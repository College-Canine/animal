'''''Aspergillus fumigatus''''' is a species of fungus in the genus ''[[Aspergillus]]'', and is one of the most common ''Aspergillus'' species to cause disease in individuals with an [[immunodeficiency]].

''Aspergillus fumigatus'', a [[saprotroph]] widespread in nature, is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter, such as [[compost]] heaps, where it plays an essential role in [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] recycling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang W, Latgé JP | title = Microbe Profile: Aspergillus fumigatus: a saprotrophic and opportunistic fungal pathogen | journal = Microbiology | volume = 164 | issue = 8 | pages = 1009–1011 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30066670 | pmc = 6152418 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.000651 }}</ref> Colonies of the fungus produce from [[conidiophore]]s; thousands of minute grey-green [[conidia]] (2–3 μm) which readily become airborne. For many years, ''A. fumigatus'' was thought to only reproduce asexually, as neither mating nor [[meiosis]] had ever been observed. In 2008, ''A. fumigatus'' was shown to possess a fully functional sexual reproductive cycle, 145 years after its original description by Fresenius.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Gorman CM, Fuller H, Dyer PS | title = Discovery of a sexual cycle in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus | journal = Nature | volume = 457 | issue = 7228 | pages = 471–4 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19043401 | doi = 10.1038/nature07528 | bibcode = 2009Natur.457..471O | s2cid = 4371721 }}</ref> Although ''A. fumigatus'' occurs in areas with widely different climates and environments, it displays low genetic variation and a lack of population genetic differentiation on a global scale.<ref name="pmid16607012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rydholm C, Szakacs G, Lutzoni F | title = Low genetic variation and no detectable population structure in aspergillus fumigatus compared to closely related Neosartorya species | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 650–7 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16607012 | pmc = 1459663 | doi = 10.1128/EC.5.4.650-657.2006 }}</ref> Thus, the capability for sex is maintained, though little genetic variation is produced.

The fungus is capable of growth at {{convert|37|°C|°F|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} ([[normal human body temperature]]), and can grow at temperatures up to {{convert|50|°C|°F|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, with conidia surviving at {{convert|70|°C|°F|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}—conditions it regularly encounters in self-heating compost heaps. Its spores are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and everybody inhales an estimated several hundred spores each day; typically, these are quickly eliminated by the immune system in healthy individuals. In [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and people with AIDS or [[leukemia]], the fungus is more likely to become [[pathogenic]], over-running the host's weakened defenses and causing a range of diseases generally termed [[aspergillosis]]. Due to the recent increase in the use of immunosuppressants to treat human illnesses, it is estimated that A. fumigatus may be responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually with a mortality rate between 25 and 90%.<ref name="pmid28203225">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dhingra S, Cramer RA | title = Regulation of Sterol Biosynthesis in the Human Fungal Pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus: Opportunities for Therapeutic Development | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 8 | pages = 92 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28203225 | pmc = 5285346 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2017.00092 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Several [[virulence factor]]s have been postulated to explain this [[Opportunistic infection|opportunistic]] behaviour.<ref name="pmid20974273">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abad A, Fernández-Molina JV, Bikandi J, Ramírez A, Margareto J, Sendino J, Hernando FL, Pontón J, Garaizar J, Rementeria A | display-authors = 6 | title = What makes Aspergillus fumigatus a successful pathogen?

===Innate immune response===
Inhalational exposure to airborne conidia is continuous due to their ubiquitous distribution in the environment. However, in healthy individuals, the innate immune system is an efficacious barrier to ''A. fumigatus'' infection.<ref name="pmid19403905" /> A large portion of inhaled conidia are cleared by the mucociliary action of the respiratory epithelium.<ref name="pmid19403905" /> Due to the small size of conidia, many of them deposit in [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], where they interact with epithelial and innate effector cells.<ref name="pmid20618330" /><ref name="pmid19403905" /> [[Alveolar macrophage]]s phagocytize and destroy conidia within their [[phagosome]]s.<ref name="pmid20618330" /><ref name="pmid19403905" /> Epithelial cells, specifically type II pneumocytes, also internalize conidia which traffic to the [[lysosome]] where ingested conidia are destroyed.<ref name="pmid20618330" /><ref name="pmid19403905" /><ref name="pmid17196036">{{cite journal | vauthors = Filler SG, Sheppard DC | title = Fungal invasion of normally non-phagocytic host cells | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e129 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17196036 | pmc = 1757199 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.0020129 | doi-access = free }}</ref> First line immune cells also serve to recruit [[neutrophil]]s and other inflammatory cells through release of [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s induced by ligation of specific fungal motifs to [[pattern recognition receptor|pathogen recognition receptors]].<ref name="pmid19403905"/> Neutrophils are essential for aspergillosis resistance, as demonstrated in neutropenic individuals, and are capable of sequestering both conidia and [[hyphae]] through distinct, non-phagocytic mechanisms.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid17890370"/><ref name="pmid19403905"/> Hyphae are too large for cell-mediated internalization, and thus neutrophil-mediated [[NADPH oxidase|NADPH-oxidase]] induced damage represents the dominant host defense against hyphae.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid19403905"/> In addition to these cell-mediated mechanisms of elimination, antimicrobial peptides secreted by the airway epithelium contribute to host defense.<ref name="pmid20618330"/> The fungus and its polysaccharides have ability to regulate the functions of [[dendritic cell]]s by

===Invasion===
[[Image:Aspergillus fumigatus Invasive Disease Mechanism Diagram.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of invasive ''Aspergillus'' infection: Hyphae germinate either within an epithelial cell or within the alveoli. Hyphae extend through the epithelial cells, eventually invading and traversing endothelial cells of the vasculature. In rare cases, hyphal fragments break off and disseminate through the blood stream.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid17196036"/>]]
Immunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to invasive ''A. fumigatus'' infection, which most commonly manifests as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Inhaled conidia that evade host immune destruction are the progenitors of invasive disease. These conidia emerge from dormancy and make a morphological switch to hyphae by germinating in the warm, moist, nutrient-rich environment of the pulmonary alveoli.<ref name="pmid20618330"/> Germination occurs both extracellularly or in [[type II pneumocyte]] endosomes containing conidia.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid17196036"/> Following germination, filamentous hyphal growth results in epithelial penetration and subsequent penetration of the vascular endothelium.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid17196036"/> The process of angioinvasion causes endothelial damage and induces a proinflammatory response, [[tissue factor]] expression and activation of the [[coagulation]] cascade.<ref name="pmid20618330"/> This results in intravascular [[thrombosis]] and localized tissue [[infarction]], however, dissemination of hyphal fragments is usually limited.<ref name="pmid20618330"/><ref name="pmid17196036"/> Dissemination through the blood stream only occurs in severely immunocompromised individuals.<ref name="pmid17196036"/>

===Hypoxia response===
As is common with tumor cells and other pathogens, the invasive hyphae of ''A. fumigatus'' encounters hypoxic (low oxygen levels, ≤ 1%) micro-environments at the site of infection in the host organism.<ref name="pmid19462332">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grahl N, Cramer RA | title = Regulation of hypoxia adaptation: an overlooked virulence attribute of pathogenic fungi? | journal = Medical Mycology | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19462332 | pmc = 2898717 | doi = 10.3109/13693780902947342 }}</ref><ref name="Grahl_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grahl N, Shepardson KM, Chung D, Cramer RA | title = Hypoxia and fungal pathogenesis: to air or not to air? | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 560–70 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22447924 | pmc = 3346435 | doi = 10.1128/EC.00031-12 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20560863">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wezensky SJ, Cramer RA | title = Implications of hypoxic microenvironments during invasive aspergillosis | journal = Medical Mycology | volume = 49 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S120–4 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20560863 | pmc = 2951492 | doi = 10.3109/13693786.2010.495139 }}</ref> Current research suggests that upon infection, necrosis and inflammation cause tissue damage which decreases available oxygen concentrations due to a local reduction in [[perfusion]], the passaging of fluids to organs. In ''A. fumigatus'' specifically, secondary metabolites have been found to inhibit the development of new blood vessels leading to tissue damage, the inhibition of tissue repair, and ultimately localized hypoxic micro-environments.<ref name="Grahl_2012" /> The exact implications of hypoxia on fungal pathogenesis is currently unknown, however these low oxygen environments have long been associated with negative clinical outcomes. Due to the significant correlations identified between hypoxia, fungal infections, and negative clinical outcomes, the mechanisms by which ''A. fumigatus'' adapts in hypoxia is a growing area of focus for novel drug targets.

Two highly characterized sterol-regulatory element binding proteins, SrbA and SrbB, along with their processing pathways, have been shown to impact the fitness of ''A. fumigatus'' in hypoxic conditions. The transcription factor SrbA is the master regulator in the fungal response to hypoxia in vivo and is essential in many biological processes including iron homeostasis, [[Antimicrobial resistance|antifungal azole drug resistance]], and virulence.<ref name="Willger_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Willger SD, Puttikamonkul S, Kim KH, Burritt JB, Grahl N, Metzler LJ, Barbuch R, Bard M, Lawrence CB, Cramer RA | title = A sterol-regulatory element binding protein is required for cell polarity, hypoxia adaptation, azole drug resistance, and virulence in Aspergillus fumigatus | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = e1000200 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18989462 | pmc = 2572145 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000200 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Consequently, the loss of SrbA results in an inability for ''A. fumigatus'' to grow in low iron conditions, a higher sensitivity to anti-fungal azole drugs, and a complete loss of virulence in IPA (invasive pulmonary aspergillosis) mouse models.<ref name="Chung_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung D, Barker BM, Carey CC, Merriman B, Werner ER, Lechner BE, Dhingra S, Cheng C, Xu W, Blosser SJ, Morohashi K, Mazurie A, Mitchell TK, Haas H, Mitchell AP, Cramer RA | title = ChIP-seq and in vivo transcriptome analyses of the Aspergillus fumigatus SREBP SrbA reveals a new regulator of the fungal hypoxia response and virulence | journal = PLOS Pathogens | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = e1004487 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25375670 | pmc = 4223079 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004487 | doi-access = free }}</ref> SrbA knockout mutants do not show any signs of in vitro growth in low oxygen, which is thought to be associated with the attenuated virulence.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies with the SrbA protein led to the identification of a second hypoxia regulator, SrbB.<ref name="Chung_2014"/> Although little is known about the processing of SrbB, this transcription factor has also shown to be a key player in virulence and the fungal hypoxia response.<ref name="Chung_2014"/> Similar to SrbA, a SrbB knockout mutant resulted in a loss of virulence, however, there was no heightened sensitivity towards antifungal drugs nor a complete loss of growth under hypoxic conditions (50% reduction in SrbB rather than 100% reduction in SrbA).<ref name="Chung_2014"/><ref name="Willger_2008"/> In summary, both SrbA and SrbB have shown to be critical in the adaptation of ''A. fumigatus'' in the mammalian host.

===Nutrient acquisition===
''Aspergillus fumigatus'' must acquire nutrients from its external environment to survive and flourish within its host. Many of the genes involved in such processes have been shown to impact virulence through experiments involving genetic mutation. Examples of nutrient uptake include that of metals, nitrogen, and macromolecules such as peptides.<ref name="pmid17890370"/><ref name="pmid19597008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dagenais TR, Keller NP | title = Pathogenesis of Aspergillus fumigatus in Invasive Aspergillosis | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 447–65 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19597008 | pmc = 2708386 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00055-08 }}</ref>

==Current treatments to combat ''A. fumigatus'' infections==
Current noninvasive treatments used to combat fungal infections consist of a class of drugs known as azoles. [[Azole]] drugs such as [[voriconazole]], [[itraconazole]], and [[imidazole]] kill fungi by inhibiting the production of [[ergosterol]]—a critical element of fungal cell membranes. Mechanistically, these drugs act by inhibiting the fungal [[cytochrome p450]] enzyme known as [[Sterol 14-demethylase|14α-demethylase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Panackal AA, Bennett JE, Williamson PR | title = Treatment options in Invasive Aspergillosis | journal = Current Treatment Options in Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–325 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25328449 | pmc = 4200583 | doi = 10.1007/s40506-014-0016-2 }}</ref> However, ''A. fumigatus'' resistance to azoles is increasing, potentially due to the use of low levels of azoles in agriculture.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger S, El Chazli Y, Babu AF, Coste AT | title = Aspergillus fumigatus: A Consequence of Antifungal Use in Agriculture? | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 8 | pages = 1024 | date = 2017-06-07 | pmid = 28638374 | pmc = 5461301 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01024 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bueid A, Howard SJ, Moore CB, Richardson MD, Harrison E, Bowyer P, Denning DW | title = Azole antifungal resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus: 2008 and 2009 | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 2116–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20729241 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkq279 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The main mode of resistance is through mutations in the ''cyp51a'' gene.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nash A, Rhodes J | title = Simulations of CYP51A from Aspergillus fumigatus in a model bilayer provide insights into triazole drug resistance | journal = Medical Mycology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–373 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 28992260 | doi = 10.1093/mmy/myx056 | pmc = 5895076 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Snelders E, Karawajczyk A, Schaftenaar G, Verweij PE, Melchers WJ | title = Azole resistance profile of amino acid changes in Aspergillus fumigatus CYP51A based on protein homology modeling | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 2425–30 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20385860 | pmc = 2876375 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.01599-09 }}</ref> However, other modes of resistance have been observed accounting for almost 40% of resistance in clinical isolates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rybak JM, Ge W, Wiederhold NP, Parker JE, Kelly SL, Rogers PD, Fortwendel JR | title = hmg1, Challenging the Paradigm of Clinical Triazole Resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus | journal = mBio | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = e00437–19, /mbio/10/2/mBio.00437–19.atom | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30940706 | pmc = 6445940 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00437-19 | veditors = Alspaugh JA }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Camps SM, Dutilh BE, Arendrup MC, Rijs AJ, Snelders E, Huynen MA, Verweij PE, Melchers WJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Discovery of a HapE mutation that causes azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus through whole genome sequencing and sexual crossing | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e50034 | date = 2012-11-30 | pmid = 23226235 | pmc = 3511431 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0050034 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...750034C | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Furukawa T, van Rhijn N, Fraczek M, Gsaller F, Davies E, Carr P, Gago S, Fortune-Grant R, Rahman S, Gilsenan JM, Houlder E, Kowalski CH, Raj S, Paul S, Cook P, Parker JE, Kelly S, Cramer RA, Latgé JP, Moye-Rowley S, Bignell E, Bowyer P, Bromley MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = The negative cofactor 2 complex is a key regulator of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 427 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31969561 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-019-14191-1 | doi-access = free | pmc = 7194077 | bibcode = 2020NatCo..11..427F }}</ref> Along with azoles, other anti-fungal drug classes do exist such as [[Polyene antimycotic|polyenes]] and [[echinocandin]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}
