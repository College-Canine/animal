===Behavior changes===
A person's personality may be altered due to the tumor damaging lobes of the brain.

Personality changes can have damaging effects such as unemployment, unstable relationships, and a lack of control.<ref name=":02" />

==Cause==
The best known cause of brain cancers is ionizing radiation.<ref name=nrsCT1/><ref name="nrsIR1">Smoll NR, Brady Z, Scurrah K, Mathews JD. Exposure to ionizing radiation and brain cancer incidence: The Life Span Study cohort. Cancer Epidemiology. 2016 Jun;42:60–5.</ref> Approximately 4% of brain cancers in the general population are caused by CT scan radiation.<ref name="nrsCT1" /> For brain cancers that follow a CT scan at lags of 2 years or more, it has been estimated that 40% are attributable to CT scan radiation.<ref name="nrsCT1" /> The relationship between [[ionizing radiation]] and brain cancers can be best explained by [[Radiation-induced cancer|radiation carcinogenesis]], and traditional models of [[Carcinogenesis|oncogenesis]]. The [[Radiobiology|stochastic]] effects of ionizing radiation demonstrate a dose-response relationship to the probability of occurrence, but no dose-response relationship to severity of disease. The majority of [[Radiation-induced cancer|radiation-induced brain cancers]] are caused by ionizing radiation from medical sources such as [[CT scan|CT]] scans.

Mutations and deletions of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s, such as [[P53]], are thought to be the cause of some forms of brain tumor.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Kleihues P, Ohgaki H, Eibl RH, Reichel MB, Mariani L, Gehring M, Petersen I, Höll T, von Deimling A, Wiestler OD, Schwab M | chapter = Type and frequency of p53 mutations in tumors of the nervous system and its coverings | title = Molecular Neuro-oncology and Its Impact on the Clinical Management of Brain Tumors | pages = 25–31 | year = 1994 | publisher = Springer |isbn=978-3-540-57351-7 |series=Recent results in cancer research |volume=135}}</ref> Inherited conditions, such as [[Von Hippel–Lindau disease]], [[tuberous sclerosis]], [[multiple endocrine neoplasia]], and [[Neurofibromatosis|neurofibromatosis type 2]] carry a high risk for the development of brain tumors.<ref name=PDQ2014MD/><ref name=HodgsonNielsen2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodgson TS, Nielsen SM, Lesniak MS, Lukas RV | title = Neurological Management of Von Hippel-Lindau Disease | journal = The Neurologist | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 73–8 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27564075 | doi = 10.1097/NRL.0000000000000085 | s2cid = 29232748 | type = Review }}</ref><ref name=RogersBarani2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers L, Barani I, Chamberlain M, Kaley TJ, McDermott M, Raizer J, Schiff D, Weber DC, Wen PY, Vogelbaum MA | title = Meningiomas: knowledge base, treatment outcomes, and uncertainties.

==Pathophysiology==
===Meninges===
[[File:Meninges diagram.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The meninges lie between the skull and brain matter. Tumors originating from the meninges are meningiomas.]]
Human brains are surrounded by a system of [[connective tissue]] membranes called [[meninges]] that separate the [[Human brain|brain]] from the [[Human skull|skull]]. This three-layered covering is composed of (from the outside in) the [[dura mater]], [[arachnoid mater]], and [[pia mater]]. The arachnoid and pia are physically connected and thus often considered as a single layer, the ''leptomeninges''. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the [[subarachnoid space]] which contains [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). This fluid circulates in the narrow spaces between cells and through the cavities in the brain called [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], to support and protect the brain tissue. [[Blood vessels]] enter the [[central nervous system]] through the perivascular space above the pia mater. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly, forming the [[blood–brain barrier]] which protects the brain from [[toxins]] that might enter through the blood.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Clinically oriented anatomy| vauthors = Moore KL, Agur AM, Dalley II AF |isbn=978-1-4963-4721-3|edition= Eighth |location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|oclc=978362025|date = September 2017}}</ref>

Tumors of the meninges are [[meningioma]]s and are often benign. Though not technically a tumor of brain tissue, they are often considered brain tumors since they protrude into the space where the brain is, causing symptoms. Since they are usually slow-growing tumors, meningiomas can be quite large by the time symptoms appear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/meningioma-brain-tumor|title=Meningioma Brain Tumor|website=neurosurgery.ucla.edu|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref>

===Brain matter===
The brains of humans and other [[vertebrates]] are composed of very soft tissue and have a gelatin-like texture. Living brain tissue has a pink tint in color on the outside ([[grey matter|gray matter]]), and nearly complete white on the inside ([[white matter]]), with subtle variations in color. The three largest divisions of the brain are:
* [[Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex]]
* [[Brainstem]]
* [[Cerebellum]]<ref name=":7" />

These areas are composed of two broad classes of cells: [[neurons]] and [[glia]]. These two types are equally numerous in the brain as a whole, although [[glial cells]] outnumber [[neurons]] roughly 4 to 1 in the [[cerebral cortex]]. Glia come in several types, which perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://training.seer.cancer.gov/brain/tumors/anatomy/neurons.html|title=Neurons & Glial Cells {{!}} SEER Training|website=training.seer.cancer.gov|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Primary tumors of the glial cells are called [[glioma]]s and often are malignant by the time they are diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostrom QT, Gittleman H, Farah P, Ondracek A, Chen Y, Wolinsky Y, Stroup NE, Kruchko C, Barnholtz-Sloan JS | title = CBTRUS statistical report: Primary brain and central nervous system tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2006-2010 | journal = Neuro-Oncology | volume = 15 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = ii1-56 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24137015 | pmc = 3798196 | doi = 10.1093/neuonc/not151 }}</ref>

The [[brainstem]] lies between the large cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. It is divided into the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.<ref name=":7" />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Postermass.png|thumb|A posterior fossa tumor leading to mass effect and midline shift]]

Although there is no specific or singular symptom or sign, the presence of a combination of symptoms and the lack of corresponding indications of other causes can be an indicator for investigation towards the possibility of a brain tumor. Brain tumors have similar characteristics and obstacles when it comes to diagnosis and therapy with tumors located elsewhere in the body. However, they create specific issues that follow closely to the properties of the organ they are in.<ref name="Herholz" />

The diagnosis will often start by taking a [[medical history]] noting medical antecedents, and current symptoms. Clinical and laboratory investigations will serve to exclude infections as the cause of the symptoms. Examinations in this stage may include the eyes, [[otolaryngology|otolaryngological]] (or ENT) and electrophysiological exams. The use of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) often plays a role in the diagnosis of brain tumors.<ref name="Brandes_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandes AA, Pasetto LM, Lumachi F, Monfardini S | title = Endocrine dysfunctions in patients treated for brain tumors: incidence and guidelines for management | journal = Journal of Neuro-Oncology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–92 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10930105 | doi = 10.1023/a:1006471405435 | s2cid = 37522684 }}</ref>

Brain tumors, when compared to tumors in other areas of the body, pose a challenge for diagnosis. Commonly, [[radioactive tracer]]s are uptaken in large volumes in tumors due to the high activity of tumor cells, allowing for radioactive imaging of the tumor. However, most of the brain is separated from the blood by the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB), a membrane that exerts a strict control over what substances are allowed to pass into the brain. Therefore, many tracers that may reach tumors in other areas of the body easily would be unable to reach brain tumors until there was a disruption of the BBB by the tumor. Disruption of the BBB is well imaged via MRI or CT scan, and is therefore regarded as the main diagnostic indicator for malignant gliomas, meningiomas, and brain metastases.<ref name="Herholz">{{cite journal | vauthors = Herholz K, Langen KJ, Schiepers C, Mountz JM | title = Brain tumors | journal = Seminars in Nuclear Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 356–70 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23026359 | pmc = 3925448 | doi = 10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2012.06.001 }}</ref>

Swelling or obstruction of the passage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) from the brain may cause (early) signs of increased [[intracranial pressure]] which translates clinically into [[headaches]], [[vomiting]], or an altered state of [[consciousness]], and in children changes to the diameter of the [[human skull|skull]] and bulging of the [[fontanelle]]s. More complex symptoms such as endocrine dysfunctions should alarm doctors not to exclude brain tumors.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

A bilateral temporal [[visual field]] defect (due to compression of the [[optic chiasm]]) or dilation of the pupil, and the occurrence of either slowly evolving or the sudden onset of [[focal neurologic symptom]]s, such as [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] impairment (including impaired judgment, memory loss, lack of recognition, spatial orientation disorders), [[wikt:personality|personality]] or emotional changes, [[hemiparesis]], [[hypoesthesia]], [[aphasia]], [[ataxia]], [[visual field]] impairment, impaired sense of smell, impaired hearing, [[facial paralysis]], [[diplopia|double vision]], or more severe symptoms such as [[tremor]]s, paralysis on one side of the body [[hemiplegia]], or (epileptic) seizures in a patient with a negative history for epilepsy, should raise the possibility of a brain tumor.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Imaging===

[[Medical imaging]] plays a central role in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Early imaging methods&nbsp;– invasive and sometimes dangerous&nbsp;– such as [[pneumoencephalography]] and cerebral [[angiography]] have been abandoned in favor of non-invasive, high-resolution techniques, especially [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans,<ref name="cancer.gov"/> though MRI is typically the reference standard used.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iv M, Yoon BC, Heit JJ, Fischbein N, Wintermark M | title = Current Clinical State of Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Brain Tumor Diagnosis and Follow Up | journal = Seminars in Roentgenology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–61 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29405955 | doi = 10.1053/j.ro.2017.11.005 }}</ref> Neoplasms will often show as differently colored masses (also referred to as processes) in CT or MRI results.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}
* Benign brain tumors often show up as hypodense (darker than brain tissue) mass lesions on CT scans. On MRI, they appear either hypodense or isointense (same intensity as brain tissue) on [[spin-lattice relaxation|T1-weighted]] scans, or hyperintense (brighter than brain tissue) on [[spin-spin relaxation|T2-weighted]] MRI, although the appearance is variable.
* [[Contrast agent]] uptake, sometimes in characteristic patterns, can be demonstrated on either CT or MRI scans in most malignant primary and metastatic brain tumors.
* Pressure areas where the brain tissue has been compressed by a tumor also appear hyperintense on T2-weighted scans and might indicate the presence of a diffuse neoplasm due to an unclear outline. Swelling around the tumor known as ''peritumoral edema'' can also show a similar result. This is because these tumors disrupt the normal functioning of the BBB and lead to an increase in its permeability. 
More recently, advancements have been made to increase the utility of MRI in providing physiological data that can help to inform diagnosis and prognosis. MRI itself is sufficient in identifying the brain tumor's location and morphology, but other types of MRI may be used on top of that, such as MRA, MRS, pMRI, fMRI, and DWI. These imaging techniques help doctors and surgeons to diagnose the type of tumor, to plan for surgery, and to assess treatment and radiation/chemotherapy.
Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy can lead to treatment induced changes in the brain, visible on conventional imaging and which can be difficult to differentiate from tumor recurrence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Dennis |display-authors=et al |date=14 August 2020 |title=Brain Metastasis Recurrence Versus Radiation Necrosis: Evaluation and Treatment |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1042368020300590 |journal=Neurosurgery Clinics of North America |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=575–587 |doi=10.1016/j.nec.2020.06.007 |pmid=32921353 |s2cid=221674217 |via=Elsevier}}</ref>  

==== Different Types of MRI Scans ====
'''Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)'''{{snd}} looks at the blood vessels in the brain. In the diagnosis of brain tumor, MRAs are typically carried out before surgery to help surgeons get a better understanding of the tumor vasculature. For example, a study was done where surgeons were able to separate benign brain tumors from malignant ones by analyzing the shapes of the blood vessels that were extracted from MRA.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Bullitt E, Jung I, Muller K, Gerig G, Aylward S, Joshi S, Smith K, Lin W, Ewend M |title=Determining Malignancy of Brain Tumors by Analysis of Vessel Shape |date=2004 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30136-3_79 | conference = Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2004 |pages=645–653 |place=Berlin, Heidelberg |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-22977-3 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Although not required, some MRA may inject contrast agent, gadolinium, into the patient to get an enhanced image

'''Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)'''{{snd}} measures the metabolic changes or chemical changes inside the tumor. The most common MRS is proton spectroscopy with its frequency measured in parts per million (ppm). Gliomas or malignant brain tumors have different spectra from normal brain tissue in that they have greater choline levels and lower N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) signals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horská A, Barker PB | title = Imaging of brain tumors: MR spectroscopy and metabolic imaging | journal = Neuroimaging Clinics of North America | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–310 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20708548 | doi = 10.1016/j.nic.2010.04.003 | pmc = 2927327 }}</ref> Using MRS in brain tumor diagnosis can help doctors identify the type of tumor and its aggressiveness. For example, benign brain tumors or meningioma have increased alanine levels. It can also help to distinguish brain tumors from scar tissues or dead tissues caused by previous radiation treatment, which does not have increased choline levels<ref>{{Cite web |title=MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) |url=https://mayfieldclinic.com/pe-mrspectroscopy.htm |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=mayfieldclinic.com |language=EN}}</ref> that brain tumors have, and from tumor-mimicking lesions such as abscesses or infarcts.

'''Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (pMRI)'''{{snd}} assess the blood volume and blood flow of different parts of the brain and brain tumors. pMRI requires the injection of contrast agent, usually gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) into the veins in order to enhance the contrast. pMRI provides a cerebral blood volume map that shows the tumor vascularity and angiogenesis. Brain tumors would require a larger blood supply and thus, would show a high cerebral blood volume on the pMRI map. The vascular morphology and degree of angiogenesis from pMRI help to determine the grade and malignancy of brain tumors. For brain tumor diagnosis, pMRI is useful in determining the best site to perform biopsy and to help reduce sampling error. pMRI is also valuable for after treatment to determine if the abnormal area is a remaining tumor or a scar tissue. For patients that are undergoing anti-angiogenesis cancer therapy, pMRI can give the doctors a better sense of efficacy of the treatment by monitoring tumor cerebral blood volume.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cha S | title = Perfusion MR imaging of brain tumors | journal = Topics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 279–289 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15627003 | doi = 10.1097/00002142-200410000-00002 | s2cid = 25773559 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

'''Functional MRI (fMRI)'''{{snd}} measures blood flow changes in active parts of the brain while the patient is performing tasks and provides specific locations of the brain that are responsible for certain functions. Before performing a brain tumor surgery on patients, neurosurgeons would use fMRI to avoid damage to structures of the brain that correspond with important brain functions while resecting the tumor at the same time. Preoperative fMRI is important because it is often difficult to distinguish the anatomy near the tumor as it distorts its surrounding regions. Neurosurgeons would use fMRI to plan whether to perform a resection where tumor is surgically removed as much as possible, a biopsy where they take a surgical sampling amount to provide a diagnosis, or to not undergo surgery at all. For example, a neurosurgeon may be opposed to resecting a tumor near the motor cortex as that would affect the patient's movements. Without preoperative fMRI, the neurosurgeon would have to perform an awake-craniotomy where the patient would have to interact during open surgery to see if tumor removal would affect important brain functions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogomolny DL, Petrovich NM, Hou BL, Peck KK, Kim MJ, Holodny AI | title = Functional MRI in the brain tumor patient | journal = Topics in Magnetic Resonance Imaging | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 325–335 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15627006 | doi = 10.1097/00002142-200410000-00005 | s2cid = 45995537 }}</ref>

'''Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)'''{{snd}} a form of MRI that measures random Brownian motion of water molecules along a magnetic field gradient. For brain tumor diagnosis, measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in brain tumors allow doctors to categorize tumor type. Most brain tumors have higher ADC than normal brain tissues and doctors can match the observed ADC of the patient's brain tumor with a list of accepted ADC to identify tumor type. DWI is also useful for treatment and therapy purposes where changes in diffusion can be analyzed in response to drug, radiation, or gene therapy. Successful response results in apoptosis and increase in diffusion while failed treatment results in unchanged diffusion values.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maier SE, Sun Y, Mulkern RV | title = Diffusion imaging of brain tumors | journal = NMR in Biomedicine | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 849–864 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20886568 | pmc = 3000221 | doi = 10.1002/nbm.1544 }}</ref>

==== Other Types of Imaging Techniques ====
'''Computed Tomography (CT) Scan'''{{snd}} uses x-rays to take pictures from different angles and computer processing to combine the pictures into a 3D image. A CT scan usually serves as an alternative to MRI in cases where the patient cannot have an MRI due to claustrophobia or pacemaker. Compared to MRI, a CT scan shows a more detailed image of the bone structures near the tumor and can be used to measure the tumor's size.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |title=Tests for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/brain-spinal-cord-tumors-adults/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=cancer.org |language=en}}</ref> Like an MRI, a contrast dye may also be injected into the veins or ingested by mouth before a CT scan to better outline any tumors that may be present. CT scans use contrast materials that are iodine-based and barium sulfate compounds. The downside of using CT scans as opposed to MRI is that some brain tumors do not show up well on CT scans because some intra-axial masses are faint and resemble normal brain tissue. In some scenarios, brain tumors in CT scans may be mistaken for infarction, infection, and demyelination. To suspect that an intra-axial mass is a brain tumor instead of other possibilities, there must be unexplained calcifications in the brain, preservation of the cortex, and disproportionate mass effect.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Recognizing intra-axial tumors on brain computed tomography (CT) {{!}} Medmastery |url=https://public-nuxt.frontend.prod.medmastery.io/guides/brain-ct-clinical-guide/recognizing-intra-axial-tumors-brain-computed-tomography-ct-and |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=public-nuxt.frontend.prod.medmastery.io |language=en}}</ref>

'''CT Angiography (CTA)'''{{snd}} provides information about the blood vessels in the brain using X-rays. A contrast agent is always required to be injected into the patient in the CT scanner. CTA serves as an alternative to MRA.

'''Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan'''{{snd}} uses radioactive substances, with the most common one being a sugar known as FDG, while more specific tracers for glioma are emerging.<ref>{{cite journal

 }}</ref> This injected substance is taken up by cells that are actively dividing. Tumor cells are more active in dividing so they would absorb more of the radioactive substance. After injection, a scanner would be used to create an image of the radioactive areas in the brain. PET scans are used more often for high-grade tumors than for low-grade tumors. It is useful after treatment to help doctors determine if the abnormal area on an MRI image is a remaining tumor or a scar tissue. Scar tissues will not show up on PET scans while tumors would.<ref name=":8" />

However, these techniques cannot alone diagnose high- versus low-grade gliomas, and thus the definitive [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of brain tumor should only be confirmed by [[histology|histological examination]] of [[tumor]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]] samples obtained either by means of brain [[biopsy]] or open [[surgery]]. The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct [[prognosis]]. This examination, performed by a [[pathologist]], typically has three stages: interoperative examination of fresh tissue, preliminary microscopic examination of prepared tissues, and follow-up examination of prepared tissues after immunohistochemical staining or genetic analysis.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Pathology===
[[File:Oligodendroglioma1 high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of an [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer. Brain [[biopsy]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
Tumors have characteristics that allow the determination of malignancy and how they will evolve, and determining these characteristics will allow the medical team to determine the management plan.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[Anaplasia]] or dedifferentiation: loss of differentiation of cells and of their orientation to one another and blood vessels, a characteristic of anaplastic tumor tissue. Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nucleus of anaplastic cells is usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

[[Atypia]]: an indication of abnormality of a cell (which may be indicative of malignancy). Significance of the abnormality is highly dependent on context.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Watson AN |date=2007-01-01 |title=Significance of "Atypia" Found on Needle Biopsy of the Breast: Correlation with Surgical Outcome |url=https://elischolar.library.yale.edu/ymtdl/384 |journal=Yale Medicine Thesis Digital Library}}</ref>

[[Neoplasia]]: the (uncontrolled) division of cells. As such, neoplasia is not problematic but its consequences are: the uncontrolled division of cells means that the mass of a neoplasm increases in size, and in a confined space such as the intracranial cavity this quickly becomes problematic because the mass invades the space of the brain pushing it aside, leading to compression of the brain tissue and increased intracranial pressure and destruction of [[Parenchyma|brain parenchyma]]. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be attributable to the direct mass effect of the tumor, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, which may, in turn, have secondary symptoms.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[Necrosis]]: the (premature) death of cells, caused by external factors such as infection, toxin or trauma. Necrotic cells send the wrong chemical signals which prevent [[phagocyte]]s from disposing of the dead cells, leading to a buildup of dead tissue, cell debris and toxins at or near the site of the necrotic cells<ref name=necrs>{{MedlinePlus|002266|Necrosis}}</ref>

===Classification===
Tumors can be [[benign]] or [[malignant]], can occur in different parts of the brain, and may be classified as primary or secondary. A primary tumor is one that has started in the brain, as opposed to a [[metastasis|metastatic]] tumor, which is one that has spread to the brain from another area of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|title=What you need to know about brain tumors|publisher=National Cancer Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127124137/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wyntk/brain/page1|archive-date=27 January 2012|url-status=live|access-date=25 February 2012}}</ref> The incidence of metastatic tumors is approximately four times greater than primary tumors.<ref name=Mer2012/> Tumors may or may not be [[symptomatic]]: some tumors are discovered because the patient has symptoms, others show up incidentally on an imaging scan, or at an autopsy.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[Grading of the tumors of the central nervous system]] commonly occurs on a 4-point scale (I-IV) created by the World Health Organization in 1993. Grade I tumors are the least severe and commonly associated with long-term survival, with severity and prognosis worsening as the grade increases. Low-grade tumors are often benign, while higher grades are aggressively malignant and/or metastatic. Other grading scales do exist, many based upon the same criteria as the WHO scale and graded from I-IV.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta A, Dwivedi T | title = A Simplified Overview of World Health Organization Classification Update of Central Nervous System Tumors 2016 | journal = Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 629–641 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29204027 | pmc = 5709890 | doi = 10.4103/jnrp.jnrp_168_17 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Secondary====
Secondary tumors of the brain are [[metastasis|metastatic]] and have invaded the brain from [[cancer]]s originating in other organs. This means that a cancerous neoplasm has developed in another organ elsewhere in the body and that cancer cells have leaked from that primary tumor and then entered the [[lymphatic system]] and [[blood vessels]].  They then circulate through the bloodstream, and are deposited in the brain. There, these cells continue growing and dividing, becoming another invasive neoplasm of primary cancer's tissue. Secondary tumors of the brain are very common in the terminal phases of patients with an incurable metastasized cancer; the most common types of cancers that bring about secondary tumors of the brain are [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], malignant [[melanoma]], [[kidney cancer]], and [[colon cancer]] (in decreasing order of frequency).{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Secondary brain tumors are more common than primary ones; in the United States, there are about 170,000 new cases every year. Secondary brain tumors are the most common cause of tumors in the intracranial cavity. The [[human skull|skull]] bone structure can also be subject to a neoplasm that by its very nature reduces the volume of the intracranial cavity, and can damage the brain.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000769|Metastatic brain tumor}}</ref>

=====By behavior=====
Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be [[cancerous]] (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). However, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differ from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body.
In cancers elsewhere in the body, three malignant properties differentiate benign tumors from malignant forms of cancer: benign tumors are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Characteristics of malignant tumors include:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Louis DN, Perry A, Wesseling P, Brat DJ, Cree IA, Figarella-Branger D, Hawkins C, Ng HK, Pfister SM, Reifenberger G, Soffietti R, von Deimling A, Ellison DW | title = The 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: a summary | journal = Neuro-Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1231–1251 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34185076 | pmc = 8328013 | doi = 10.1093/neuonc/noab106 }}</ref>
* uncontrolled mitosis (growth by division beyond the normal limits)
* [[anaplasia]]: the cells in the neoplasm have an obviously different form (in size and shape). Anaplastic cells display marked [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphism]]. The [[cell nuclei]] are characteristically extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and enlarged; the nucleus might have the same size as the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell (nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1, instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6 ratio). [[Giant cells]] – considerably larger than their neighbors – may form and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei ([[syncytium|syncytia]]). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape.
* invasion or infiltration (medical literature uses these terms as synonymous equivalents. However, for clarity, the articles that follow adhere to a convention that they mean slightly different things; this convention is not followed outside these articles):
** Invasion or invasiveness is the spatial expansion of the tumor through uncontrolled mitosis, in the sense that the neoplasm invades the space occupied by adjacent tissue, thereby pushing the other tissue aside and eventually compressing the tissue. Often these tumors are associated with clearly outlined tumors in imaging.
** Infiltration is the behavior of the tumor either to grow (microscopic) tentacles that push into the surrounding tissue (often making the outline of the tumor undefined or diffuse) or to have tumor cells "seeded" into the tissue beyond the circumference of the tumorous mass; this does not mean that an infiltrative tumor does not take up space or does not compress the surrounding tissue as it grows, but an infiltrating neoplasm makes it difficult to say where the tumor ends and the healthy tissue starts.
* [[metastasis]] (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood).

Of the above malignant characteristics, some elements do not apply to primary neoplasms of the brain:
* Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize to other organs; some forms of primary brain tumors can metastasize but will not spread outside the intracranial cavity or the central spinal canal. Due to the BBB, cancerous cells of a primary neoplasm cannot enter the bloodstream and get carried to another location in the body. (Occasional isolated case reports suggest spread of certain brain tumors outside the central nervous system, e.g. bone metastasis of [[glioblastoma]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frappaz D, Mornex F, Saint-Pierre G, Ranchere-Vince D, Jouvet A, Chassagne-Clement C, Thiesse P, Mere P, Deruty R | title = Bone metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme confirmed by fine needle biopsy | journal = Acta Neurochirurgica | volume = 141 | issue = 5 | pages = 551–2 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10392217 | doi = 10.1007/s007010050342 | s2cid = 40327650 }}</ref>)
* Primary brain tumors generally are invasive (i.e. they will expand spatially and intrude into the space occupied by other brain tissue and compress those brain tissues); however, some of the more malignant primary brain tumors will infiltrate the surrounding tissue.

==== By genetics ====
In 2016, the WHO restructured their classifications of some categories of [[glioma]]s to include distinct [[genetic mutations]] that have been useful in differentiating tumor types, prognoses, and treatment responses. Genetic mutations are typically detected via [[immunohistochemistry]], a technique that visualizes the presence or absence of a targeted protein via [[staining]].<ref name=":4" />
* Mutations in [[IDH1]] and [[IDH2]] genes are commonly found in low-grade gliomas
* Loss of both IDH genes combined with loss of [[chromosome]] arms 1p and 19q indicates the tumor is an [[oligodendroglioma]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/oligodendroglioma/| title= Oligodendroglioma|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 21 August 2021}}</ref>
* Loss of [[P53|TP53]] and [[ATRX]] characterizes [[astrocytoma]]s
* Genes [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]], [[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]], and [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]], are commonly altered in gliomas and are useful in differentiating tumor grade and biology<ref name=":4" />

==Treatment==
A medical team generally assesses the treatment options and presents them to the person affected and their family. Various types of treatment are available depending on tumor type and location, and may be combined to produce the best chances of survival:<ref name="aans"/>
* Surgery:<ref name="aans"/> complete or partial [[Resection (surgery)|resection]] of the tumor with the objective of removing as many tumor cells as possible.
* Radiotherapy:<ref name="aans"/> the most commonly used treatment for brain tumors; the tumor is irradiated with beta, x rays or gamma rays.
* Chemotherapy:<ref name="aans"/> a treatment option for cancer, however, it is not always used to treat brain tumors as the blood–brain barrier can prevent some drugs from reaching the cancerous cells.
* A variety of experimental therapies are available through clinical trials.

Survival rates in primary brain tumors depend on the type of tumor, age, functional status of the patient, the extent of surgical removal and other factors specific to each case.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nicolato A, Gerosa MA, Fina P, Iuzzolino P, Giorgiutti F, Bricolo A | title = Prognostic factors in low-grade supratentorial astrocytomas: a uni-multivariate statistical analysis in 76 surgically treated adult patients | journal = Surgical Neurology | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–21; discussion 221–3 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8545771 | doi = 10.1016/0090-3019(95)00184-0 }}</ref>

===Surgery===
The primary and most desired course of action described in medical literature is surgical removal (resection) via [[craniotomy]].<ref name="aans"/> Minimally invasive techniques are becoming the dominant trend in neurosurgical oncology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spetzler RF, Sanai N | title = The quiet revolution: retractorless surgery for complex vascular and skull base lesions | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–300 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21981642 | doi = 10.3171/2011.8.JNS101896 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The main objective of surgery is to remove as many tumor cells as possible, with complete removal being the best outcome and [[cytoreduction]] ("debulking") of the tumor otherwise.

Many [[meningiomas]], with the exception of some tumors located at the skull base, can be successfully removed surgically.
Most [[pituitary adenoma]]s can be removed surgically, often using a minimally invasive approach through the [[nasal cavity]] and skull base (trans-nasal, trans-sphenoidal approach). Large [[pituitary adenoma]]s require a [[craniotomy]] (opening of the skull) for their removal. Radiotherapy, including [[stereotactic]] approaches, is reserved for inoperable cases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gheorghiu ML, Fleseriu M | title = Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Pituitary Adenomas, is it Better than Conventional Radiation Therapy? | journal = Acta Endocrinologica | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–490 | date = 2017 | pmid = 31149219 | pmc = 6516550 | doi = 10.4183/aeb.2017.476 }}</ref>

Multiple metastatic tumors are generally treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy rather than surgery and the prognosis in such cases is determined by the primary tumor, and is generally poor.

===Radiation therapy===
The goal of radiation therapy is to kill tumor cells while leaving normal brain tissue unharmed. In standard [[external beam radiation therapy]], multiple treatments of standard-dose "fractions" of radiation are applied to the brain. This process is repeated for a total of 10 to 30 treatments, depending on the type of tumor. This additional treatment provides some patients with improved outcomes and longer survival rates.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[Radiosurgery]] is a treatment method that uses computerized calculations to focus radiation at the site of the tumor while minimizing the radiation dose to the surrounding brain. Radiosurgery may be an adjunct to other treatments, or it may represent the primary treatment technique for some tumors. Forms used include [[stereotactic]] radiosurgery, such as [[Gamma knife]], [[Cyberknife (device)|Cyberknife]] or [[Novalis radiosurgery|Novalis Tx]] [[radiosurgery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |title=Radiosurgery treatment comparisons – Cyberknife, Gamma knife, Novalis Tx |access-date=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520230154/http://www.sdcyberknife.com/comparison.htm |archive-date=20 May 2007  }}</ref>{{medrs|date=July 2014}}

[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is the most common treatment for secondary brain tumors. The amount of radiotherapy depends on the size of the area of the brain affected by cancer. Conventional external beam "whole-brain radiotherapy treatment" (WBRT) or "whole-brain irradiation" may be suggested if there is a risk that other secondary tumors will develop in the future.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Cancer Research UK |url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=5301 |title=Treating secondary brain tumours with WBRT |access-date=5 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025211917/http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=5301 |archive-date=25 October 2007  }}</ref> Stereotactic radiotherapy is usually recommended in cases involving fewer than three small secondary brain tumors. Radiotherapy may be used following, or in some cases in place of, resection of the tumor. Forms of radiotherapy used for brain cancer include [[external beam radiation therapy]], the most common, and [[brachytherapy]] and [[proton therapy]], the last especially used for children.

People who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors have more than twice the risk of developing learning and memory problems than those treated with SRS alone.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=MD Anderson Cancer Center |url=http://www.mdanderson.org/diseases/braincancer/display.cfm?id=8f11775f-75bb-4d7b-b3ac46878a1d56d0&method=displayfull&pn=00c8a30f-c468-11d4-80fb00508b603a14 |title=Whole Brain Radiation increases risk of learning and memory problems in cancer patients with brain metastases |access-date=5 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005220401/http://www.mdanderson.org/diseases/braincancer/display.cfm?id=8f11775f-75bb-4d7b-b3ac46878a1d56d0&method=displayfull&pn=00c8a30f-c468-11d4-80fb00508b603a14 |archive-date=5 October 2008  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=International RadioSurgery Association |url=http://www.irsa.org/metastatic_tumors.html |title=Metastatic brain tumors |access-date=5 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616155755/http://www.irsa.org/metastatic_tumors.html |archive-date=16 June 2012 }}</ref> Results of a 2021 systematic review found that when using SRS as the initial treatment, survival or death related to brain metastasis was not greater than alone versus SRS with WBRT.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Garsa A, Jang JK, Baxi S, Chen C, Akinniranye O, Hall O, Larkin J, Motala A, Newberry S, Hempel S | title = Radiation Therapy for Brain Metasases | date = 2021-06-09 | pmid = 34152714 | doi = 10.23970/ahrqepccer242 | s2cid = 236256085 }}</ref>

Postoperative conventional daily radiotherapy improves survival for adults with good functional well-being and high grade glioma compared to no postoperative radiotherapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy has similar efficacy for survival as compared to conventional radiotherapy, particularly for individuals aged 60 and older with [[glioblastoma]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan L, Soliman H, Sahgal A, Perry J, Xu W, Tsao MN | title = External beam radiation dose escalation for high grade glioma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = CD011475 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32437039 | pmc = 7389526 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011475.pub3 }}</ref>

===Chemotherapy===
Patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] are administered drugs designed to kill [[tumor]] cells.<ref name="aans"/> Although chemotherapy may improve overall survival in patients with the most malignant primary brain tumors, it does so in only about 20 percent of patients. Chemotherapy is often used in young children instead of radiation, as radiation may have negative effects on the developing brain. The decision to prescribe this treatment is based on a patient's overall health, type of tumor, and extent of cancer. The toxicity and many side effects of the drugs, and the uncertain outcome of chemotherapy in brain tumors puts this treatment further down the line of treatment options with surgery and radiation therapy preferred.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perkins A, Liu G | title = Primary Brain Tumors in Adults: Diagnosis and Treatment | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–217 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26926614 }}</ref>

UCLA Neuro-Oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. They are the only institution in the United States that displays how brain tumor patients are performing on current therapies. They also show a listing of chemotherapy agents used to treat high-grade glioma tumors.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=UCLA Neuro-Oncology Program |url=http://www.neurooncology.ucla.edu/Performance/GlioblastomaMultiforme.aspx |title=How Our Patients Perform: Glioblastoma Multiforme |access-date=5 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609070823/http://www.neurooncology.ucla.edu/Performance/GlioblastomaMultiforme.aspx |archive-date=9 June 2012  }}</ref>

Genetic mutations have significant effects on the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Gliomas with [[IDH1]] or [[IDH2]] mutations respond better to chemotherapy than those without the mutation. Loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q also indicate better response to chemoradiation.<ref name=":4" />

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of brain cancer depends on the type of cancer diagnosed. [[Medulloblastoma]] has a good prognosis with [[Medulloblastoma#Treatment and prognosis|chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection]] while glioblastoma has a median survival of only 15 months even with aggressive [[chemoradiotherapy]] and surgery.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |title=Central Nervous System Tumours |collaboration=WHO Classification of Tumours Editorial Board |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |year=2021 |isbn=978-92-832-4508-7 |pages=39 ff |language=en}}</ref> Brainstem gliomas have the poorest prognosis of any form of brain cancer, with most patients dying within one year, even with therapy that typically consists of radiation to the tumor along with [[corticosteroid]]s. However, one type, focal brainstem gliomas in children, seems open to exceptional prognosis and long-term survival has frequently been reported.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childhoodbraintumor.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57:brain-stem-gliomas-in-childhood&catid=34:brain-tumor-types-and-imaging&Itemid=53 |title=Brain Stem Gliomas in Childhood |publisher=Childhoodbraintumor.org |access-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309100048/http://www.childhoodbraintumor.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57%3Abrain-stem-gliomas-in-childhood&catid=34%3Abrain-tumor-types-and-imaging&Itemid=53 |archive-date=9 March 2012  }}</ref>

Prognosis is also affected by presentation of genetic mutations. Certain mutations provide better prognosis than others. [[IDH1]] and [[IDH2]] mutations in [[glioma]]s, as well as deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, generally indicate better prognosis. [[P53|TP53]], [[ATRX]], [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]], [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]], and [[Telomerase reverse transcriptase|TERT]] mutations are also useful in determining prognosis.<ref name=":4" />

===Glioblastoma===
{{Main|Glioblastoma}}

[[Glioblastoma]] is the most aggressive ([[grading of the tumors of the central nervous system|grade 4]]) and most common form of a malignant primary brain tumor. Even when aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical excision is used, median survival is only 15–18 months.<ref name=":12" /> Standard therapy for glioblastoma consists of maximal surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]] of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy between two and four weeks after the [[craniotomy|surgical procedure]] to remove the cancer, then by [[temozolomide|chemotherapy]], such as [[temozolomide]].<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasmita AO, Wong YP, Ling AP | title = Biomarkers and therapeutic advances in glioblastoma multiforme | journal = Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–51 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28840962 | doi = 10.1111/ajco.12756 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Most patients with glioblastoma take a [[corticosteroid]], typically [[dexamethasone]], during their illness to relieve symptoms.

[[Oligodendroglioma]]s are incurable but slowly progressive malignant brain tumors. They can be treated with [[Segmental resection|surgical resection]], [[chemotherapy]], [[radiotherapy]] or a combination. For some suspected low-grade (grade II) tumors, only a course of watchful waiting and symptomatic therapy is opted for. These tumors show co-deletions of the p and q arms of [[chromosome 1 (human)|chromosome 1]] and [[chromosome 19 (human)|chromosome 19]] respectively (1p19q co-deletion) and have been found to be especially chemosensitive with one report claiming them to be one of the most chemosensitive tumors.<ref name=":12" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ty AU, See SJ, Rao JP, Khoo JB, Wong MC | title = Oligodendroglial tumor chemotherapy using "decreased-dose-intensity" PCV: a Singapore experience | journal = Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 247–9 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16434664 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000194211.68164.a0 | s2cid = 31170268 | url = http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/2/247 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720044323/http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/2/247 | archive-date = 20 July 2008 }}</ref> A median survival of up to 16.7 years has been reported for grade II oligodendrogliomas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neurology.org |title=Neurology |publisher=Neurology |access-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219094513/http://www.neurology.org/ |archive-date=19 February 2012  }}</ref>

The incidence of low-grade astrocytoma has not been shown to vary significantly with nationality. However, studies examining the incidence of malignant [[central nervous system]] (CNS) tumors have shown some variation with national origin. Since some high-grade lesions arise from low-grade tumors, these trends are worth mentioning. Specifically, the incidence of CNS tumors in the United States, Israel, and the Nordic countries is relatively high, while Japan and Asian countries have a lower incidence. These differences probably reflect some biological differences as well as differences in pathologic diagnosis and reporting.<ref name=gallo>{{cite web |vauthors=Jallo GI, Benardete EA |title=Low-Grade Astrocytoma |date=January 2010 |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1156429-overview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727113105/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1156429-overview |archive-date=27 July 2010  }}</ref>

Over 2018, it was projected that there would be 23,880 new cases of brain tumors and 16,830 deaths in 2018 as a result,<ref name=":5" /> accounting for 1.4 percent of all cancers and 2.8 percent of all cancer deaths.<ref name=r2>{{cite web |publisher=American Cancer Society |url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BrainCNSTumorsinAdults/DetailedGuide/brain-and-spinal-cord-tumors-in-adults-key-statistics |title=What are the key statistics about brain and spinal cord tumors? |date=1 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702042112/http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BrainCNSTumorsinAdults/DetailedGuide/brain-and-spinal-cord-tumors-in-adults-key-statistics |archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref> Median age of diagnosis was 58 years old, while median age of death was 65. Diagnosis was slightly more common in males, at approximately 7.5 cases per 100 000 people, while females saw 2 fewer at 5.4. Deaths as a result of brain cancer were 5.3 per 100 000 for males, and 3.6 per 100 000 for females, making brain cancer the 10th leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Overall lifetime risk of developing brain cancer is approximated at 0.6 percent for men and women.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html|title=2018 CBTRUS Fact Sheet|date=31 March 2019|website=Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States|access-date=14 February 2019|archive-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214061511/http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===UK===
Brain, other CNS or intracranial tumors are the ninth most common cancer in the UK (around 10,600 people were diagnosed in 2013), and it is the eighth most common cause of cancer death (around 5,200 people died in 2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Brain, other CNS and intracranial tumours statistics|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/brain/|website=Cancer Research UK|access-date=27 October 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016033148/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/brain/|archive-date=16 October 2014}}</ref> White British patients with brain tumour are 30% more likely to die within a year of diagnosis than patients from other ethnicities.

===Children===
In the United States more than 28,000 people under 20 are estimated to have a brain tumor.<ref name="Quick Brain Tumor Facts">{{Cite web|url=http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/brain-tumor-facts/|title=Quick Brain Tumor Facts|website=National Brain Tumor Society|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> About 3,720 new cases of brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in those under 15 in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html|title=CBTRUS – 2018 CBTRUS Fact Sheet|website=cbtrus.org|access-date=14 February 2019|archive-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214061511/http://www.cbtrus.org/factsheet/factsheet.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Higher rates were reported in 1985–1994 than in 1975–1983. There is some debate as to the reasons; one theory is that the trend is the result of improved diagnosis and reporting, since the jump occurred at the same time that [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRIs]] became available widely, and there was no coincident jump in [[Mortality rate|mortality]].
