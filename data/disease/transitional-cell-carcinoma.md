'''Transitional cell carcinoma''', also called '''urothelial carcinoma''', is a type of [[cancer]] that typically occurs in the [[urinary system]]. It is the most common type of [[bladder cancer]] and cancer of the [[ureter]], [[urethra]], and [[urachus]]. Symptoms of urothelial carcinoma in the bladder include hematuria (blood in the urine). Diagnosis includes urine analysis and imaging of the urinary tract ([[cystoscopy]]). Transitional cell carcinomas arise from the [[transitional epithelium]], a tissue lining the inner surface of these hollow organs.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000017251|transitional cell carcinoma}}</ref> When the term "urothelial" is used, it specifically refers to a carcinoma of the [[urothelium]], meaning a transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary system.

It accounts for 95% of [[bladder cancer]] cases and bladder cancer is in the top 10 most common malignancy disease in the world and is associated with approximately 200,000 deaths per year in the US.<ref name="AndreassenAagnes2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreassen BK, Aagnes B, Gislefoss R, Andreassen M, Wahlqvist R | title = Incidence and Survival of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder in Norway 1981-2014 | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 799 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27737647 | doi = 10.1186/s12885-016-2832-x | pmc = 5064906 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="CancerCenter">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cancercenter.com/bladder-cancer/types/|title=Types of Bladder Cancer: TCC & Other Variants|website=CancerCenter.com|access-date=2018-08-10}}</ref> It is the second most common type of [[kidney cancer]], but accounts for only five to 10 percent of all primary renal malignant tumors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/kidney-cancer/introduction|title=Kidney Cancer - Introduction|date=2012-06-25|publisher=Cancer.Net|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> Men and older people have a higher rate of urothelial carcinomas. Other risk factors include smoking and exposure to [[Aromatic amine|aromatic amines]].<ref name=":0" />

Treatment approaches depend on the stage and spread of the tumour. Tumour removal (resection), chemotherapy and chemoradiation may be indicated. [[Immunotherapy]] with [[Immune checkpoint inhibitor|immune check point inhibitor]] medications may also be suggested.<ref name=":0" />

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of transitional cell carcinomas depend on the location and extent of the cancer. Symptoms of bladder cancer is blood in the urine.<ref name=":0" />

==Causes==
Urothelial carcinoma is a prototypical example of a [[Malignancies|malignancy]] arising from environmental [[carcinogen]]ic influences. By far the most important cause is [[Smoking|cigarette smoking]], which contributes to approximately one-half of the [[disease burden]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Bladder Cancer Risk Factors {{!}} Risk for Bladder Cancer |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/bladder-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=www.cancer.org |language=en}}</ref> [[Chemical Exposure|Chemical exposure]], such as those sustained by workers in the [[petroleum industry]], the manufacture of paints and pigments (e.g., [[aniline]] dyes),<ref name=":0" /> and [[agrochemical]]s are known to predispose one to urothelial cancer.<ref name=":1" /> The risk is lowered by increased liquid consumption, presumably as a consequence of increased urine production and thus less dwell time on the urothelial surface. Conversely, risk is increased among long-haul truck drivers and others in whom long urine dwell-times are encountered. As with most [[epithelial cancers]], physical [[irritation]] has been associated with increased risk of [[malignant transformation]] of the urothelium. Thus, urothelial carcinomas are more common in the context of chronic [[Urinary stone|urinary stone disease]], chronic [[catheterization]] (as in patients with [[paraplegia]] or [[multiple sclerosis]]), and chronic [[infection]]s. Some particular examples are listed below:

==Growth and spread==
Transitional cell carcinomas are often multifocal, with 30–40% of patients having more than one [[tumor]] at diagnosis. The pattern of growth of transitional cell carcinomas can be papillary, [[sessility (medicine)|sessile]], or [[carcinoma in situ]]. The most common site of transitional cell carcinoma [[metastasis]] outside the [[pelvis]] is bone (35%); of these, 40 percent are in the [[Vertebral column|spine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Punyavoravut V, Nelson SD | title = Diffuse bony metastasis from transitional cell carcinoma of urinary bladder: a case report and review of literature | journal = Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet Thangphaet | volume = 82 | issue = 8 | pages = 839–843 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10511795 }}</ref>

===Classification===
Transitional cell carcinomas are mostly papillary (70%,<ref name="AndreassenAagnes2016"/> and 30% non-papillary).<ref name="AndreassenAagnes2016"/>

The 1973 [[WHO]] grading system for transitional cell carcinomas ([[papilloma]], G1, G2 or G3) is most commonly used despite being superseded by the 2004 WHO<ref>Sauter G, Algaba F, Amin MB, Busch C, Cheville J, Gasser T, Grignon D, Hofstaedter F, Lopez-Beltran A, Epstein JI. Noninvasive urothelial neoplasias: WHO classification of noninvasive papillary urothelial tumors. In [[World Health Organization]] classification of tumors. Pathology and genetics of tumors of the urinary system and male genital organs. Eble JN, Epstein JI, Sesterhenn I (eds): Lyon, IARCC Press, p. 110, 2004</ref> grading for papillary types (papillary [[neoplasm]] of low malignant potential [PNLMP], low grade, and high grade papillary carcinoma). High-grade carcinoma typically displays more pleomorphism, multiple mitoses, euchromatin and relatively prominent nucleoli, and uneven distribution of nuclei.

==Treatment==
===Localized/early transitional cell carcinomas of bladder===
Transitional cell carcinomas can be very difficult to treat. Treatment for localized stage transitional cell carcinomas is surgical resection of the tumor, but recurrence is common. Some patients are given [[mitomycin]] into the bladder either as a one-off dose in the immediate post-operative period (within 24 hrs) or a few weeks after the surgery as a six dose regimen.

Localized/early transitional cell carcinomas can also be treated with infusions of [[BCG as a treatment for bladder cancer|Bacille Calmette–Guérin]] into the bladder. These are given weekly for either 6 weeks (induction course) or 3 weeks (maintenance/booster dose). Side effects include a small chance of developing systemic [[tuberculosis]] or the patient becoming sensitized to BCG, causing severe intolerance and a possible reduction in bladder volume due to scarring.

In patients with evidence of early muscular invasion, radical curative surgery in the form of a cysto-prostatectomy usually with lymph node sampling can also be performed. In such patients, a bowel loop is often used to create either a "neo-bladder" or an "ileal conduit" which act as a place for the storage of urine before it is evacuated from the body either via the urethra or a urostomy respectively.

===Advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinomas===
First-line [[chemotherapy]] regimens for advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinomas consists of [[gemcitabine]] and [[cisplatin]]) or a combination of [[methotrexate]], [[vinblastine]], [[adriamycin]], and [[cisplatin]] (MVAC polychemotherapy).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = von der Maase H, Hansen SW, Roberts JT, Dogliotti L, Oliver T, Moore MJ, Bodrogi I, Albers P, Knuth A, Lippert CM, Kerbrat P, Sanchez Rovira P, Wersall P, Cleall SP, Roychowdhury DF, Tomlin I, Visseren-Grul CM, Conte PF | display-authors = 6 | title = Gemcitabine and cisplatin versus methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in advanced or metastatic bladder cancer: results of a large, randomized, multinational, multicenter, phase III study | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 18 | issue = 17 | pages = 3068–3077 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11001674 | doi = 10.1200/jco.2000.18.17.3068 | s2cid = 21471159 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The side effects associated with some of these polychemotherapy treatment options are considered serious and mortality from MVAC treatment has been estimated at approximately 4%.<ref name=":0" /> Cisplatin and gemcitabine treatment may be associated with less severe side effects.<ref name=":0" /> Up to half of people with bladder cancer are not able to take these chemotherapy treatments due to their overall health.

Taxanes or [[vinflunine]] have been used as second-line therapy (after progression on a platinum containing chemotherapy).<ref>[http://www.oncnursingnews.com/web-exclusives/immunotherapy-proceeds-to-change-bladder-cancer-treatment ''Immunotherapy Proceeds to Change Bladder Cancer Treatment'' 2017]</ref>
