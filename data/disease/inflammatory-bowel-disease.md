==Signs and symptoms==
{{Symptoms in CD vs. UC}}
In spite of Crohn's and UC being very different diseases, both may present with any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]], [[rectal bleeding]], severe internal cramps/muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and [[weight loss]].

{{Findings in CD vs. UC}}

==Causes==
{{Pathophysiology in CD vs. UC}}
IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine.<ref name="pmid17499605" />

=== Diet ===

People living with IBD are very interested in diet, but little is known about the impact of diet on these patients. Recent reviews underlined the important role of nutritional counselling in IBD patients. Patients should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation.<ref name="Ananthakrishnan-2022">Ananthakrishnan AN, Kaplan GG, Bernstein CN, Burke KE, Lochhead PJ, Sasson AN, Agrawal M, Tiong JHT, Steinberg J, Kruis W, Steinwurz F, Ahuja V, Ng SC, Rubin DT, Colombel JF, Gearry R; International Organization for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

A 2022 study found that diets with increased intake of fruits and vegetables, reduction of processed meats and refined carbohydrates, and preference of water for hydration were associated with lower risk of active symptoms with IBD, although increased intake of fruits and vegetables alone did not reduce risk of symptoms with Crohn's disease.<ref name="pmid35092268">{{Cite journal|last1=Limketkai|first1=Berkeley N.|last2=Hamideh|first2=Mohamed|last3=Shah|first3=Rishabh|last4=Sauk|first4=Jenny S.|last5=Jaffe|first5=Nancee|date=2022-01-29|title=Dietary Patterns and Their Association With Symptoms Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|journal=Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=1627–1636|doi=10.1093/ibd/izab335|issn=1536-4844|pmid=35092268|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Dietary patterns are associated with a risk for ulcerative colitis. In particular, subjects who were in the highest [[tertile]] of the [[healthy dietary pattern]] had a 79% lower risk of ulcerative colitis.<ref name="pmid29468761">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rashvand S, Behrooz M, Samsamikor M, Jacobson K, Hekmatdoost A | title = Dietary patterns and risk of ulcerative colitis: a case-control study | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 408–412 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29468761 | doi = 10.1111/jhn.12544 | s2cid = 3452004 }}</ref>

[[Gluten sensitivity]] is common in IBD and associated with having flareups.

The activation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species leads to oxidative stress for both host cells and the gut microbiome. Consequently, in IBD, there is a microbial imbalance, known as dysbiosis, characterized by an increase in functional pathways involved in the microbial response to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress can promote the growth of certain species such as R. gnavus.<ref>{{cite journal |title=clade enriched in inflammatory bowel disease patients |date=2017 |pmid=29183332 |last1=Hall |first1=A.

===Medical therapies===
Medical treatment of IBD is individualised to each patient.<ref name="pmid21464096" /> The choice of which drugs to use and by which route to administer them (oral, rectal, injection, infusion) depends on factors including the type, distribution, and severity of the patient's disease, as well as other historical and biochemical prognostic factors, and patient preferences. For example, [[mesalazine]] is more useful in [[ulcerative colitis]] than in [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=agabegi2nd/> Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require [[immunosuppression]] to control the symptoms, with drugs such as [[prednisone]], [[TNF inhibitor|tumor necrosis factor inhibitor]]s (TNF inhibitors), [[azathioprine]], [[methotrexate]], or [[6-mercaptopurine]].<ref name="pmid22573191">{{Cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Benjamin L. |last2=Torres |first2=Joana |last3=déric Colombel |first3=Jean-Fré |date=2012 |title=Immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease: how much is too much? |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=341–348 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e328354567f |issn=0267-1379 |pmc=6681654 |pmid=22573191}}</ref>

[[Glucocorticoid|Steroid]]s, such as the glucocorticoid [[prednisone]], are frequently used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug.

Treatment is usually started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone. Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, another drug to keep the disease in remission, such as [[mesalazine]] in UC, is the main treatment. If further treatment is required, a combination of an immunosuppressive drug (such as azathioprine) with mesalazine (which may also have an anti-inflammatory effect) may be needed, depending on the patient. Controlled release [[budesonide]] is used for mild ileal Crohn's disease.<ref name="pmid21464096" />

Nutritional deficiencies play a prominent role in IBD. Malabsorption, diarrhea, and GI blood loss are common features of IBD. Deficiencies of B vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids, and key minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and [[Selenium in biology|selenium]] are extremely common and benefit from replacement therapy. Dietary interventions, including certain exclusion diets like the [[specific carbohydrate diet]] (SCD) can be beneficial for symptom management.<ref name="pmid25569442">{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlebois A, Rosenfeld G, Bressler B | title = The Impact of Dietary Interventions on the Symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 1370–8 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 25569442 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2012.760515 | s2cid = 267557 }}</ref> Dietary fiber interventions, such as psyillium supplementation (a mixture of soluble and insoluble fibers), may relieve symptoms as well as induce/maintain remission by altering the microbiome composition of the GI tract, thereby improving regulation of immune function, reducing inflammation, and helping to restore the intestinal mucosal lining.<ref name="pmid27314323">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong C, Harris PJ, Ferguson LR | title = Potential Benefits of Dietary Fibre Intervention in Inflammatory Bowel Disease | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | date = June 2016 | page = 919 | pmid = 27314323 | pmc = 4926452 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17060919 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Anaemia]] is commonly present in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Due to raised levels of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s which lead to the increased expression of [[hepcidin]], [[parenteral iron]] is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system, has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment. Hepcidin itself is also an anti-inflammatory agent.

Gastrointestinal bleeding, occurring especially during ulcerative colitis relapse, can contribute to anaemia when chronic, and may be life-threatening when acute.

The goal of treatment is toward achieving remission, after which the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer potential side effects. Every so often, an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear; this is known as a "flare-up". Depending on the circumstances, it may go away on its own or require medication.

In 2005 ''[[New Scientist]]'' published a joint study by [[Bristol University]] and the [[University of Bath]] on the apparent healing power of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on IBD. Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of [[cannabinoid receptor]]s in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals. [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB1 cannabinoid receptors]] – which are known to be present in the [[brain]] – exist in the [[endothelial cells]] which line the gut, it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged.<ref name="pmid16083701">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright K, Rooney N, Feeney M, Tate J, Robertson D, [[Melanie Welham|Welham M]], Ward S | title = Differential expression of cannabinoid receptors in the human colon: cannabinoids promote epithelial wound healing | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 437–53 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16083701 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.05.026 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced [[cannabinoid]]s; the result was that gut started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears. It is believed that in a healthy gut, natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endothelial cells when they are injured, which then bind to the CB1 receptors. The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction, and when people use cannabis, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way.<ref name="pmid16083701"/>

Previous studies have shown that CB1 receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut [[motility]], therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea. [[Cannabinoid receptor type 2|CB2]], another cannabinoid receptor predominantly expressed by [[White blood cell|immune cells]], was detected in the gut of people with IBD at a higher concentration. These receptors, which also respond to chemicals in cannabis, appear to be associated with [[apoptosis]] – programmed cell death – and may have a role in suppressing the overactive [[immune system]] and reducing [[inflammation]] by mopping up excess [[Cell (biology)|cells]].<ref name="pmid16083701"/>

==In other species==
IBD also occurs in dogs and is thought to arise from a combination of host genetics, intestinal microenvironment, environmental components and the immune system. There is an ongoing discussion, however, that the term "chronic enteropathy" might be better to use than "inflammatory bowel disease" in dogs because it differs from IBD in humans in how the dogs respond to treatment. For example, many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD, who often need [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] treatment. Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation is occurring (lymphoplasmacytic, [[eosinophilic]], or [[granulomatous]]). In dogs, low levels of [[cobalamin]] in the blood have been shown to be a risk factor for negative outcome.<ref name="pmid27747868">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dandrieux JR | title = Inflammatory bowel disease versus chronic enteropathy in dogs: are they one and the same? | journal = The Journal of Small Animal Practice | volume = 57 | issue = 11 | pages = 589–599 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27747868 | doi = 10.1111/jsap.12588 | hdl = 11343/291847 | s2cid = 45207412 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid17708389">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allenspach K, Wieland B, Gröne A, Gaschen F | title = Chronic enteropathies in dogs: evaluation of risk factors for negative outcome | journal = [[Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 700–8 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17708389 | doi = 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2007.tb03011.x | doi-access = free | url = https://rvc-repository.worktribe.com/preview/1659487/kura-et-al-2023-can-mass-drug-administration-of-moxidectin-accelerate-onchocerciasis-elimination-in-africa.pdf | access-date = 2024-02-19 | archive-date = 2024-01-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240118040330/https://rvc-repository.worktribe.com/preview/1659487/kura-et-al-2023-can-mass-drug-administration-of-moxidectin-accelerate-onchocerciasis-elimination-in-africa.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="pmid21486642">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson KW, Jergens AE | title = Pitfalls and progress in the diagnosis and management of canine inflammatory bowel disease | journal = The Veterinary Clinics of North America.
