Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement can rarely occur with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

==Cause==
CLL can also be caused by a number of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic changes]], which are adaptations that add a tag to specific DNA sequences, rather than altering the sequence itself. In CLL, these changes can be classified into the addition of three different methyl subgroups (naïve B-cell-like, memory B-cell-like, and intermediate), which impact how much that DNA sequence is transcribed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarošová M, Plevová K, Kotašková J, Doubek M, Pospíšilová Š | title = The importance of complex karyotype in prognostication and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): a comprehensive review of the literature | journal = Leukemia & Lymphoma | volume = 60 | issue = 10 | pages = 2348–2355 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 30773964 | doi = 10.1080/10428194.2019.1576038 | s2cid = 73483725 }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011064243|title=WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues| vauthors = Swerdlow SH | publisher =  World Health Organization,, International Agency for Research on Cancer|year=2017|isbn=978-92-832-4494-3|edition=Revised 4th|location=Lyon|pages=219|oclc=1011064243}}</ref> Some relevant genetic mutations may be inherited.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a lymph node affected by B-CLL showing a characteristic proliferation center (right of image), composed of larger, lighter-staining, cells, [[H&E stain]]]]
The diagnosis of CLL is based on the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. CLL is usually first suspected by a diagnosis of [[lymphocytosis]], an increase in a type of white blood cell, on a [[complete blood count]] test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 5000 cells per microliter (μL) of blood but can be much higher.<ref name=Hall2017/> The presence of lymphocytosis in a person who is elderly should raise strong suspicion for CLL, and a confirmatory diagnostic test, in particular [[flow cytometry]], should be performed unless clinically unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/| title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 9 July 2021}}</ref>

=== Molecular examination of peripheral blood and flow cytometry ===
The combination of the microscopic examination of the peripheral blood and analysis of the lymphocytes by [[flow cytometry]] to confirm clonality and marker molecule expression is needed to establish the diagnosis of CLL. Both are easily accomplished on a small amount of blood. A [[flow cytometer]] instrument can examine the expression of molecules on individual cells in fluids. This requires the use of specific antibodies to marker molecules, with fluorescent tags recognized by the instrument.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In CLL, the lymphocytes are all genetically identical since they are derived from the same B cell lineage, expressing common B-cell markers CD19 and CD20, with abnormal expression of surface markers CD5 and CD23.<ref name="Strati2018" /> These B cells resemble normal lymphocytes under the microscope, although slightly smaller, and are fragile when smeared onto a glass slide, giving rise to many broken cells, which are called "smudge" or "smear" cells and can indicate the presence of the disease.<ref name="isbn1-4051-4265-0">{{cite book|author=Bain, Barbara J.|url=https://archive.org/details/bloodcellspracti00bain|title=Blood Cells: A Practical Guide|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-4265-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/bloodcellspracti00bain/page/n449 439]|url-access=limited}}</ref> Smudge cells are due to cancer cells lacking in [[vimentin]], a type of [[cytoskeleton]] proteins which is a structural component in a cell which maintains the cell's internal shape and mechanical resilience).<ref name="Wintrobe">{{cite book|title=Wintrobe's clinical hematology|date=2014|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-1451172683|editor1-last=Greer|editor1-first=John P.|edition=Thirteenth|editor2-last=Arber|editor2-first=Daniel A.|editor3-last=Glader|editor3-first=Bertil|editor4-last=List|editor4-first=Alan F.|editor5-last=Means Jr.|editor5-first=Robert T.|editor6-last=Paraskevas|editor6-first=Frixos|editor7-last=Rodgers|editor7-first=George M.|editor8-last=Foerster|editor8-first=John|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>{{rp|1899}}<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Patteson AE, Carroll RJ, Iwamoto DV, Janmey PA|date=December 2020|title=The vimentin cytoskeleton: when polymer physics meets cell biology|journal=Physical Biology|volume=18|issue=1|pages=011001|doi=10.1088/1478-3975/abbcc2 |pmc=8240483 |pmid=32992303}}</ref>[[File:Smear cells.jpg|thumb|right|Smudge cells in peripheral blood]]

=== Surface markers ===
The atypical molecular pattern on the surface of the cell includes the coexpression of cell surface markers [[cluster of differentiation|clusters of differentiation]] [[CD5 (protein)|5]] (CD5) and [[CD23|23]]. In addition, all the CLL cells within one individual are [[clonal selection|clonal]], that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive [[Immunoglobulin light chain|antibody light chains]], kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody-producing cells, resulting in a mixture of both kappa- and lambda-expressing cells. The lack of the normal distribution of these B cells is one basis for demonstrating [[clonality]], the key element for establishing a diagnosis of any B cell malignancy (B cell [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]).<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27169754/ | pmid=27169754 | year=2016 | last1=Roepman | first1=P. | last2=Boots | first2=C.

===Clinical staging===

Staging, determining the extent of the disease, is done with the Rai staging system or the Binet classification (see details<ref name="NCI2017Pt" />) and is based primarily on the presence of a low platelet or red cell count.

All the B cell malignancies of the blood and bone marrow can be differentiated from one another by the combination of cellular microscopic morphology, marker molecule expression, and specific tumor-associated gene defects. This is best accomplished by evaluation of the patient's blood, bone marrow, and occasionally lymph node cells by a [[pathologist]] with specific training in blood disorders. A flow cytometer is necessary for cell marker analysis, and the detection of genetic problems in the cells may require visualizing the DNA changes with fluorescent probes by [[fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Langer-Safer PR, Levine M, Ward DC | title = Immunological method for mapping genes on Drosophila polytene chromosomes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 79 | issue = 14 | pages = 4381–4385 | date = July 1982 | pmid = 6812046 | pmc = 346675 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.79.14.4381 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 1982PNAS...79.4381L }}</ref>

==Treatment==
CLL treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure. In those without or only minimal symptoms [[watchful waiting]] is generally appropriate.<ref name="NCI2017Pt" />

CLL is treated by [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[biological therapy]], or [[bone marrow transplantation]]. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically ([[splenectomy]] – removal of enlarged spleen) or by [[radiation therapy]] ("de-bulking" swollen lymph nodes).{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Initial CLL treatments vary depending on the exact diagnosis and the progression of the disease, and even with the preference and experience of the health care practitioner. Any of dozens of agents may be used for CLL therapy.<ref name="NCI2017Pt" />

===Decision to treat===
While it is generally considered incurable, CLL progresses slowly in most cases. Many people with CLL lead normal and active lives for many years—in some cases for decades. Because of its slow onset, asymptomatic early-stage CLL (Rai 0, Binet A) is, in general, not treated since it is believed that early-stage CLL intervention does not improve survival time or quality of life. Instead, the condition is monitored over time to detect any change in the disease pattern.<ref name="NCI2017Pt" /><ref name=CTO>{{cite journal |author=Janssens |title=Rituximab for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in Treatment-Naïve and Treatment-Experienced Patients |journal=Contemporary Oncology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=24–36 |year=2011 |url=http://www.onclive.com/publications/contemporary-oncology/2011/fall-2011/Rituximab-for-Chronic-Lymphocytic-Leukemia-in-Treatment-Nave-and-Treatment-Experienced-Patients|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallek M, Cheson BD, Catovsky D, Caligaris-Cappio F, Dighiero G, Döhner H, Hillmen P, Keating M, Montserrat E, Chiorazzi N, Stilgenbauer S, Rai KR, Byrd JC, Eichhorst B, O'Brien S, Robak T, Seymour JF, Kipps TJ | display-authors = 6 | title = iwCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL | journal = Blood | volume = 131 | issue = 25 | pages = 2745–2760 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29540348 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2017-09-806398 | s2cid = 206956090 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
