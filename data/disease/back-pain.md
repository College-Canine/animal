<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Back pain''' ([[Latin]]: ''dorsalgia'') is [[pain]] felt in the [[back]]. It may be classified as [[neck pain]] (cervical), [[middle back pain]] (thoracic), [[lower back pain]] (lumbar) or [[coccydynia]] (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected.<ref name="origin" /> The lumbar area is the most common area affected.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Church EJ, Odle TG | title = Diagnosis and treatment of back pain | journal = Radiologic Technology | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–151; quiz 152–155 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18032750 | doi = | url = https://adxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/articles/article_1.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210918183832/https://adxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/articles/article_1.pdf | archive-date = 18 September 2021 }}</ref> An episode of back pain may be [[Acute (medicine)|acute]], subacute or [[Chronic condition|chronic]] depending on the duration.

=== Nonspecific ===
In as many as 90 percent of cases, no physiological causes or abnormalities on diagnostic tests can be found.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Bosch MA, Hollingworth W, Kinmonth AL, Dixon AK | title = Evidence against the use of lumbar spine radiography for low back pain | journal = Clinical Radiology | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–76 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14697378 | doi = 10.1016/j.crad.2003.08.012 }}</ref> Nonspecific back pain can result from [[back strain]] or sprains, which can cause peripheral injury to muscle or ligaments. Many patients cannot identify the events or activities that may have caused the strain.<ref name=":4" /> The pain can present acutely but in some cases can persist, leading to chronic pain.

Chronic back pain in people with otherwise normal scans can result from [[central sensitization]], in which an initial injury causes a longer-lasting state of heightened sensitivity to pain. This persistent state maintains pain even after the initial injury has healed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolf CJ | title = Central sensitization: implications for the diagnosis and treatment of pain | journal = Pain | volume = 152 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S2–15 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 20961685 | pmc = 3268359 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2010.09.030 }}</ref> Treatment of sensitization may involve low doses of [[antidepressant]]s and directed rehabilitation such as [[physical therapy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verdu B, Decosterd I, Buclin T, Stiefel F, Berney A | title = Antidepressants for the treatment of chronic pain |url=http://chroniccare.rehab.washington.edu/resources/documents/antidepressantsinpain.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809084235/http://chroniccare.rehab.washington.edu/resources/documents/antidepressantsinpain.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2017 | journal = Drugs | volume = 68 | issue = 18 | pages = 2611–32 | date = 2008-01-01 | pmid = 19093703 | doi = 10.2165/0003495-200868180-00007 | s2cid = 10509699 }}</ref>

=== Spinal disc disease ===
Spinal disc disease occurs when the [[nucleus pulposus]], a gel-like material in the inner core of the vertebral disc, ruptures.<ref name=":11">{{Cite book|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine | vauthors = Jameson JL |isbn=978-1259644030|oclc=1041928452|date = 2018|page=| publisher = McGraw-Hill Education }}{{Page needed|date=February 2021}}</ref> Rupturing of the nucleus pulposus can lead to compression of nerve roots.<ref name=":18">{{cite book | vauthors = Donnally III CJ, Hanna A, Varacallo M | chapter = Lumbar Degenerative Disk Disease|date=2020| chapter-url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448134/|title = StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=28846354|access-date=2021-01-29 }}</ref> Symptoms may be unilateral or bilateral, and correlate to the region of the spine affected. The most common region for spinal disk disease is at L4–L5 or L5–S1.<ref name=":18" /> The risk for lumbar disc disease is increased in overweight individuals because of the increased compressive force on the nucleus pulposus, and is twice as likely to occur in men.<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{Cite book | work = National Center for Biotechnology Information |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279472/ |title= Slipped disc: Overview |location=Bethesda, MD|date=2020 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG)|language=en}}</ref> A 2002 study found that lifestyle factors such as night-shift work and lack of physical activity can also increase the risk of lumbar disc disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elfering A, Semmer N, Birkhofer D, Zanetti M, Hodler J, Boos N | title = Risk factors for lumbar disc degeneration: a 5-year prospective MRI study in asymptomatic individuals | language = en-US | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–134 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11805656 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200201150-00002 | s2cid = 30267765 }}</ref> [[File:Disc herniation -- Smart-Servier.png|thumb|Lumbar disc herniation]]

Severe spinal-cord compression is considered a surgical emergency and requires decompression to preserve motor and sensory function.

=== Degenerative disease ===
[[Spondylosis]], or degenerative arthritis of the spine, occurs when the intervertebral disc undergoes degenerative changes, causing the disc to fail at cushioning the vertebrae. There is an association between intervertebral disc space narrowing and lumbar spine pain.<ref name="Raa2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Raastad J, Reiman M, Coeytaux R, Ledbetter L, Goode AP | title = The association between lumbar spine radiographic features and low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 571–85 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25684125 | doi = 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2014.10.006 }}</ref> The space between the vertebrae becomes more narrow, resulting in compression and irritation of the nerves.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Lavelle WF, Kitab SA, Ramakrishnan R, Benzel EC | date = 2017 | chapter = Anatomy of Nerve Root Compression, Nerve Root Tethering, and Spinal Instability | title = Benzel's Spine Surgery | edition = 4th | pages = 200–205 | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Elsevier | isbn = 978-0-323-40030-5 }}</ref>

[[Spondylolisthesis|Spondylolithesis]] is the anterior shift of one vertebra compared to the neighboring vertebra. It is associated with age-related degenerative changes as well as trauma and congenital anomalies.

[[Spinal stenosis]] can occur in cases of severe spondylosis, spondylotheisis and age-associated thickening of the ligamentum flavum. Spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spinal canal and typically presents in patients greater than 60 years of age. [[Neurogenic claudication]] can occur in cases of severe lumbar spinal stenosis and presents with symptoms of pain in the lower back, buttock or leg that is worsened by standing and relieved by sitting.

[[Vertebral compression fracture]]s occur in four percent of patients presenting with lower back pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarvik JG, Deyo RA |url=https://jacobimed.org/public/Ambulatory_files/intern_ambulatory_block/spring/back%20pain%20imaging.pdf | title = Diagnostic evaluation of low back pain with emphasis on imaging | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 137 | issue = 7 | pages = 586–97 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12353946 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-137-7-200210010-00010 | s2cid = 860164 }}</ref> Risk factors include age, female gender, history of osteoporosis, and chronic [[glucocorticoid]] use. Fractures can occur as a result of trauma but in many cases can be asymptomatic.

=== Infection ===
Common infectious causes of back pain include [[osteomyelitis]], [[Discitis|septic discitis]], paraspinal abscess and [[epidural abscess]].<ref name=":11" /> Infectious causes that lead to back pain involve various structures surrounding the spine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=COVID and back pain - Omicron variant invades skeletal muscle cells |url=https://www.colcorona.net/covid-back-pain |access-date=2022-12-09 |website=www.colcorona.net}}</ref>

[[Osteomyelitis]] is the bacterial infection of the bone. [[Vertebral osteomyelitis]] is most commonly caused by [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]].<ref name=":11" /> Risk factors include skin infection, urinary tract infection, IV catheter use, IV drug use, previous endocarditis and lung disease.

[[Spinal epidural abscess]] is commonly caused by severe infection with [[Bloodstream infections|bacteremia]]. Risk factors include recent administration of epidurals, IV drug use or recent infection.

===Cancer===
Spread of cancer to the bone or spinal cord can lead to back pain. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastatic lesions. Patients typically have a history of malignancy. Common types of cancer that present with back pain include [[multiple myeloma]], [[lymphoma]], [[leukemia]], spinal cord tumors, primary vertebral tumors and [[prostate cancer]].<ref name=":16">{{Cite book|title=Symptom to diagnosis : an evidence-based guide| vauthors = Stern SD |isbn=978-0071803441|oclc=894996548|date = 2014 |edition=3|page=| publisher = McGraw-Hill Education }}{{page needed|date=February 2021}}</ref> Back pain is present in 29% of patients with systemic cancer.<ref name=":11" /> Unlike other causes of back pain that commonly affect the lumbar spine, the thoracic spine is most commonly affected.<ref name=":11" /> The pain can be associated with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, chills, fever, nausea and vomiting.<ref name=":11" /> Unlike other causes of back pain, [[neoplasm]]-associated back pain is constant, dull, poorly localized and worsens with rest. [[Metastasis]] to the bone also increases the risk of [[Spinal cord compression|spinal-cord compression]] or vertebral fractures that require emergency surgical treatment.

=== Autoimmune ===
[[File:Discogenic Pain.png|thumb|Back pain can be caused by the vertebrae compressing the intervertebral discs.]]
Inflammatory arthritides such as [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] can all cause varying levels of joint destruction. Among the inflammatory arthritides, ankylosing spondylitis is most closely associated with back pain because of the inflammatory destruction of the bony components of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis is common in young men and presents with a range of possible symptoms such as [[uveitis]], [[psoriasis]] and [[inflammatory bowel disease]].

=== Referred pain ===
Back pain can also be [[referred pain|referred]] from another source. Referred pain occurs when pain is felt at a location different than the source of the pain. Disease processes that can present with back pain include [[pancreatitis]], [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]], severe [[urinary tract infection]]s and [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s.<ref name=":4" />

===Risk factors===
Heavy lifting, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise can increase the risk of back pain.<ref name=":5" /> Cigarette smokers are more likely to experience back pain than are nonsmokers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shiri R, Karppinen J, Leino-Arjas P, Solovieva S, Viikari-Juntura E |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_sdt=0%2C5&q=+The+association+between+smoking+and+low+back+pain%3A+a+meta-analysis+&btnG= |format=PDF | title = The association between smoking and low back pain: a meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 123 | issue = 1 | pages = 87.e7–35 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20102998 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.05.028 }}</ref> Weight gain in pregnancy is also a risk factor for back pain. In general, fatigue can worsen pain.<ref name=":5" />

Back pain physical effects can range from muscle aching to a shooting, burning, or stabbing sensation.  Pain can radiate down the legs and can be increased by bending, twisting, lifting, standing, or walking. While the physical effects of back pain are always at the forefront, back pain also can have psychological effects. Back pain has been linked to depression, anxiety, stress, and avoidance behaviors due to mentally not being able to cope with the physical pain. Both acute and chronic back pain can be associated with psychological distress in the form of anxiety (worries, stress) or depression (sadness, discouragement). Psychological distress is a common reaction to the suffering aspects of acute back pain, even when symptoms are short-term and not medically serious.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = International Asscosiation for the Study of Pain (IASP) | date = 9 July 2021 | title = Psychology of Back Pain. | url = https://www.iasp-pain.org/resources/fact-sheets/psychology-of-back-pain/#:~:text=Both%20acute%20and%20chronic%20back,not%20medically%20serious%20%5B35%5D }}</ref>

Initial assessment of back pain consists of a history and physical examination.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=The color atlas and synopsis of family medicine| veditors = Usatine R, Smith MA, Mayeaux Jr EJ | vauthors = Chumley HS |isbn=978-1259862052|oclc=1080576440|date = 2019| publisher = McGraw Hill Professional }}</ref> Important characterizing features of back pain include location, duration, severity, history of prior back pain and possible trauma. Other important components of the patient history include age, physical trauma, prior history of cancer, fever, weight loss, urinary incontinence, progressive weakness or expanding sensory changes, which can indicate a medically urgent condition.<ref name=":12" />

Physical examination of the back should assess for posture and deformities. Pain elicited by palpating certain structures may be helpful in localizing the affected area. A neurologic exam is needed to assess for changes in [[gait]], sensation and motor function.

Determining if there are radicular symptoms, such as pain, numbness or weakness that radiate down limbs, is important for differentiating between central and peripheral causes of back pain. The [[Straight leg raise|straight leg test]] is a maneuver used to determine the presence of lumbosacral [[radiculopathy]], which occurs when there is irritation in the [[nerve root]] that causes neurologic symptoms such as numbness and tingling.

=== Imaging ===
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is the preferred modality for the evaluation of back pain and visualization of bone, soft tissue, nerves and ligaments. X-rays are a less costly initial option offered to patients with a low clinical suspicion of infection or malignancy, and they are combined with laboratory studies for interpretation.

Imaging is not warranted for most patients with acute back pain. Without signs and symptoms indicating a serious underlying condition, imaging does not improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Four to six weeks of treatment is appropriate before consideration of imaging studies. If a serious condition is suspected, MRI is usually most appropriate. Computed tomography is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable.<ref name="ReferenceA">Casazza BA. Diagnosis and treatment of acute low back pain.

== Prevention ==
Moderate-quality evidence exists that suggests that the combination of education and exercise may reduce an individual's risk of developing an episode of low back pain.<ref name="Steffens2016" /> Lesser-quality evidence points to exercise alone as a possible deterrent to the risk of the condition.<ref name="Steffens2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steffens D, Maher CG, Pereira LS, Stevens ML, Oliveira VC, Chapple M, Teixeira-Salmela LF, Hancock MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Prevention of Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 176 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–208 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26752509 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.7431 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Management==

=== Nonspecific pain ===
Patients with uncomplicated back pain should be encouraged to remain active and to return to normal activities.

The [[Pain management|management]] goals when treating back pain are to achieve maximal reduction in pain intensity as rapidly as possible, to restore the individual's ability to function in everyday activities, to help the patient cope with residual pain, to assess for side effects of therapy and to facilitate the patient's passage through the legal and socioeconomic impediments to recovery. For many, the goal is to keep the pain at a manageable level to progress with rehabilitation, which then can lead to long-term pain relief. Also, for some people the goal is to use nonsurgical therapies to manage the pain and avoid major surgery, while for others surgery may represent the quickest path to pain relief.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron R, Binder A, Attal N, Casale R, Dickenson AH, Treede RD | title = Neuropathic low back pain in clinical practice | journal = European Journal of Pain | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 861–73 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26935254 | pmc = 5069616 | doi = 10.1002/ejp.838 }}</ref>

Not all treatments work for all conditions or for all individuals with the same condition, and many must try several treatment options to determine what works best for them. The present stage of the condition (acute or chronic) is also a determining factor in the choice of treatment. Only a minority of people with back pain (most estimates are 1–10%) require surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/when-is-back-surgery-the-right-choice|title=When is back surgery the right choice? | publisher = Harvard Health Publishing |date=13 June 2014|access-date=2019-12-24}}</ref>

Surgery for back pain is typically used as a last resort, when serious neurological deficit is evident.<ref name=":2" /> A 2009 systematic review of back surgery studies found that, for certain diagnoses, surgery is moderately better than other common treatments, but the benefits of surgery often decline in the long term.<ref name="pmid19363455">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou R, Baisden J, Carragee EJ, Resnick DK, Shaffer WO, Loeser JD | title = Surgery for low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = Spine | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 1094–109 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19363455 | doi = 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181a105fc | s2cid = 1504909 }}</ref>

Surgery may sometimes be appropriate for people with severe [[myelopathy]] or [[cauda equina syndrome]].<ref name=":2" /> Causes of neurological deficits can include [[spinal disc herniation]], [[spinal stenosis]], [[degenerative disc disease]], [[Neoplasm|tumor]], infection, and spinal [[hematoma]]s, all of which can impinge on the nerve roots around the spinal cord.<ref name=":2" /> There are multiple surgical options to treat back pain, and these options vary depending on the cause of the pain.

When a herniated disc is compressing the nerve roots, hemi- or partial-[[laminectomy]] or [[discectomy]] may be performed, in which the material compressing on the nerve is removed.<ref name=":2" /> A mutli-level laminectomy can be done to widen the spinal canal in the case of spinal stenosis. A [[foraminotomy]] or foraminectomy may also be necessary, if the vertebrae are causing significant nerve root compression.<ref name=":2" /> A discectomy is performed when the intervertebral disc has herniated or torn.

If infection, such as a [[Spinal epidural abscess|spinal epidural absces]]s, is the source of the back pain, surgery may be indicated when a trial of antibiotics is ineffective.<ref name=":2" /> Surgical evacuation of spinal [[hematoma]] can also be attempted, if the blood products fail to break down on their own.<ref name=":2" />

About 50% of women experience low back pain during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostgaard HC, Andersson GB, Karlsson K | title = Prevalence of back pain in pregnancy | journal = Spine | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–52 | date = May 1991 | pmid = 1828912 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-199105000-00011 | s2cid = 5546397 }}</ref> Some studies have suggested that women who have experienced back pain before pregnancy are at a higher risk of experiencing back pain during pregnancy.<ref name=":03">{{Cite book|title=High risk pregnancy : management options|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier| vauthors = James DK, Steer PJ |isbn=978-1416059080|edition=4th|location=St. Louis, MO|oclc=727346377}}</ref> It may be severe enough to cause significant pain and disability in as many as one third of pregnant women.<ref name="Katonis20112">{{cite journal | vauthors = Katonis P, Kampouroglou A, Aggelopoulos A, Kakavelakis K, Lykoudis S, Makrigiannakis A, Alpantaki K | title = Pregnancy-related low back pain | journal = Hippokratia | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = July 2011 | pmc = 3306025 | pmid = 22435016 }}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=Practical management of pain| vauthors = Benzon HT, Rathmell JP, Wu CL, Turk DC, Argoff CE, Hurley RW |isbn=978-0323083409|edition=Fifth|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=859537559 |date=2013}}</ref> Back pain typically begins at approximately 18 weeks of [[gestation]] and peaks between 24 and 36 weeks.<ref name=":13" /> Approximately 16% of women who experience back pain during pregnancy report continued back pain years after pregnancy, indicating that those with significant back pain are at greater risk of back pain following pregnancy.<ref name="Katonis20112" /><ref name=":13" />

Biomechanical factors of pregnancy shown to be associated with back pain include increased curvature of the lower back, or [[Lordosis|lumbar lordosis]], to support the added weight on the abdomen.<ref name=":13" /> Also, the hormone [[relaxin]] is released during pregnancy, which softens the structural tissues in the pelvis and lower back to prepare for [[vaginal delivery]]. This softening and increased flexibility of the ligaments and joints in the lower back can result in pain.<ref name=":13" /> Back pain in pregnancy is often accompanied by [[Radiculopathy|radicular symptoms]], suggested to be caused by the baby pressing on the [[sacral plexus]] and [[lumbar plexus]] in the pelvis.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":03" />

Typical factors aggravating the back pain of pregnancy include standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting and walking. Back pain in pregnancy may also be characterized by pain radiating into the thigh and buttocks, nighttime pain severe enough to wake the patient, pain that is increased at night or pain that is increased during the daytime.<ref name="Katonis20112" />

Local heat, [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) and massage can be used to help relieve pain. Avoiding standing for prolonged periods of time is also suggested.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conn's Current Therapy |date=2017|publisher=Elsevier| vauthors = Bope ET, Kellerman RD, Conn HF |isbn=978-0323443203|location=Philadelphia|oclc=961064076}}</ref>

==Economics==
Although back pain does not typically cause permanent disability, it is a significant contributor to physician visits and missed work days in the United States, and is the single leading cause of disability worldwide.<ref name=":6" /><ref name="2010 Global Burden of Disease Study" /> The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons report approximately 12 million visits to doctor's offices each year are due to back pain.<ref name=":5" /> Missed work and disability related to low back pain costs over $50 billion each year in the United States.<ref name=":5" /> In the United Kingdom in 1998, approximately £1.6 billion per year was spent on expenses related to disability from back pain.<ref name=":5" />
