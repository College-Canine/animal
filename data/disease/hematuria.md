'''Hematuria''' or '''haematuria''' is defined as the presence of [[blood]] or [[red blood cell]]s in the [[urine]].<ref name=":3" /> "Gross hematuria" occurs when urine appears red, brown, or tea-colored due to the presence of blood. Hematuria may also be subtle and only detectable with a microscope or laboratory test.<ref name=":1" /> Blood that enters and mixes with the urine can come from any location within the [[urinary system]], including the [[kidney]], [[ureter]], [[urinary bladder]], [[urethra]], and in men, the [[prostate]].<ref name=":4" /> Common causes of hematuria include [[Urinary tract infection|urinary tract infection (UTI)]], [[Kidney Stones|kidney stones]], viral illness, trauma, bladder cancer, and exercise.<ref name=":0" /> These causes are grouped into glomerular and non-glomerular causes, depending on the involvement of the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus of the kidney]].<ref name=":3" /> But not all red urine is hematuria.<ref name=":93" /> Other substances such as certain medications and foods (e.g. blackberries, beets, food dyes) can cause urine to appear red.<ref name=":93" /> [[Menstruation]] in women may also cause the appearance of hematuria and may result in a positive urine dipstick test for hematuria.<ref name=":2" /> A [[Urine test strip|urine dipstick]] test may also give an incorrect positive result for hematuria if there are other substances in the urine such as [[myoglobin]], a protein excreted into urine during [[rhabdomyolysis]]. A positive [[urine dipstick]] test should be confirmed with microscopy, where hematuria is defined by three or more red blood cells per [[High-power field|high power field]].<ref name=":2" /> When hematuria is detected, a thorough history and physical examination with appropriate further evaluation (e.g. laboratory testing) can help determine the underlying cause.<ref name=":3" />

Many causes may present as either visible hematuria or microscopic hematuria, and so the differential diagnosis is frequently organized based on glomerular and non-glomerular causes.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Glomerular hematuria ===
[[File:The presence of blood in urine bag.jpg|thumb|Postrenal hematuria - the presence of blood in urine (because of damage to the urethra and prostate).]]
Hematuria due to a glomerular source commonly presents as dysmorphic red blood cells (misshapen red blood cells) or [[urinary cast|red cell casts]] (small tubular structures made up of red blood cell components) on urine microscopy. This occurs due to the red blood cells being deformed as they pass through the [[glomerular capillaries]] into the renal tubules and eventually into the urinary system.<ref name="Ingelfinger 2021">{{cite journal |last1=Ingelfinger |first1=Julie R. |date=8 July 2021 |title=Hematuria in Adults |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=385 |issue=2 |pages=153–163 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1604481}}</ref> Normally, red blood cells should never pass from the glomerular capillary into the renal tubule, and this is always a pathological process. Glomerular causes include:
* [[IgA nephropathy]]<ref name=":0" />

=== Non-glomerular hematuria ===
Visible blood clots in the urine indicate a non-glomerular cause.<ref name=":2" /> Non-glomerular causes include:
* [[Urinary tract infection]]s, such as [[pyelonephritis]], [[cystitis]], [[prostatitis]], and [[urethritis]]<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />
* [[Kidney Stones|Kidney stones]]<ref name=":0" />

* Urinary tract strictures<ref name=":2" />
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]]<ref name=":2" />
* [[Renal papillary necrosis]]<ref name=":2" />
* Trauma or damage to the lining of the urinary tract<ref name=":0" />
* Intense exercise<ref name=":0" />
* Increased tendency to bleed due to acquired or genetic conditions (e.g. [[sickle cell disease]] or [[vitamin K deficiency bleeding]]) or certain medications (e.g. [[blood thinner]]s)<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Mimickers of hematuria ===

==== Pigmenturia ====
Not all red or brown urine is caused by hematuria.<ref name=":4" /> Other substances such as certain medications and certain foods can cause urine to appear red.<ref name=":4" />

Medications that may cause urine to appear red include:
* [[Phenazopyridine]]<ref name=":2" />
* [[Nitrofurantoin]]<ref name=":2" />
* [[Doxorubicin]]<ref name=":2" />
* [[Rifampicin]]<ref name=":2" />

Foods that may cause urine to appear red include:
* [[Blackberry|Blackberries]]<ref name=":2" />
* Food dyes.<ref name=":2" />
* [[Beets]]<ref name=":4" />
* [[Rhubarb]]<ref name=":4" />
* [[Fava beans]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Changes in Urine; Symptoms, Causes & Treatment |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15357-urine-changes |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=Cleveland Clinic}}</ref>

==== False positive urine dipstick ====
A [[urine dipstick]] may be falsely positive for hematuria due to other substances in the urine.<ref name=":2" /> While the urine dipstick test is able to recognize [[heme]] in red blood cells, it also identifies free hemoglobin and myoglobin.<ref name=":2" /> Free hemoglobin may be found in the urine resulting from [[hemolysis]], and [[myoglobin]] may be found in the urine resulting from [[rhabdomyolysis]] (muscle breakdown).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":93">{{Cite book|last1=McAninch|first1=Jack W.|title=Smith & Tanagho's General Urology|last2=Lue|first2=Tom|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2013|pages=|chapter=Chapter 3: Symptoms of Disorders of the Genitourinary Tract}}</ref> Thus, a positive dipstick test does not necessarily indicate hematuria; rather, microscopy of the urine showing three of more red blood cells per [[High-power field|high power field]] confirms hematuria.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

==== Menstruation ====
In women, [[menstruation]] may cause the appearance of hematuria and may result in a urine dipstick test positive for hematuria.<ref name=":4" /> Menstruation can be ruled out as a cause of hematuria by inquiring about menstruation history and ensuring the urine specimen is collected without menstrual blood.<ref name=":4" />

== Evaluation ==
The evaluation of hematuria is dependent upon the visibility of the blood in the urine (i.e. visible/gross vs microscopic hematuria).<ref name=":2" /> Visible hematuria must be investigated, as it may be due to a pathological cause.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /> In those with visible hematuria, urological cancer (most frequently bladder or kidney cancer) is discovered in 20–25%.<ref name=":4" /> Hematuria alone without accompanying symptoms should be raise suspicion of malignancy of the urinary tract until proven otherwise.<ref name=":93" /> The initial evaluation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms that are consistent of hematuria include assessment of hemodynamic status, underlying cause of hematuria, and ensuring urinary drainage. These steps include assessment of the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, a physician exam taken by a healthcare professional, and blood work to ensure the patient's hemodynamic status is adequate.<ref name="Avellino 503–515">{{Cite journal |last1=Avellino |first1=Gabriella J. |last2=Bose |first2=Sanchita |last3=Wang |first3=David S. |date=June 2016 |title=Diagnosis and Management of Hematuria |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039610916000098 |journal=Surgical Clinics of North America |language=en |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=503–515 |doi=10.1016/j.suc.2016.02.007|pmid=27261791 }}</ref> It is important to obtain a detailed history from the patient (i.e. recreational, occupational, and medication exposures) as this information can be helpful in suggesting a cause of hematuria.<ref name="Yun 329–343">{{Cite journal |last1=Yun |first1=Edward J. |last2=Meng |first2=Maxwell V. |last3=Carroll |first3=Peter R. |date=March 2004 |title=Evaluation of the patient with hematuria |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002571250300172X |journal=Medical Clinics of North America |language=en |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=329–343 |doi=10.1016/S0025-7125(03)00172-X|pmid=15049581 }}</ref> The physical exam can also be helpful in identifying a cause of the hematuria as certain signs found on the physical exam can suggest specific causes of the hematuria.<ref name="Yun 329–343"/> In the event the initial evaluation of hematuria does not reveal an underlying cause  then evaluation by a physician who specializes in Urology may proceed. This medical evaluation may consist of, but is not limited too, a history and physical exam taken by healthcare personnel, laboratory studies (i.e. blood work), cystoscopy, and specialized imaging procedures (i.e. CT or MRI).<ref name="Avellino 503–515"/>

=== Visible hematuria ===
The first step in evaluation of red or brown colored urine is to confirm true hematuria with urinalysis and urine microscopy, where hematuria is defined by three of more red blood cells per [[High-power field|high power field]].<ref name=":4" /> Although a urine dipstick test may be used, it can give false positive or false negative results.<ref name=":0" /> In gathering information, it is important to inquire about recent trauma, urologic procedures, [[menses]], and culture-documented [[urinary tract infection]].<ref name=":4" /> If any of these are present, it is appropriate to repeat a urinalysis with urine microscopy in 1 to 2 weeks or after treatment of the infection.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> If the results of the urinalysis and urine microscopy reveal a glomerular origin of hematuria (indicated by [[proteinuria]] or [[Red cell cast|red blood cell casts]]), consultation with a [[nephrologist]] should be made.<ref name=":2" /> If the results of the urinalysis indicate a non-glomerular origin, a [[microbiological culture]] of the urine should be performed, if it has not been done already.<ref name=":2" /> If the culture is positive (indicating a bladder infection), urinalysis and urine microscopy should be repeated following treatment to confirm resolution of the hematuria.<ref name=":2" /> If the culture is negative or if hematuria persists after treatment, [[Computed tomography urography|CT urogram]] or [[renal ultrasound]] and [[cystoscopy]] should be performed.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Ingelfinger 2021" /> Hemodynamic stability should be monitored and a [[complete blood count]] should be ordered to assess for anemia.<ref name=":4" />

=== Microscopic hematuria ===

== Pathophysiology ==
The [[pathophysiology]] of hematuria can often be explained by damage to the structures of the [[Urinary tract|urinary system]], including the [[kidney]], [[ureter]], [[urinary bladder]], and [[urethra]], and in men, the [[prostate]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> Common mechanisms include structural disruption to the [[glomerular basement membrane]] and mechanical or chemical erosion of the mucosal surfaces of the [[Genitourinary system|genitourinary tract]].<ref name=":0" />

== Management ==
=== Medical emergency: acute clot retention ===
[[File:Toomey syringe 60.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 60cc/mL Toomey syringe. {{ordered list|class=hlist | Fill syringe with saline. | Connect syringe to a catheter port. | Instill 180cc of saline. | Draw back 180cc of bladder urine. | Dispose of medical waste. | Repeat until all clots are removed.}}]]
Acute clot retention is one of three emergencies that can occur with hematuria.<ref name=":52">{{Cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Damara|last2=Kohn|first2=Taylor|title=Urologic Emergencies: Gross Hematuria with Clot Retention|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/auauniversity/for-medical-students/medical-students-curriculum/medical-student-curriculum/urologic-emergencies|access-date=2019-12-11|website=American Urological Association|archive-date=2019-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128125248/https://www.auanet.org/education/auauniversity/for-medical-students/medical-students-curriculum/medical-student-curriculum/urologic-emergencies|url-status=dead}}</ref> The other two are [[anemia]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name=":52" /> Blood clots can prevent urine outflow through either ureter or the bladder.<ref name=":52" /> This is known as [[Urinary retention|acute urinary retention.]]

Blood clots that remain in the bladder are digested by urinary urokinase producing fibrin fragments.<ref name=":52" /> These fibrin fragments are natural [[anticoagulant]]s and promote ongoing bleeding from the urinary tract.<ref name=":52" /> Removing all blood clots prevents the formation of this natural anticoagulant.<ref name=":52" /> This in turns facilitates the cessation of bleeding from the urinary tract.<ref name=":52" />

The acute management of obstructing clots is the placement of a large (22–24 French) urethral [[Foley catheter]].<ref name=":52" /> Clots are evacuated with a Toomey syringe and saline irrigation.<ref name=":52" /> If this does not control the bleeding, management should escalate to continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) via a three-port urethral catheter.<ref name=":52" /> If both a large urethral Foley catheter and CBI fail, an urgent cystoscopy in the operating room will be necessary.<ref name=":52" /> Lastly, a transfusion and/or a correction of a coexisting coagulopathy may be necessary.<ref name=":52" />

=== Medical emergency: urosepsis ===
Urosepsis is defined as sepsis caused by a urogenital tract infection and comprises about 25% of all sepsis cases.<ref name="Wagenlehner n/a–n/a">{{Cite journal |last1=Wagenlehner |first1=Florian M.

The prevalence of microscopic hematuria in [[North Africa]] is very high due to the high prevalence of the blood fluke [[schistosoma haematobium]], which chronically infects the urinary tract.<ref name="Ingelfinger 2021" /> 

In pediatric populations, the prevalence is 0.5–2%.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Samir|title=Step-up to pediatrics|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|last2=Ronan |first2=Jeanine C. |last3=Alverson |first3=Brian|year=2014|isbn=978-1451145809|edition=first|location=Philadelphia|pages=175–176|oclc=855779297}}</ref> Risks factor include older age and female gender.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Robert A.|last2=Brown|first2=Robert S.|date=2003-06-05|title=Clinical practice.
