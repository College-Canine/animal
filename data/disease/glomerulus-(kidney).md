The '''glomerulus''' ({{plural form}}: '''glomeruli''') is a network of small blood vessels ([[capillaries]]) known as a ''tuft'',  located at the beginning of a [[nephron]] in the [[kidney]]. Each of the two kidneys contains about one million nephrons. The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium (the space between the blood vessels), composed of [[Intraglomerular mesangial cell|intraglomerular mesangial cells]]. The [[blood]] is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier, which yields its [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|filtrate]] of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as [[Bowman's capsule]]. The filtrate then enters the [[Nephron#Renal tubule|renal tubule]] of the nephron.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Pavenstädt H |author2=Kriz W |author3=Kretzler M | title=Cell biology of the glomerular podocyte.|journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=253–307 | pmid=12506131 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00020.2002|year=2003 }}</ref>

The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an [[afferent arteriole]] of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into [[efferent arteriole]]s rather than [[venule]]s. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for [[ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]].

The glomerulus and its surrounding [[Bowman's capsule]] constitute a [[renal corpuscle]], the basic filtration unit of the kidney.{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=304}} The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall kidney function, is the [[renal function|glomerular filtration rate]].

(b) Micrograph showing the glomerulus and surrounding structures.]]
The glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries located within [[Bowman's capsule]] within the kidney.{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=304}} Glomerular mesangial cells structurally support the tufts. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an [[afferent arteriole]] and leaves by an [[efferent arteriole]].{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=307}} The capillaries consist of a tube lined by [[endothelial cell]]s with a central [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. The gaps between these endothelial cells are called fenestrae. The walls have a unique structure: there are pores between the cells that allow water and soluble substances to exit and after passing through the [[glomerular basement membrane]] and between [[podocyte]] foot processes, enter the capsule as ultrafiltrate.

===Lining===
[[File:Inner view of fenestrae in capillary of glomerulus in Scanning Electron Microscope, magnification 100,000x.GIF|thumb|240px |Scanning electron microscope view of the inner surface of an opened (broken) capillary with fenestrae visible (100,000x magnification)]]
Capillaries of the glomerulus are lined by [[endothelial cell]]s. These contain numerous pores—also called [[Fenestra (histology)|fenestrae]]—, 50–100&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] in diameter.{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=310}} Unlike those of other capillaries with fenestrations, these fenestrations are not spanned by diaphragms.{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=310}} They allow for the filtration of fluid, [[blood plasma]] solutes and protein, at the same time preventing the filtration of [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and [[platelets]].

The glomerulus has a [[glomerular basement membrane]] sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the [[podocytes]]. It consists mainly of [[laminin]]s, type IV [[collagen]], [[agrin]], and [[nidogen]], which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes. The glomerular basement membrane is 250–400&nbsp;nm in thickness, which is thicker than basement membranes of other tissue. It is a barrier to blood proteins such as [[albumin]] and [[globulin]].<ref name=suh>{{cite journal|last1=Suh|first1=JH|last2=Miner|first2=JH|title=The glomerular basement membrane as a barrier to albumin|journal=Nature Reviews. Nephrology|date=2013|volume=9|issue=8|pages=470–477|pmid=23774818|pmc=3839671|doi=10.1038/nrneph.2013.109}}</ref>

The part of the podocyte in contact with the glomerular basement membrane is called a ''podocyte foot process'' or ''pedicle'' (Fig. 3): there are gaps between the foot processes through which the [[Ultrafiltration (renal)|filtrate]] flows into Bowman's capsule.{{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=310}} The space between adjacent podocyte foot processes is spanned by [[slit diaphragm]]s consisting of a mat of proteins, including [[podocin]] and [[nephrin]]. In addition, foot processes have a negatively charged coat ([[glycocalyx]]) that repels negatively charged molecules such as [[serum albumin]].

===Mesangium===
The mesangium is a space which is continuous with the smooth muscles of the arterioles. It is outside the capillary [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] but surrounded by capillaries. It is in the middle (meso) between the capillaries (angis). It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium.

The mesangium contains mainly:
* [[Intraglomerular mesangial cells]]. They are not part of the filtration barrier but are specialized [[pericytes]] that participate in the regulation of the filtration rate by contracting or expanding: they contain actin and myosin filaments to accomplish this. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate.
* ''Mesangial matrix'', an amorphous [[basement membrane]]-like material secreted by the mesangial cells.

===Blood supply===
[[File:2611 Blood Flow in the Nephron.jpg|thumbnail|Diagram of the circulation related to a single glomerulus, associated tubule, and collecting system]]

The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an [[afferent arteriole]] of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into [[efferent arteriole]]s rather than [[venule]]s. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for [[ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]].

Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an [[efferent arteriole|efferent]] [[arteriole]] instead of a [[venule]], as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. 4). {{sfn|Wheater|2006|p=307}} This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular [[smooth muscle]] layer ([[tunica media]]). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal [[venule]], which in turn enters a renal [[interlobular vein]] and then into the [[renal vein]].

Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called [[juxtamedullary nephron]]s. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the [[Straight arterioles of kidney|vasa recta]], which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the [[renal medulla]]. These vasa recta run adjacent to the descending and ascending [[loop of Henle]] and participate in the maintenance of the medullary [[countercurrent exchange]] system.

===Filtrate drainage===
The filtrate that has passed through the three-layered filtration unit enters Bowman's capsule. From there, it flows into the renal tubule—the nephron—which follows a U-shaped path to the [[collecting duct]]s, finally exiting into a [[renal calyx]] as [[urine]].

==Function==
===Filtration===
[[File:Filtration barrier.svg|thumb|350px|Scheme of filtration barrier (blood-urine) in the kidney. A. The endothelial cells of the glomerulus; 1. pore (fenestra).<br /> B. Glomerular basement membrane: 1. lamina rara interna 2. lamina densa 3. lamina rara externa <br />
C. Podocytes: 1. enzymatic and structural proteins 2. filtration slit 3. diaphragma]]
The main function of the glomerulus is to filter [[Blood plasma|plasma]] to produce glomerular filtrate, which passes down the length of the [[nephron]] tubule to form urine. The rate at which the glomerulus produces filtrate from plasma (the [[Renal function#Glomerular filtration rate|glomerular filtration rate]]) is much higher than in systemic capillaries because of the particular anatomical characteristics of the glomerulus. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance [[arteriole]]s and drain to low-resistance [[venule]]s, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the [[afferent arteriole]], and the [[efferent arteriole]]. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high [[hydrostatic pressure]] on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favor filtration to Bowman's capsule.<ref name=boron>{{cite book|last1=Boron|first1=WF.|last2=Boulapep|first2=EL.|title=Medical Physiology|date=2012|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|pages=771, 774|isbn=978-1437717532|edition=2nd}}</ref>

If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, [[glomerular basement membrane]], and [[podocyte]]s, then it enters the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate. Otherwise, it exits the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and continues circulation as discussed below and as shown on the picture.

====Permeability====
{{anchor|Permselectivity}}<!--Permselectivity redirects here-->
{{See also|Table of permselectivity for different substances}}
The structures of the layers determine their [[Vascular permeability|permeability]]-selectivity (''permselectivity''). The factors that influence permselectivity are the [[negative charge]] of the basement membrane and the podocytic epithelium, as well as the effective pore size of the glomerular wall (8&nbsp;nm). As a result, large and/or negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than small and/or positively charged ones.<ref name="guyton11">{{Cite book |author1=Guyton, Arthur C. |author2=Hall, John E. | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |url=https://archive.org/details/textbookmedicalp09guyt |url-access=limited | year=2006 | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-0-7216-0240-0 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/textbookmedicalp09guyt/page/n351 316]–317}}</ref> For instance, small ions such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] pass freely, while larger proteins, such as [[hemoglobin]] and [[albumin]] have practically no permeability at all.

The [[oncotic pressure]] on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration. Because large and negatively charged proteins have a low permeability, they cannot filtrate easily to Bowman's capsule. Therefore, the concentration of these proteins tends to increase as the glomerular capillaries filtrate plasma, increasing the oncotic pressure along the glomerular capillary.<ref name=boron />

====Starling equation====
The rate of filtration from the glomerulus to Bowman's capsule is determined (as in systemic capillaries) by the [[Starling equation]]:<ref name=boron />

:<math>\ GFR = K_\mathrm{f} ((P_\mathrm{gc} - P_\mathrm{bc}) - (\pi_\mathrm{gc} - \pi_\mathrm{bc}))</math>
* {{math|''GFR''}} is the [[glomerular filtration rate]]
* {{math|''K''<sub>f</sub>}} is the filtration coefficient—a proportionality constant
* {{math|''P''<sub>gc</sub>}} is the glomerular capillary [[hydrostatic pressure]]
* {{math|''P''<sub>bc</sub>}} is the Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure
* {{math|''π''<sub>gc</sub>}} is the glomerular capillary [[oncotic pressure]]
* {{math|''π''<sub>bc</sub>}} is the Bowman's capsule oncotic pressure

===Blood pressure regulation===
The walls of the afferent arteriole contain specialized [[smooth muscle]] cells that synthesize [[renin]]. These [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s play a major role in the [[renin–angiotensin system]], which helps regulate [[blood volume]] and [[blood pressure|pressure]].

==Clinical significance==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Damage to the glomerulus by disease can allow passage through the glomerular filtration barrier of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood proteins such as albumin and globulin. Underlying causes for glomerular injury can be inflammatory, toxic or metabolic.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1= Wiggins, RC | title=The spectrum of podocytopathies: a unifying view of glomerular diseases | journal=Kidney International | volume=71 | issue=12 | pages=1205–1214 | pmid=17410103 | doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5002222| year=2007 | doi-access=free }}</ref> These can be seen in the urine ([[urinalysis]]) on microscopic and chemical (dipstick) examination.  Glomerular diseases include [[diabetic kidney disease]], [[glomerulonephritis]] (inflammation),  [[glomerulosclerosis]] (hardening of the glomeruli), and [[IgA nephropathy]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Glomerular Diseases: What Is It, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5993-glomerular-diseases |access-date=2022-07-27 |website=Cleveland Clinic}}</ref>

Due to the connection between the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate, the glomerular filtration rate is of clinical significance when suspecting a kidney disease, or when following up a case with known kidney disease, or when risking a development of renal damage such as beginning medications with known [[nephrotoxicity]].<ref>Gerard J.

==History==
In 1666, Italian biologist and anatomist [[Marcello Malpighi]] first described the glomeruli and demonstrated their continuity with the renal vasculature (281,282). About 175 years later, surgeon and anatomist [[Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet|William Bowman]] elucidated in detail the capillary architecture of the glomerulus and the continuity between its surrounding capsule and the proximal tubule.<ref name="eb">"lippicotts histology for pathologesits; satcey e. mills</ref>
