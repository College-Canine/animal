</ref> Potassium is necessary for the function of all living cells, and is thus present in all plant and animal tissues. It is found in especially high concentrations within plant cells, and in a mixed diet, it is most highly concentrated in fruits. The high concentration of potassium in plants, associated with comparatively very low amounts of sodium there, historically resulted in potassium first being isolated from the ashes of plants ([[potash]]), which in turn gave the element its modern name. The high concentration of potassium in plants means that heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium, and agricultural fertilizers consume 93% of the potassium chemical production of the modern world economy.

The functions of potassium and sodium in living organisms are quite different. Animals, in particular, employ sodium and potassium differentially to generate electrical potentials in animal cells, especially in [[nervous tissue]]. Potassium depletion in animals, including humans, results in various neurological dysfunctions. Characteristic concentrations of potassium in model organisms are: 30–300mM in ''E. coli'', 300mM in budding yeast, 100mM in mammalian cell and 4mM in blood plasma.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-concentrations-of-different-ions-in-cells/|title= Cell Biology by the Numbers: What are the concentrations of different ions in cells?|website= book.bionumbers.org|first1= Ron|last1= Milo|first2= Rob|last2= Philips|access-date= 23 March 2017|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041741/http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-concentrations-of-different-ions-in-cells/|archive-date= 20 April 2017}}</ref>

==Function in animals==
Potassium is the major [[cation]] (K<sup>+</sup>, a positive ion) inside [[Cell (biology)|animal cells]], while [[sodium]] (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the major cation outside animal cells. The difference between the [[concentrations]] of these charged particles causes a difference in [[electric potential]] between the inside and outside of cells, known as the [[membrane potential]].  The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by [[ion transporter]]s in the [[cell membrane]]. All [[potassium ion channels]] are tetramers with several conserved secondary structural elements. A number of potassium channel structures have been [[X-ray crystallography|solved]] including [[Voltage-gated potassium channel|voltage gated]],<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=23095758 |

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. [[National Academy of Medicine]] (NAM), on behalf of both the U.S. and Canada, sets [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s, including Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs) for when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

For both males and females under 9 years of age, the AIs for potassium are: 400{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 0 to 6-month-old infants, 860{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 7 to 12-month-old infants, 2,000{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 1 to 3-year-old children, and 2,300{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 4 to 8-year-old children.

For males 9 years of age and older, the AIs for potassium are: 2,500{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 9 to 13-year-old males, 3,000{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old males, and 3,400{{nbsp}}mg for males that are 19 years of age and older.

For females 9 years of age and older, the AIs for potassium are: 2,300{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 9 to 18-year-old females, and 2,600{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for females that are 19 years of age and older.

For pregnant and lactating females, the AIs for potassium are: 2,600{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old pregnant females, 2,900{{nbsp}}mg for pregnant females that are 19 years of age and older; furthermore, 2,500{{nbsp}}mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old lactating females, and 2,800{{nbsp}}mg for lactating females that are 19 years of age and older. As for safety, the NAM also sets [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL was established.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine |editor3-first=Maria |editor3-last=Oria |editor2-first=Meghan |editor2-last=Harrison |editor1-first=Virginia A |editor1-last=Stallings |date=2019 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium |location=Washington, DC |publisher=The National Academies Press |chapter=Potassium: Dietary Reference Intakes for Adequacy |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/25353/chapter/8 |isbn= 978-0-309-48834-1|doi=10.17226/25353 |doi-access=free |pmid=30844154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2019/dietary-reference-intakes-sodium-potassium.aspx |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium – Publication |date=March 5, 2019 |website=Health and Medicine Division |publisher=National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine |doi=10.17226/25353 |pmid=30844154 |isbn=978-0-309-48834-1 |s2cid=104464967 |access-date=May 13, 2019 |editor1-last=Stallings |editor1-first=Virginia A |editor2-first=Meghan |editor2-last=Harrison |editor3-first=Maria |editor3-last=Oria }}</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3,500&nbsp;mg/day. AIs for pregnancy is 3,500&nbsp;mg/day, for lactation 4,000&nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 800 to 2,700&nbsp;mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs.<ref>{{cite web| title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf| archive-date = 2017-08-28}}</ref> The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient data to establish a UL for potassium.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160316225123/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf| archive-date = 2016-03-16}}</ref>

==Food sources==
Eating a variety of foods that contain potassium is the best way to get an adequate amount. 
Foods with high sources of potassium include [[kiwifruit]], [[orange juice]], [[potato]]es, [[coconut]], [[avocado]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[parsnip]]s and [[turnip]]s, although many other [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, legumes, and meats contain potassium.

=== Hypokalemia ===
A severe shortage of potassium in body fluids may cause a potentially fatal condition known as [[hypokalemia]].  Hypokalemia typically results from loss of potassium through  [[diarrhea]], [[:wikt:diuresis|diuresis]], or vomiting. Symptoms are related to alterations in  membrane potential and cellular metabolism.  Symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, paralytic [[ileus]], ECG abnormalities, intestinal paralysis, decreased reflex response and (in severe cases) respiratory paralysis, [[alkalosis]] and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].

In rare cases, habitual consumption of large amounts of black licorice has resulted in hypokalemia. Licorice contains a compound ([[Glycyrrhizin]]) that increases urinary excretion of potassium.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mumoli N, Cei M |title=Licorice-induced hypokalemia |journal=Int. J.

=== Insufficient intake ===
Adult women in the United States consume on average half the AI, for men two-thirds. For all adults, fewer than 5% exceed the AI.<ref>[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf What We Eat In America, NHANES 2013-2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224042515/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf |date=2017-02-24 }}.</ref> Similarly, in the [[European Union]], insufficient potassium intake is widespread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ProduktNr=223977&Ausgabe=230671&ArtikelNr=83312&filename=83312.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135630/http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ProduktNr=223977&Ausgabe=230671&ArtikelNr=83312&filename=83312.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-13 }} Energy and Nutrient Intake in the European Union</ref>

== Side effects and toxicity ==

Gastrointestinal  symptoms are the most common side effects of potassium supplements, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.  Taking potassium with meals or taking a  microencapsulated form of potassium may reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

[[Hyperkalemia]] is the most serious adverse reaction to potassium.  Hyperkalemia occurs when potassium builds up faster than the kidneys can remove it. It is most common in individuals with [[renal failure]].  Symptoms of hyperkalemia may include tingling of the hands and feet, muscular weakness, and temporary paralysis. The most serious complication of hyperkalemia is the development of an abnormal heart rhythm ([[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]), which can lead to cardiac arrest.

Although hyperkalemia is rare in healthy individuals, oral doses greater than 18&nbsp;grams taken at one time in individuals not accustomed to high intakes can lead to hyperkalemia.
