===Vitamin D deficiency===
{{Main|Vitamin D deficiency}}
Cholecalciferol is a form of vitamin D which is naturally synthesized in skin and functions as a pro-hormone, being converted to [[calcitriol]]. This is important for maintaining calcium levels and promoting bone health and development.<ref name=Norman/> As a medication, cholecalciferol may be taken as a dietary supplement to prevent or to treat vitamin D deficiency. One gram is 40,000,000 (40x10<sup>6</sup>) [[International unit|IU]], equivalently 1 IU is 0.025&nbsp;μg or 25 ng. Dietary reference intake values for vitamin D ([[ergocalciferol]] which is D<sub>2</sub> and/or cholecalciferol which is D<sub>3</sub>) have been established and recommendations vary depending on the country: 
*In the US: 15&nbsp;μg/d (600 IU per day) for all individuals (males, females, pregnant/lactating women) between the ages of 1 and 70 years old, inclusive. For all individuals older than 70 years, 20&nbsp;μg/d (800 IU per day) is recommended.<ref name="Institute of Medicine">[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D/DRI-Values.aspx DRIs for Calcium and Vitamin D] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224064915/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D/DRI-Values.aspx |date=24 December 2010 }}</ref>
*In the EU: 15&nbsp;μg/d (600 IU per day) for all people older than 1 year and 10&nbsp;μg/d (400 IU per day) for infants aged 7–11 months, assuming minimal cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.<ref name="European Food Safety Agency">{{cite web | url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4547 | title=Dietary reference values for vitamin D &#124; EFSA | date=28 October 2016 }}</ref>
*In the UK: a ‘Safe Intake’ (SI) of 8.5-10&nbsp;μg/day (30-400 IU per day) for infants < 1 year (including exclusively breastfed infants) and a SI of 10&nbsp;μg/day (400 IU per day) for children aged 1 to <4 years; for all other population groups aged 4 years and more (including pregnant/lactating women) a Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) of 10&nbsp;μg/day (400 IU per day).<ref name="Scientif Advisory Commitee on Nutrition">{{Cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/news/explanatory_note_EFSA_SACN_vitaminD.pdf|title=Joint explanatory note by the European Food Safety Authority and the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition regarding dietary reference values for vitamin D}}</ref>

Low levels of vitamin D are more commonly found in individuals living in northern latitudes, or with other reasons for a lack of regular sun exposure, including being housebound, frail, elderly, obese, having darker skin, or wearing clothes that cover most of the skin.<ref name="pmid19543765">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mithal A, Wahl DA, Bonjour JP, Burckhardt P, Dawson-Hughes B, Eisman JA, El-Hajj Fuleihan G, Josse RG, Lips P, Morales-Torres J | title = Global vitamin D status and determinants of hypovitaminosis D | journal = Osteoporos Int | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 1807–20 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19543765 | doi = 10.1007/s00198-009-0954-6 | s2cid = 52858668 | url = https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/4861a0b5-49a4-47e2-bbb4-dda46208c058}}</ref><ref name = "NHSVD">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-D.aspx |title=Vitamins and minerals – Vitamin D |website=[[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] |date=3 August 2020 |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref> Supplements are recommended for these groups of people.<ref name = "NHSVD" />

There are conflicting reports concerning the relative effectiveness of cholecalciferol (D<sub>3</sub>) versus [[ergocalciferol]] (D<sub>2</sub>), with some studies suggesting less efficacy of D<sub>2</sub>, and others showing no difference.

==Biochemistry==
=== Structure ===
Cholecalciferol is one of the five forms of [[vitamin D]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000020436|cholecalciferol}}</ref> Cholecalciferol is a [[secosteroid]], that is, a steroid molecule with one ring open.<ref name="River">{{cite web |url=http://vitamind.ucr.edu/about/ |title=About Vitamin D |publisher=University of California, Riverside |date=November 2011 |access-date=15 October 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014311/http://vitamind.ucr.edu/about/ |archive-date=16 October 2017 }}</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
By itself cholecalciferol is inactive. It is converted to its active form by two [[hydroxylation]]s: the first in the liver, by [[CYP2R1]] or [[CYP27A1]], to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol ([[calcifediol]], 25-OH vitamin D<sub>3</sub>). The second hydroxylation occurs mainly in the kidney through the action of [[CYP27B1]] to convert 25-OH vitamin D<sub>3</sub> into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol ([[calcitriol]], 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>vitamin D<sub>3</sub>). All these metabolites are bound in blood to the [[vitamin D-binding protein]]. The action of calcitriol is mediated by the [[vitamin D receptor]], a [[nuclear receptor]] which regulates the synthesis of hundreds of proteins and is present in virtually every cell in the body.<ref name=Norman/>

{{VitaminDSynthesis_WP1531|highlight=Cholecalciferol}}

[[7-Dehydrocholesterol]] is the precursor of cholecalciferol.<ref name=Norman/> Within the epidermal layer of skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol undergoes an [[electrocyclic reaction]] as a result of [[Ultraviolet light#Subtypes|UVB light]] at [[wavelengths]] between 290 and 315&nbsp;nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295 and 300&nbsp;nm.<ref name="WackerHolick2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wacker M, Holick MF | title = Sunlight and Vitamin D: A global perspective for health | journal = Dermato-Endocrinology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–108 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 24494042 | pmc = 3897598 | doi = 10.4161/derm.24494 }}</ref> This results in the opening of the vitamin precursor B-ring through a [[Conrotatory and disrotatory|conrotatory]] pathway making [[previtamin D3|previtamin D<sub>3</sub>]] (pre-cholecalciferol).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLaughlin JA, Anderson RR, Holick MF | s2cid = 23011680 | title = Spectral character of sunlight modulates photosynthesis of previtamin D3 and its photoisomers in human skin | journal = Science | volume = 216 | issue = 4549 | pages = 1001–3 | date = May 1982 | pmid = 6281884 | doi = 10.1126/science.6281884 | bibcode = 1982Sci...216.1001M }}</ref> In a process which is independent of UV light, the pre-cholecalciferol then undergoes a [1,7] antarafacial [[Sigmatropic reaction|sigmatropic]] rearrangement <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Okamura WH, Elnagar HY, Ruther M, Dobreff S | title = Thermal [1,7]-sigmatropic shift of previtamin D<sub>3</sub> to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>: synthesis and study of pentadeuterio derivatives | journal = Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 58 | pages = 600–610 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1021/jo00055a011 | issue = 3 }}</ref> and therein finally isomerizes to form vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.

The active UVB wavelengths are present in sunlight, and sufficient amounts of cholecalciferol can be produced with moderate exposure of the skin, depending on the strength of the sun.<ref name="WackerHolick2013"/> Time of day, season, latitude, and altitude affect the strength of the sun, and pollution, cloud cover or glass all reduce the amount of UVB exposure. Exposure of face, arms and legs, averaging 5–30 minutes twice per week, may be sufficient, but the darker the skin, and the weaker the sunlight, the more minutes of exposure are needed. Vitamin D overdose is impossible from UV exposure; the skin reaches an equilibrium where the vitamin degrades as fast as it is created.<ref name="WackerHolick2013"/>

Cholecalciferol can be produced in skin from the light emitted by the UV lamps in [[tanning bed]]s, which produce ultraviolet primarily in the [[Ultraviolet light#Subtypes|UVA]] spectrum, but typically produce 4% to 10% of the total UV emissions as UVB. Levels in blood are higher in frequent users of tanning salons.<ref name="WackerHolick2013"/>

Whether cholecalciferol and all forms of vitamin D are by definition "[[vitamins]]" can be disputed, since the definition of vitamins includes that the substance cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested. Cholecalciferol ''is'' synthesized by the body during UVB radiation exposure.<ref name=Norman/>

The three steps in the synthesis and activation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> are regulated as follows:
* Cholecalciferol is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol under the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) light. It reaches an equilibrium after several minutes depending on the intensity of the UVB in the sunlight – determined by latitude, season, cloud cover, and altitude – and the age and degree of pigmentation of the skin.
* Hydroxylation in the endoplasmic reticulum of liver [[hepatocyte]]s of cholecalciferol to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) by [[CYP2R1|25-hydroxylase]] is loosely regulated, if at all, and blood levels of this molecule largely reflect the amount of cholecalciferol produced in the skin combined with any vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> ingested.
* Hydroxylation in the kidneys of calcifediol to calcitriol by [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase|1-alpha-hydroxylase]] is tightly regulated: it is stimulated by [[parathyroid hormone]] and serves as the major control point in the production of the active circulating hormone [[calcitriol]] (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>).<ref name=Norman/>

==Industrial production==
Cholecalciferol is produced industrially for use in [[multivitamin|vitamin supplement]]s and [[food fortification|to fortify foods]]. As a [[pharmaceutical drug]] it is called cholecalciferol ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) or colecalciferol ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]). It is produced by the [[ultraviolet]] irradiation of [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] extracted from [[lanolin]] found in sheep's [[wool]].<ref name="AGD Nutrition">[http://www.agdnutrition.com/d3-story.html Vitamin D3 Story.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122031423/http://www.agdnutrition.com/d3-story.html |date=22 January 2012 }} Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> Cholesterol is extracted from wool grease and wool wax alcohols obtained from the cleaning of wool after shearing. The cholesterol undergoes a four-step process to make 7-dehydrocholesterol, the same compound that is produced in the skin of animals. The 7-dehydrocholesterol is then irradiated with ultraviolet light. Some unwanted [[isomers]] are formed during irradiation: these are removed by various techniques, leaving a resin which melts at about room temperature and usually has a potency of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 International Units per gram.

==Stability==
Cholecalciferol is very sensitive to [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] and will rapidly, but reversibly, break down to form supra-sterols, which can further irreversibly convert to [[ergosterol]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Rodents are somewhat more susceptible to high doses than other species, and cholecalciferol has been used in poison bait for the control of these pests.<ref name=vertebratePestProceedings1984>{{cite conference |title=CHOLECALCIFEROL: A UNIQUE TOXICANT FOR RODENT CONTROL |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/vpc11/22/ |conference=Proceedings of the Eleventh Vertebrate Pest Conference (1984) |publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln |date=March 1984 |quote=Cholecalciferol is an acute (single-feeding) and/or chronic (multiple-feeding) rodenticide toxicant with unique activity for controlling commensal rodents including anticoagulant-resistant rats.
