<!-- Definition and sympstoms -->
'''Hepatocellular carcinoma''' ('''HCC'''<ref name=shetty/>) is the most common type of primary [[liver cancer]] in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with [[cirrhosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Forner A, Llovet JM, Bruix J | title = Hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Lancet | volume = 379 | issue = 9822 | pages = 1245–1255 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22353262 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61347-0 | s2cid = 24927898 }}</ref> HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Global Cancer Observatory|url=http://gco.iarc.fr/|access-date=2021-06-24|website=gco.iarc.fr}}</ref>

<!-- Cause -->
The development of HCC is attributed to fibrosis and cirrhosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. The latter being closely linked to chronic viral [[hepatitis]] infection ([[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C|C]]) or exposure to toxins such as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[aflatoxin]], or [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan DJ, Wong C, Ng CH, Poh CW, Jain SR, Huang DQ, Muthiah MD | title = A Meta-Analysis on the Rate of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence after Liver Transplant and Associations to Etiology, Alpha-Fetoprotein, Income and Ethnicity | journal = Journal of Clinical Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 238 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 33440759 | pmc = 7828059 | doi = 10.3390/jcm10020238 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Certain diseases, such as [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] and [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]], markedly increase the risk of developing HCC.

<!-- Treatment -->
As with any cancer, the treatment and prognosis of HCC vary depending on the specifics of tumor histology, size, [[metastasis|how far the cancer has spread]], and overall health.

<!-- Epidemiology -->
The vast majority of HCC cases and the lowest survival rates after treatment occur in [[Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]], in countries where [[Hepatitis B|hepatitis B infection]] is endemic and many are infected from birth. The incidence of HCC in the [[United States]] and other developing countries is increasing due to an increase in hepatitis C virus infections. It is more than three times as common in males as in females, for unknown reasons.<ref name="Robbins_Cotran_2015" />{{rp|870–873}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Most cases of HCC occur in people who already have signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease. They may present with worsening symptoms or without symptoms at the time of cancer detection. HCC may present with non-specific symptoms such as  [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[Fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]].<ref name=":6" /> Some symptoms that are more closely associated with liver disease include [[jaundice|yellow skin]] (also called jaundice), abdominal swelling due to [[ascites|fluid in the abdominal cavity]], easy bruising from [[Coagulopathy|blood clotting abnormalities]], [[loss of appetite]], unintentional weight loss, [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[Fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]].<ref name=":6">{{cite web |title=Liver cancer overview |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/liver-cancer/DS00399/DSECTION=symptoms |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
Since HCC mostly occurs in people with [[Cirrhosis|cirrhosis of the liver]], risk factors generally include factors which cause chronic liver disease that may lead to cirrhosis. Still, certain risk factors are more highly associated with HCC than others. For example, while heavy alcohol consumption is estimated to cause 60–70% of cirrhosis, the vast majority of HCC occurs in cirrhosis attributed to viral hepatitis (although there may be overlap).<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelbaugh JJ, Bruderly M | title = Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part I.

Certain benign liver tumors, such as [[hepatocellular adenoma]], may sometimes be associated with coexisting malignant HCC. Evidence is limited for the true incidence of malignancy associated with benign adenomas; however, the size of hepatic adenoma is considered to correspond to risk of malignancy and so larger tumors may be surgically removed. Certain subtypes of adenoma, particularly those with [[Catenin beta-1|β-catenin]] activation mutation, are particularly associated with increased risk of HCC.<ref name="auto"/>

== Pathogenesis ==
{{See also|Carcinogenesis}}
Hepatocellular carcinoma, like any other cancer, develops when [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations and mutations affecting the cellular machinery cause the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or result in the cell avoiding [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid24473361">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shibata T, Aburatani H | title = Exploration of liver cancer genomes | journal = Nature Reviews.

In particular, chronic infections of [[hepatitis B]] and/or [[Hepatitis C|C]] can aid the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by repeatedly causing the body's own immune system to attack the [[hepatocyte|liver cells]], some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CJ, Yang HI, Su J, Jen CL, You SL, Lu SN, Huang GT, Iloeje UH | display-authors = 6 | title = Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma across a biological gradient of serum hepatitis B virus DNA level | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–73 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16391218 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.1.65 | doi-access =  }}</ref>  Activated immune-system inflammatory cells release free radicals, such as [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[Reactive nitrogen species|nitric oxide reactive species]], which in turn can cause DNA damage and lead to [[Carcinogenesis|carcinogenic]] gene mutations.<ref name="pmid24877058">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang SF, Chang CW, Wei RJ, Shiue YL, Wang SN, Yeh YT | title = Involvement of DNA damage response pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = BioMed Research International | volume = 2014 | pages = 153867 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24877058 | pmc = 4022277 | doi = 10.1155/2014/153867 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Reactive oxygen species also cause epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair.<ref name="pmid24281019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishida N, Kudo M | title = Oxidative stress and epigenetic instability in human hepatocarcinogenesis | journal = Digestive Diseases | volume = 31 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 447–453 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24281019 | doi = 10.1159/000355243 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair, which in turn lead to carcinogenesis, this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a noncirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, [[alcohol use disorder|repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol]] can have a similar effect. The toxin [[aflatoxin]] from certain ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species of fungi is a carcinogen and aids carcinogenesis of hepatocellular cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings such as  [[China]] and [[West Africa]] has led to relatively high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection, thus are not related to HCC.<ref name="auto"/>

==Diagnosis==

Methods of diagnosis in HCC have evolved with the improvement in medical imaging. The evaluation of both asymptomatic patients and those with symptoms of liver disease involves blood testing and imaging evaluation. Historically, a [[biopsy]] of a tumor was required to prove an HCC diagnosis. However, imaging (especially MRI) findings may be conclusive enough without [[Histopathology|histopathologic]] confirmation.<ref name="auto"/>

===Screening===
HCC remains associated with a high mortality rate, in part because initial diagnosis commonly occurs at an advanced stage of disease. As with other cancers, outcomes are significantly improved if treatment is initiated earlier in the disease process. Since the vast majority of HCC cases occur in people with certain chronic liver diseases, especially those with cirrhosis, liver screening is commonly advocated in this population. Specific screening guidelines continue to evolve over time as evidence of its clinical impact becomes available. In the United States, the most commonly observed guidelines are those published by the [[American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases]](AASLD), which recommends ultrasound screenings every six months for people with cirrhosis, with or without measurement of blood levels of tumor marker [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP).<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heimbach JK, Kulik LM, Finn RS, Sirlin CB, Abecassis MM, Roberts LR, Zhu AX, Murad MH, Marrero JA | display-authors = 6 | title = AASLD guidelines for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Hepatology | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 358–380 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28130846 | doi = 10.1002/hep.29086 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Elevated levels of AFP are associated with active HCC disease, though their reliability can be inconsistent.

On ultrasound, HCC often appears as a small hypoechoic lesion with poorly defined margins and coarse, irregular internal echoes. When the tumor grows, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous with fibrosis, fatty change, and calcifications. This heterogeneity can look similar to cirrhosis and the surrounding liver parenchyma. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 60% (95% CI 44–76%) and specificity was 97% (95% CI 95–98%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. The sensitivity increases to 79% with AFP correlation.<ref name="Colli A et al.">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colli A, Fraquelli M, Casazza G, Massironi S, Colucci A, Conte D, Duca P | title = Accuracy of ultrasonography, spiral CT, magnetic resonance, and alpha-fetoprotein in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–523 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16542288 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00467.x | s2cid = 9563077 }}</ref>

Controversy remains as to the most effective screening protocols. For example, while some data support decreased mortality related to screening people with hepatitis B infection, the AASLD notes, “There are no randomized trials [for screening] in Western populations with cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C or fatty liver disease, and thus there is some controversy surrounding whether surveillance truly leads to a reduction in mortality in this population of patients with cirrhosis.”<ref name=":4" />

===Higher risk people===
In a person where a higher suspicion of HCC exists, such as a person with symptoms or abnormal blood tests (i.e. [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and [[des-gamma carboxyprothrombin]] levels),<ref name="AFP_DCP">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ertle JM, Heider D, Wichert M, Keller B, Kueper R, Hilgard P, Gerken G, Schlaak JF | display-authors = 6 | title = A combination of α-fetoprotein and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin is superior in detection of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Digestion | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–131 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23406785 | doi = 10.1159/000346080 | s2cid = 25266129 }}</ref> evaluation requires imaging of the liver by [[CT scan|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans. Optimally, these scans are performed with [[radiocontrast|intravenous contrast]] in multiple phases of hepatic perfusion to improve detection and accurate classification of any liver lesions by the interpreting [[radiologist]]. Due to the characteristic blood flow pattern of HCC tumors, a specific perfusion pattern of any detected liver lesion may conclusively detect an HCC tumor. Alternatively, the scan may detect an indeterminate lesion and further evaluation may be performed by obtaining a physical sample of the lesion.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/benign-liver-tumors/ | title= Benign Liver Tumors | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 4 July 2021}}</ref>

===Imaging===
[[File:Triphasic CT scan of hepatocellular carcinoma.jpg|thumb|Triphasic [[contrast CT]] of hepatocellular carcinoma.]]
Ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI may be used to evaluate the liver for HCC. On CT and MRI, HCC can have three distinct patterns of growth:{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}
* A single large tumor
* Multiple tumors
* Poorly defined tumor with an infiltrative growth pattern

A systematic review of CT diagnosis found that the sensitivity was 68% (95% CI 55–80%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI 89–96%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard. With triple-phase helical CT, the sensitivity was 90% or higher, but these data have not been confirmed with autopsy studies.<ref name="Colli A et al." />

However, MRI has the advantage of delivering high-resolution images of the liver without ionizing radiation. HCC appears as a high-intensity pattern on T2-weighted images and a low-intensity pattern on T1-weighted images. The advantage of MRI is that it has improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to ultrasound and CT in cirrhotic patients with whom it can be difficult to differentiate HCC from regenerative nodules. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 70–91%) and specificity was 85% (95% CI 77–93%) compared with pathologic examination of an explanted or resected liver as the reference standard.<ref name="Colli A et al." /> The sensitivity is further increased if [[MRI contrast agent|gadolinium contrast-enhanced]] and diffusion-weighted imaging are combined.

MRI is more [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and specific]] than CT.<ref name="pmid18471552">{{cite journal | vauthors = El-Serag HB, Marrero JA, Rudolph L, Reddy KR | title = Diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1752–1763 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18471552 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.02.090 | s2cid = 10418520 }}</ref>

[[LI-RADS|Liver image reporting and data system]] (LI-RADS) is a classification system for the reporting of liver lesions detected on CT and MRI. Radiologists use this standardized system to report on suspicious lesions and to provide an estimated likelihood of malignancy. Categories range from LI-RADS (LR) 1 to 5, in order of concern for cancer.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Resources/LIRADS | title=Li-Rads | access-date=2014-02-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711092124/https://www.acr.org/quality-safety/resources/lirads | archive-date=2017-07-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A biopsy is not needed to confirm the diagnosis of HCC if certain imaging criteria are met.<ref name="auto"/>

===Pathology===
[[File:Hepatocellular carcinoma intermed mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of hepatocellular carcinoma. [[Liver biopsy]]. [[Trichrome stain]].]]
Macroscopically, liver cancer appears as a nodular or infiltrative tumor. The nodular type may be solitary (large mass) or multiple (when developed as a complication of cirrhosis). Tumor nodules are round to oval, gray or green (if the tumor produces bile), well circumscribed but not encapsulated. The diffuse type is poorly circumscribed and infiltrates the portal veins, or the hepatic veins (rarely).<ref name="auto"/>

Microscopically, the four architectural and cytological types (patterns) of hepatocellular carcinoma are: [[fibrolamellar]], [[pseudoglandular]] ([[adenoid]]), [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]] (giant cell), and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]], [[anaplastic]], and giant. The tumor has a scant stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization.<ref>[http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/poorly-differentiated-hepatocellular-carcinoma-liver-pathology.php Hepatocellular carcinoma (Photo)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211101012401/https://www.pathologyatlas.ro/poorly-differentiated-hepatocellular-carcinoma-liver-pathology.php |date=2021-11-01 }} ATLAS OF PATHOLOGY</ref> A fifth form – lymphoepithelioma like hepatocellular carcinoma – has also been described.<ref name=Chan2019>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan AW, Zhang Z, Chong CC, Tin EK, Chow C, Wong N | title = Genomic landscape of lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 249 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–172 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31168847 | doi = 10.1002/path.5313 | s2cid = 174815950 }}</ref><ref name=Chan2-15>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan AW, Tong JH, Pan Y, Chan SL, Wong GL, Wong VW, Lai PB, To KF | display-authors = 6 | title = Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma: an uncommon variant of hepatocellular carcinoma with favorable outcome | journal = The American Journal of Surgical Pathology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 304–312 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25675010 | doi = 10.1097/pas.0000000000000376 | s2cid = 40384842 }}</ref>

===Staging===
'''BCLC Staging System'''

The prognosis of HCC is affected by the staging of the tumor and the liver's function due to the effects of liver cirrhosis.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duseja A | title = Staging of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology | volume = 4 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S74–S79 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25755615 | pmc = 4284240 | doi = 10.1016/j.jceh.2014.03.045 }}</ref>

A number of staging classifications for HCC are available. However, due to the unique nature of the carcinoma to fully encompass all the features that affect the categorization of the HCC, a classification system should incorporate tumor size and number, presence of vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread, liver function (levels of serum bilirubin and albumin, presence of ascites, and portal hypertension) and general health status of the patient (defined by the [[Performance status|ECOG classification]] and the presence of symptoms).<ref name=":0" />

Of all the staging classification systems available, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification encompasses all of the above characteristics. This staging classification can be used to select people for treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Llovet JM, Brú C, Bruix J | title = Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: the BCLC staging classification | journal = Seminars in Liver Disease | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–338 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10518312 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-1007122 | s2cid = 23889399 }}</ref>

Important features that guide treatment include:
* size
* spread ([[staging (pathology)|stage]])
* involvement of liver vessels
* presence of a tumor capsule
* presence of extrahepatic metastases
* presence of daughter nodules
* vascularity of the tumor

MRI is the best imaging method to detect the presence of a tumor capsule.

The most common sites of metastasis are the lung, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone.<ref name="KatyalOliver2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Katyal S, Oliver JH, Peterson MS, Ferris JV, Carr BS, Baron RL | title = Extrahepatic metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Radiology | volume = 216 | issue = 3 | pages = 698–703 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10966697 | doi = 10.1148/radiology.216.3.r00se24698 }}</ref>

==Prevention==
Since hepatitis B and C are some of the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma, prevention of infection is key to then prevent HCC. Thus, childhood [[vaccination]] against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future.<ref name=WHO_GAR>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index5.html |title=Hepatitis B: Prevention and treatment |access-date=28 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724080242/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index5.html |archive-date=24 July 2013 }} "WHO aims at controlling HBV worldwide to decrease the incidence of HBV-related chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. by integrating HB vaccination into routine infant (and possibly adolescent) immunization programs."</ref>  In the case of patients with cirrhosis, alcohol consumption is to be avoided.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma varies by the stage of disease, a person's likelihood to tolerate surgery, and availability of liver transplant:
# Curative intention: for limited disease, when the cancer is limited to one or more areas of within the liver, surgically removing the malignant cells may be curative. This may be accomplished by resection the affected portion of the liver (partial hepatectomy) or in some cases by orthotopic liver transplantation of the entire organ.{{cn|date=November 2022}}
# "Bridging" intention: for limited disease which qualifies for potential liver transplantation, the person may undergo targeted treatment of some or all of the known tumor while waiting for a donor organ to become available.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pompili M, Francica G, Ponziani FR, Iezzi R, Avolio AW | title = Bridging and downstaging treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 19 | issue = 43 | pages = 7515–7530 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24282343 | pmc = 3837250 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v19.i43.7515 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
# "Downstaging" intention: for moderately advanced disease which has not spread beyond the liver, but is too advanced to qualify for curative treatment. The person may be treated by targeted therapies in order to reduce the size or number of active tumors, with the goal of once again qualifying for liver transplant after this treatment.<ref name=":3" />
# Palliative intention: for more advanced disease, including spread of cancer beyond the liver or in persons who may not tolerate surgery, treatment intended to decrease symptoms of disease and maximize duration of survival.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

Loco-regional therapy (also referred to as liver-directed therapy) refers to any one of several minimally-invasive treatment techniques to focally target HCC within the liver. These procedures are alternatives to surgery, and may be considered in combination with other strategies, such as a later liver transplantation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gbolahan OB, Schacht MA, Beckley EW, LaRoche TP, O'Neil BH, Pyko M | title = Locoregional and systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–228 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28480062 | pmc = 5401862 | doi = 10.21037/jgo.2017.03.13 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Generally, these treatment procedures are performed by [[Interventional radiology|interventional radiologists]] or surgeons, in coordination with a medical oncologist. Loco-regional therapy may refer to either percutaneous therapies (e.g. cryoablation), or arterial catheter-based therapies (chemoembolization or radioembolization).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== Surgical resection ===
[[File:HepatoCellular Ca.JPG|thumb|Gross anatomy of hepatocellular carcinoma]]

[[Segmental resection|Surgical removal]] of the tumor is associated with better cancer prognosis, but only 5–15% of patients are suitable for surgical resection due to the extent of disease or poor liver function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marrero JA, Kulik LM, Sirlin CB, Zhu AX, Finn RS, Abecassis MM, Roberts LR, Heimbach JK | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis, Staging, and Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: 2018 Practice Guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases | journal = Hepatology | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 723–750 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29624699 | doi = 10.1002/hep.29913 | s2cid = 4666537 | doi-access = free }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Surgery is only considered if the entire tumor can be safely removed while preserving sufficient functional liver to maintain normal physiology. Thus, preoperative [[Medical imaging|imaging]] assessment is critical  to determine both the extent of HCC and to estimate the amount of residual liver remaining after surgery.

=== Liver transplantation ===
[[Liver transplantation]], replacing the diseased liver with a cadaveric or a living donor liver, plays an increasing role in treatment of HCC. Although outcomes following liver transplant were initially poor (20%–36% survival rate),<ref name="auto"/> outcomes have significantly improved with improvement in surgical techniques and adoption of the [[Milan criteria]] at US transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China have resulted in overall survival and disease-free survival rates similar to those achieved using the Milan criteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan J, Yang GS, Fu ZR, Peng ZH, Xia Q, Peng CH, Qian JM, Zhou J, Xu Y, Qiu SJ, Zhong L, Zhou GW, Zhang JJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Liver transplantation outcomes in 1,078 hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a multi-center experience in Shanghai, China | journal = Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology | volume = 135 | issue = 10 | pages = 1403–1412 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19381688 | doi = 10.1007/s00432-009-0584-6 | s2cid = 1216580 }}</ref> Studies from the late 2000s obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vitale A, Gringeri E, Valmasoni M, D'Amico F, Carraro A, Pauletto A, D'Amico FJ, Polacco M, D'Amico DF, Cillo U | display-authors = 6 | title = Long-term results of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: an update of the University of Padova experience | journal = Transplantation Proceedings | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 1892–1894 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17692645 | doi = 10.1016/j.transproceed.2007.05.031 }}</ref>

The risks of liver transplantation extend beyond risk of the procedure itself. The immunosuppressive medication  required after surgery to prevent rejection of the donor liver also impairs the body's natural ability to combat dysfunctional cells. If the tumor has spread undetected outside the liver before the transplant, the medication effectively increases the rate of disease progression and decreases survival. With this in mind, liver transplant "can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obed A, Tsui TY, Schnitzbauer AA, Obed M, Schlitt HJ, Becker H, Lorf T | title = Liver transplantation as curative approach for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: is it justified? | journal = Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery | volume = 393 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–147 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18043937 | pmc = 1356504 | doi = 10.1007/s00423-007-0250-x | doi-access = free }}</ref> In fact, among patients with compensated cirrhosis, transplantation is not associated with improved survival compared to hepatectomy, but instead is significantly more expensive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michelakos T, Xourafas D, Qadan M, Pieretti-Vanmarcke R, Cai L, Patel MS, Adler JT, Fontan F, Basit U, Vagefi PA, Elias N, Tanabe KK, Berger D, Yeh H, Markmann JF, Chang DC, Ferrone CR | display-authors = 6 | title = Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Transplantable Child-Pugh A Cirrhotics: Should Cost Affect Resection vs Transplantation? | journal = Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 1135–1142 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 30218342 | doi = 10.1007/s11605-018-3946-z | s2cid = 52275656 }}</ref> Patient selection is considered a major key for success.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cillo U, Vitale A, Bassanello M, Boccagni P, Brolese A, Zanus G, Burra P, Fagiuoli S, Farinati F, Rugge M, D'Amico DF | display-authors = 6 | title = Liver transplantation for the treatment of moderately or well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 239 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–159 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14745321 | pmc = 1356206 | doi = 10.1097/01.sla.0000109146.72827.76 }}</ref>

=== Ablation ===
* [[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA) uses high-frequency radio waves to destroy tumor by local heating. The electrodes are inserted into the liver tumor under ultrasound image guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors (<5&nbsp;cm). RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanabe KK, Curley SA, Dodd GD, Siperstein AE, Goldberg SN | title = Radiofrequency ablation: the experts weigh in | journal = Cancer | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 641–650 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14745883 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.11919 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival is better for those with smaller tumors. In one study, In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions >5&nbsp;cm, 2.1 to 5&nbsp;cm, and ≤2&nbsp;cm were 59, 74, and 91%, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tateishi R, Shiina S, Teratani T, Obi S, Sato S, Koike Y, Fujishima T, Yoshida H, Kawabe T, Omata M | display-authors = 6 | title = Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma.

* [[Cryoablation]] is a technique used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe into the center of the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to −190&nbsp;°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then refrozen to −190&nbsp;°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient  spends the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit and typically is discharged in 3–5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection, as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
* [[Percutaneous ethanol injection]] is well tolerated, with high RR in small (<3&nbsp;cm) solitary tumors; as of 2005, no randomized trial has comparing resection to percutaneous treatments; recurrence rates are similar to those for postresection. However, a comparative study found that local therapy can achieve a 5-year survival rate  around 60% for patients with small HCC.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto J, Okada S, Shimada K, Okusaka T, Yamasaki S, Ueno H, Kosuge T | title = Treatment strategy for small hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison of long-term results after percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and surgical resection | journal = Hepatology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 707–713 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11584366 | doi = 10.1053/jhep.2001.27950 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

=== Arterial catheter-based treatment ===
* [[Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization]] (TACE) is performed for unresectable tumors or as a temporary treatment while waiting for liver transplant ("bridge to transplant"). TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. [[cisplatin]]) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure is to restrict the tumor's vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE has been shown to increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists.<ref name="SIR">{{cite web |title=Interventional Radiology Treatments for Liver Cancer |url=http://www.sirweb.org/patients/liver-cancer/. |publisher=Society of Interventional Radiology |access-date=4 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208230701/http://www.sirweb.org/patients/liver-cancer/ |archive-date=8 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression, but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit is seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of [[vascular invasion]], and smallest tumors.

* [[Selective internal radiation therapy]] (SIRT) can be used to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature, causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kooby DA, Egnatashvili V, Srinivasan S, Chamsuddin A, Delman KA, Kauh J, Staley CA, Kim HS | display-authors = 6 | title = Comparison of yttrium-90 radioembolization and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 224–230 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20022765 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2009.10.013 }}</ref> Two products are available, [[SIR-Spheres]] and [[TheraSphere]].

=== Africa and Asia ===
In some parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, HCC is the most common cancer, generally affecting men more than women, and with an age of onset between the late teens and 30s.<ref name="auto"/> This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations – infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death, the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months ([[median]] survival time) in sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. HCC is one of the deadliest cancers in China, where chronic hepatitis B is found in 90% of cases. In [[Japan]], chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. Foods infected with ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' (especially [[peanut]]s and corns stored during prolonged wet seasons) which produces aflatoxins pose another risk factor for HCC.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-03-20 |title=Aflatoxins - Cancer-Causing Substances - NCI |url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins |access-date=2023-08-21 |website=www.cancer.gov |language=en}}</ref>
<!-- In the Eastern Asian hemisphere, HCCis the most common type of cancer. The common risk factor for HCC in Asia is the high diagnosis of hepatitis B. However, in Japan, the common risk factor is hepatitis C. Another factor is that causes HCC is a mycotoxin called aflatoxin.

Acute and chronic hepatic [[porphyrias]] (acute intermittent [[porphyria]], [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], [[hereditary coproporphyria]], [[variegate porphyria]]) and tyrosinemia type I are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis of an acute hepatic porphyria (AIP, HCP, VP) should be sought in patients with HCC without typical risk factors of hepatitis B or C, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or hemochromatosis. Both active and latent genetic carriers of acute hepatic porphyrias
are at risk for this cancer, although latent genetic carriers have developed the cancer at a later age than those with classic symptoms. Patients with acute hepatic porphyrias should be monitored for HCC.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The incidence of HCC is relatively lower in the Western Hemisphere than in Eastern Asia.
