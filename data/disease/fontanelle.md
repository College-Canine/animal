A '''fontanelle''' (or '''fontanel''') (colloquially, '''soft spot''') is an [[human body|anatomical feature]] of the infant [[human skull]] comprising soft [[Membrane|membranous]] gaps ([[suture (joint)|sutures]]) between the cranial bones that make up the [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]] of a [[fetus]] or an [[infant]].<ref name=TheFreeDictionary>{{cite web|title=fontanelle|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fontanelle|publisher=TheFreeDictionary|access-date=24 April 2013}}</ref> Fontanelles allow for stretching and deformation of the [[neurocranium]] both during birth and later as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow.<ref name=CARTA>{{cite web|last=Beasley|first=Melanie|title=Age of Closure of Fontanelles / Sutures|url=http://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/age-closure-fontanelles-sutures|publisher=[[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA)|access-date=24 April 2013}}</ref> Premature complete [[ossification]] of the sutures is called [[craniosynostosis]].

After infancy, the [[anterior fontanelle]] is known as the [[bregma]].

==Structure==
An infant's skull consists of five main bones: two [[frontal bone]]s, two [[parietal bone]]s, and one [[occipital bone]]. These are joined by fibrous [[sutures of skull|sutures]], which allow movement that facilitates [[childbirth]] and [[Human brain|brain]] [[cell growth|growth]].

* '''[[Posterior fontanelle]]''' is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the [[sagittal suture]] and [[lambdoid suture]]. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough [[biological membrane|membrane]], where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the [[Lambda (anatomy)|lambda]]). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 6–8 weeks after birth. This is called intramembranous ossification.  The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.
* '''[[Anterior fontanelle]]''' is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the [[coronal suture]] and [[sagittal suture]]. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In [[cleidocranial dysostosis]], however, it is often late in closing at 8–24 months or may never close.  Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.
* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).
During birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The [[ossification]] of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months.<ref>"USMLE Step 2: Secrets".editor1=Theodore X. O'Connell.editor2=Adam Brochert.book=USMLE Step 2: Secrets.ed=3rd.page=271</ref> The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the [[mastoid fontanelle]] and the [[sphenoidal fontanelle]] are also significant.

===Closure===
In humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:<ref name=CARTA /><ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003310>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003310|Fontanelles – bulging}}</ref>
# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 2 to 3 months after birth;
# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;
# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and
# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12 and 18 months.

==Clinical significance==
The fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the [[meninges]]. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name – fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning "spring". It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fontanelle|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-04-02}}</ref>

Parents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called "soft-spots", the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.<ref name="Boundless" />

Fontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]]. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.<ref name="Boundless">{{cite web|title=Fontanels|url=https://www.boundless.com/physiology/textbooks/boundless-anatomy-and-physiology-textbook/skeletal-system-parts-of-the-skeleton-7/the-skull-79/fontanels-465-2064/|website=Boundless|access-date=3 October 2016}}</ref>

==Disorders==
===Bulging===
A very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally.<ref>[[Stephen Waxman|Waxman, Stephen G.]] Clinical Neuroanatomy. 25th ed. New York: Lange Medical /McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division, 2003.</ref> It can occur due to:<ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003310/>
* [[Craniosynostosis]] – premature fusion of the cranial sutures<ref>{{Cite web |title=Craniosynostosis |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/craniosynostosis |access-date=2022-10-04 |website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org |language=en}}</ref>
* [[Encephalitis]] – swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections
* [[Hydrocephalus]] – a buildup of fluid inside the skull
* [[Meningitis]] – infection of the membranes covering the brain
* [[Shaken baby syndrome]]

===Sunken===
A sunken (also called "depressed") fontanelle indicates [[dehydration]] or [[malnutrition]].<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003309|Fontanelles – sunken}}</ref>

===Enlarged===
The fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close, or may never close, most commonly due to causes like:<ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003311>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003311|Fontanelles – enlarged}}</ref> 
* [[Down syndrome]]
* [[Hydrocephalus]]
* [[Intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR)
* [[preterm birth|Premature birth]]

Rarer causes include:<ref name=MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003311/>
* [[Achondroplasia]]
* [[Apert syndrome]]
* [[Cleidocranial dysostosis]]
* [[Congenital rubella syndrome|Congenital rubella]]
* [[Congenital hypothyroidism|Neonatal hypothyroidism]]
* [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]
* [[Rickets]]

===Third===
Sometimes there is a third bigger fontanelle other than posterior and anterior ones in a newborn. In one study, the frequency of third fontanelles in an unselected population of newborn infants was 6.3%. It is very common in [[Down syndrome]] and some congenital infections. If present, the physician should rule out serious conditions associated with the third fontanelle.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(69)80457-9/pdf|doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(69)80457-9|title = The third fontanelle|year = 1969|last1 = Chemke|first1 = Juan|last2 = Robinson|first2 = Arthur|journal = The Journal of Pediatrics|volume = 75|issue = 4|pages = 617–622|pmid = 4241462}}</ref>

==Other animals==
===Primates===
In apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.<ref name=CARTA />

===Dogs===
One of the more serious problems that can affect [[canidae|canine]]s is known as an "open fontanelle", which occurs when the skull bones at the top of the head fail to close. The problem is often found in conjunction with hydrocephalus, which is a condition in which too much fluid is found within and around the brain, placing pressure on the brain and surrounding tissues. Often the head will appear dome-shaped, and the open fontanelle is noticeable as a "soft spot" on the top of the dog's head. The fluid-filled spaces within the brain, known as ventricles, also become swollen. The increased pressure damages or prevents the development of brain tissue.<ref name=TerrificPets>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrificpets.com/articles/10266465.asp |title=Open Skull Bones May, May Not Be Sign of Deadly Disorder |publisher=Terrificpets.com |access-date=2012-10-24}}</ref>

Not all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog's owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal's head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.

An open fontanelle, known as a [[molera]], is a recognized feature of the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] breed. The [[American Kennel Club]] breed standard states that the skull of the Chihuahua should be domed, with or without the molera being present.<ref>{{Cite web|title=American Kennel Club – Chihuahua breed standard|url=https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Chihuahua.pdf}}</ref> However, the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (FCI) standard for the Chihuahua lists an open fontanelle as a disqualification.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FCI Chihuahua breed standard|url=http://www.fci.be/nomenclature/Standards/218g09-en.pdf}}</ref>
