The '''Cairn Terrier''' is a [[terrier]] breed originating in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and recognised as one of Scotland's earliest [[working dog]]s.

The name “Cairn Terrier” was a compromise suggestion when the breed was brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909, initially under the name “Short-haired Skye terrier”. This name was not accepted by The Kennel Club when faced with opposition from breeders of the [[Skye Terrier]]. The alternative name Cairn Terrier was adopted.

==History==
Cairn terriers originated in the Scottish Highlands and the [[Isle of Skye]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Cairn Terrier History|url=https://www.akc.org/breeds/cairn_terrier/history.cfm|publisher=American Kennel Club|access-date = 26 October 2014 }}</ref> initially grouped in the "Skye Terrier" class alongside the Scottish and [[West Highland White Terrier]]s. From the early 1900s, the three were bred separately.

The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered, and the breed was given Championship status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swwectc.freeuk.com/cairnhis.html|title=swwectc- cairn history|website=www.swwectc.freeuk.com|access-date=2016-11-26|archive-date=2018-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018051447/http://www.swwectc.freeuk.com/cairnhis.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Cairn Terrier has a harsh, weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or [[brindle]]d. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many [[kennel club]]s. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the [[American Kennel Club]] required them to be registered as [[West Highland White Terrier]]s. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is [[double-coated]], with a soft, dense [[Down hair|undercoat]] and a harsh [[guard hair|outer coat]]. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free of artifice. The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903.

Cairn Terriers tend to look similar to [[Norwich Terrier]]s, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur). The outer layer of fur is shaggy, but they have a soft, downy undercoat. The ideal weight is 4.5-7.3&nbsp;kg (10-16&nbsp;lb), and the height 9–13 in (23–33&nbsp;cm).
