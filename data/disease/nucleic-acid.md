[[File:Difference_DNA_RNA-EN.svg|thumb|Nucleic acids [[RNA]] (left) and [[DNA]] (right).]]
'''Nucleic acids''' are large [[biomolecule]]s that are crucial in all cells and viruses.<ref name="genome">{{cite web |title=Nucleic Acid |url=https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Nucleic-Acid |website=Genome.gov |access-date=1 January 2022 |language=en}}</ref> They are composed of [[nucleotide]]s, which are the [[monomer]] components: a [[pentose|5-carbon sugar]], a [[phosphate group]] and a [[nitrogenous base]]. The two main classes of nucleic acids are [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). If the [[sugar]] is [[ribose]], the [[polymer]] is RNA; if the sugar is [[deoxyribose]], a variant of ribose, the polymer is DNA.

Nucleic acids are chemical compounds that are found in nature. They carry information in cells and make up genetic material. These acids are very common in all living things, where they create, encode, and store information in every living cell of every [[outline of life forms|life-form]] on Earth. In turn, they send and express that information inside and outside the cell nucleus. From the inner workings of the cell to the young of a living thing, they contain and provide information via the [[nucleic acid sequence]]. This gives the RNA and DNA their unmistakable 'ladder-step' order of nucleotides within their molecules. Both play a crucial role in directing [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]].

Strings of nucleotides are bonded to form spiraling backbones and assembled into chains of bases or base-pairs selected from the five [[nucleobase|primary, or canonical, nucleobases]]. RNA usually forms a chain of single bases, whereas DNA forms a chain of base pairs. The bases found in RNA and DNA are: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]]. Thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil only in RNA. Using [[amino acid]]s and [[protein synthesis]],<ref>{{cite web|title=What is DNA|url=http://www.whatisdna.net|website=What is DNA|publisher=Linda Clarks|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref> the specific sequence in DNA of these [[base pair|nucleobase-pairs]] helps to keep and send [[code#Genetic code|coded]] instructions as [[gene]]s. In RNA, base-pair sequencing helps to make new proteins that determine most chemical processes of all life forms.

== History ==
[[File:Friedrich Miescher.jpg|thumb|The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[scientist]] [[Friedrich Miescher]] discovered nucleic acid first naming it as nuclein, in 1868. Later, he raised the idea that it could be involved in [[heredity]].<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'', Broadway Books, 2015.p. 500.</ref>]]
Nucleic acid was first discovered by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869 at the [[University of Tübingen]], Germany. He gave its first name as '''nuclein'''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–81 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17901982 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-007-0433-0 | s2cid = 915930 }}</ref>
In the early 1880s [[Albrecht Kossel]] further purified the substance and discovered its highly acidic properties. He later also identified the [[nucleobase]]s.
In 1889 [[Richard Altmann]] created the term nucleic acid – at that time DNA and RNA were not differentiated.<ref name="nuclein">{{cite web |title=BIOdotEDU |url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/LAD/C4/C4_Components.html |website=www.brooklyn.cuny.edu |access-date=1 January 2022}}</ref>
In 1938 [[William Astbury|Astbury]] and Bell published the first X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Michael|last2=Nelson|first2=David | name-list-style = vanc |title=Principles of Biochemistry|date=2008|publisher=Susan Winslow|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GUdBQAAQBAJ|isbn=9781464163074}}</ref>

In 1944 the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] showed that DNA is the carrier of genetic information and in 1953 [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|proposed the double-helix structure of DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DNA Structure|url=http://www.whatisdna.net/dna-structure/|website=What is DNA|publisher=Linda Clarks|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>

Experimental studies of nucleic acids constitute a major part of modern [[biological research|biological]] and [[medical research]], and form a foundation for [[genomics|genome]] and [[forensic science]], and the [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical industries]].<ref name="IHGSC">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, etal | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860–921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/pdf/409860a0.pdf | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..860L | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Venter">{{cite journal | vauthors = Venter JC, Adams MD, Myers EW, Li PW, Mural RJ, Sutton GG, etal | title = The sequence of the human genome | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5507 | pages = 1304–51 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11181995 | doi = 10.1126/science.1058040 | bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V | doi-access =  }}</ref><ref name="Budowle">{{cite journal | vauthors = Budowle B, van Daal A | title = Extracting evidence from forensic DNA analyses: future molecular biology directions | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 339–40, 342–50 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19480629 | doi = 10.2144/000113136 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Occurrence and nomenclature==
The term ''nucleic acid'' is the overall name for DNA and RNA, members of a family of [[biopolymer]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elson D | journal = [[Annual Review of Biochemistry]] | volume = 34 | pages = 449–86 | year = 1965 | pmid = 14321176 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.34.070165.002313 | title = Metabolism of Nucleic Acids (Macromolecular DNA and RNA) }}</ref> and is synonymous with ''[[polynucleotide]]''. Nucleic acids were named for their initial discovery within the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and for the presence of phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahm R | title = Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–81 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17901982 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-007-0433-0 | publisher = nih.gov | s2cid = 915930 }}</ref> Although first discovered within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, nucleic acids are now known to be found in all life forms including within [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s, and [[virus]]es (There is debate as to [[Life#"At the edge of life": viruses|whether viruses are living or non-living]]). All living cells contain both DNA and RNA (except some cells such as mature red blood cells), while viruses contain either DNA or RNA, but usually not both.<ref name="Brock, Thomas D.; Madigan, Michael T. 2009">{{cite book | vauthors = Brock TD, Madigan MT |title=Brock biology of microorganisms |publisher=Pearson / Benjamin Cummings |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-321-53615-0 }}</ref>
The basic component of biological nucleic acids is the [[nucleotide]], each of which contains a [[Pentose|pentose sugar]] ([[ribose]] or [[deoxyribose]]), a [[phosphate]] group, and a [[nucleobase]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/ec_tutorials/tutorial84.pdf |title= Knowing Nucleic Acids |author= Hardinger, Steven |author2= University of California, Los Angeles |publisher= ucla.edu |year= 2011|author2-link= University of California, Los Angeles }}</ref>
Nucleic acids are also generated within the laboratory, through the use of [[enzyme]]s<ref>Mullis, Kary B. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (Nobel Lecture). 1993. (retrieved December 1, 2010) http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-lecture.html</ref> (DNA and RNA polymerases) and by [[solid-phase synthesis|solid-phase chemical synthesis]].

==Molecular composition and size==
Nucleic acids are generally very large molecules. Indeed, DNA molecules are probably the largest individual molecules known. Well-studied biological nucleic acid molecules range in size from 21 nucleotides ([[small interfering RNA]]) to large chromosomes ([[chromosome 1|human chromosome 1]] is a single molecule that contains 247 million [[base pair]]s<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory SG, Barlow KF, McLay KE, Kaul R, Swarbreck D, Dunham A, etal | title = The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1 | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7091 | pages = 315–21 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16710414 | doi = 10.1038/nature04727 | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..315G | doi-access = free }}</ref>).

In most cases, naturally occurring DNA molecules are [[double helix|double-stranded]] and RNA molecules are single-stranded.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Todorov TI, Morris MD | title = Comparison of RNA, single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA behavior during capillary electrophoresis in semidilute polymer solutions | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 23 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 1033–44 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11981850 | doi = 10.1002/1522-2683(200204)23:7/8<1033::AID-ELPS1033>3.0.CO;2-7 | publisher = nih.gov | others = [[National Institutes of Health]] | s2cid = 33167686 }}</ref> There are numerous exceptions, however—some viruses have genomes made of [[Reoviridae|double-stranded RNA]] and other viruses have [[M13 bacteriophage|single-stranded DNA]] genomes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mhunt/rna-ho.htm |title= RN Virus Replication Strategies |author= Margaret Hunt |author2= University of South Carolina |publisher= sc.edu |year= 2010|author2-link= University of South Carolina }}</ref> and, in some circumstances, nucleic acid structures with [[triple-stranded DNA|three]] or [[G-quadruplex|four]] strands can form.<ref name="pmid10454599">{{cite journal | vauthors = McGlynn P, Lloyd RG | title = RecG helicase activity at three- and four-strand DNA structures | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 27 | issue = 15 | pages = 3049–56 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10454599 | pmc = 148529 | doi = 10.1093/nar/27.15.3049}}</ref>

Nucleic acids are linear [[polymer]]s (chains) of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a [[purine]] or [[pyrimidine]] [[nucleobase]] (sometimes termed ''nitrogenous base'' or simply ''base''), a [[pentose]] [[sugar]], and a [[phosphate]] group which makes the molecule acidic. The substructure consisting of a nucleobase plus sugar is termed a [[nucleoside]]. Nucleic acid types differ in the structure of the sugar in their nucleotides–DNA contains 2'-[[deoxyribose]] while RNA contains [[ribose]] (where the only difference is the presence of a [[hydroxyl group]]). Also, the nucleobases found in the two nucleic acid types are different: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]] are found in both RNA and DNA, while [[thymine]] occurs in DNA and [[uracil]] occurs in RNA.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

The sugars and phosphates in nucleic acids are connected to each other in an alternating chain (sugar-phosphate backbone) through [[phosphodiester]] linkages.<ref name="Stryer">{{cite book |author1=Stryer, Lubert |author2=Berg, Jeremy Mark |author3=Tymoczko, John L. |title=Biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7167-6766-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/biochemistry0006berg }}</ref> In [[nucleic acid nomenclature|conventional nomenclature]], the carbons to which the phosphate groups attach are the 3'-end and the 5'-end carbons of the sugar. This gives nucleic acids [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]], and the ends of nucleic acid molecules are referred to as 5'-end and 3'-end. The nucleobases are joined to the sugars via an ''N''-glycosidic linkage involving a nucleobase ring nitrogen (''N''-1 for pyrimidines and ''N''-9 for purines) and the 1' carbon of the pentose sugar ring.

Non-standard nucleosides are also found in both RNA and DNA and usually arise from modification of the standard nucleosides within the DNA molecule or the primary (initial) RNA transcript. [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecules contain a particularly large number of modified nucleosides.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rich A, RajBhandary UL | title = Transfer RNA: molecular structure, sequence, and properties | journal = [[Annual Review of Biochemistry]] | volume = 45 | pages = 805–60 | year = 1976 | pmid = 60910 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.45.070176.004105 }}</ref>

==Topology==
Double-stranded nucleic acids are made up of complementary sequences, in which extensive [[base pair|Watson-Crick base pairing]] results in a highly repeated and quite uniform nucleic acid [[double helix|double-helical]] three-dimensional structure.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Watson JD, Crick FH |title = Molecular structure of nucleic acids; a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid |journal = Nature |volume = 171 |issue = 4356 |pages = 737–8 |date = April 1953 |pmid = 13054692 |doi = 10.1038/171737a0 |bibcode = 1953Natur.171..737W |s2cid = 4253007 }}</ref> In contrast, single-stranded RNA and DNA molecules are not constrained to a regular double helix, and can adopt [[nucleic acid tertiary structure|highly complex three-dimensional structures]] that are based on short stretches of intramolecular base-paired sequences including both Watson-Crick and noncanonical base pairs, and a wide range of complex tertiary interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Ferré-D'Amaré AR, Doudna JA |title = RNA folds: insights from recent crystal structures |journal = [[Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure]] |volume=28 |pages=57–73 |year=1999 |pmid=10410795 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.28.1.57 }}</ref>

Nucleic acid molecules are usually unbranched and may occur as linear and circular molecules. For example, bacterial chromosomes, [[plasmid]]s, [[mitochondrial DNA]], and chloroplast DNA are usually circular double-stranded DNA molecules, while chromosomes of the eukaryotic nucleus are usually linear double-stranded DNA molecules.<ref name="Brock, Thomas D.; Madigan, Michael T. 2009"/> Most RNA molecules are linear, single-stranded molecules, but both circular and branched molecules can result from [[RNA splicing]] reactions.<ref name="Alberts">{{cite book |author=Alberts, Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8153-4105-5 }}</ref> The total amount of pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is equal to the total amount of purines. The diameter of the helix is about 20 [[angstrom|Å]].

==Sequences==
{{main|Nucleic acid sequence}}
{{further|Genetics}}

One DNA or RNA molecule differs from another primarily in the [[nucleic acid sequence|sequence of nucleotides]]. Nucleotide sequences are of great importance in biology since they carry the ultimate instructions that encode all biological molecules, molecular assemblies, subcellular and cellular structures, organs, and organisms, and directly enable cognition, memory, and behavior. Enormous efforts have gone into the development of experimental methods to determine the nucleotide sequence of biological DNA and RNA molecules,<ref>Gilbert, Walter G. 1980. DNA Sequencing and Gene Structure (Nobel Lecture) http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/gilbert-lecture.html</ref><ref>Sanger, Frederick. 1980. Determination of Nucleotide Sequences in DNA (Nobel Lecture) http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1980/sanger-lecture.html</ref> and today hundreds of millions of nucleotides are [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] daily at genome centers and smaller laboratories worldwide. In addition to maintaining the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database, the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the NCBI web site.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = Database issue | pages = D7-17 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24259429 | pmc = 3965057 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1146 | author1 = NCBI Resource Coordinators }}</ref>

==Types==

===Deoxyribonucleic acid===
{{main|DNA}}
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid containing the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms. The chemical DNA was discovered in 1869, but its role in genetic inheritance was not demonstrated until 1943. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes. Other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.
DNA consists of two long polymers of [[monomer]] units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands are oriented in opposite directions to each other and are, therefore, [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. This information specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins according to the [[genetic code]]. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription.
Within cells, DNA is organized into long sequences called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

=== Ribonucleic acid ===
{{main|RNA}}
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) functions in converting genetic information from genes into the amino acid sequences of proteins. The three universal types of RNA include transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). [[Messenger RNA]] acts to carry genetic sequence information between DNA and ribosomes, directing protein synthesis and carries instructions from DNA in the nucleus to ribosome . [[Ribosomal RNA]] reads the DNA sequence, and catalyzes peptide bond formation. [[Transfer RNA]] serves as the carrier molecule for amino acids to be used in protein synthesis, and is responsible for decoding the mRNA. In addition, many other [[non-coding RNA|classes of RNA]] are now known.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

===Artificial nucleic acid===
{{main|Nucleic acid analogue}}
Artificial [[nucleic acid analogue]]s have been designed and synthesized.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma S, Eckstein F | title = Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users | journal = [[Annual Review of Biochemistry]] | volume = 67 | pages = 99–134 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99 | doi-access = free }}</ref> They include [[peptide nucleic acid]], [[morpholino]]- and [[locked nucleic acid]], [[glycol nucleic acid]], and [[threose nucleic acid]]. Each of these is distinguished from naturally occurring DNA or RNA by changes to the backbone of the molecules.{{cn|date=April 2023}}
