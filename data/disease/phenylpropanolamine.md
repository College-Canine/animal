PPA, structurally, is in the [[substituted phenethylamine]] class, consisting of a cyclic benzene or phenyl group, a two carbon ethyl moiety, and a terminal nitrogen, hence the name ''phen-ethyl-amine''.<ref name="Westfall2" /> The methyl group on the [[alpha carbon]] (the first carbon before the nitrogen group) also makes this compound a member of the [[substituted amphetamine]] class.<ref name="Westfall2" /> [[Ephedrine]] is the ''N''-methyl analogue of PPA.

Exogenous compounds in this family are degraded too rapidly by [[monoamine oxidase]] to be active at all but the highest doses.<ref name="Westfall2" /> However, the addition of the α-methyl group allows the compound to avoid metabolism and confer an effect.<ref name="Westfall2" /> In general, ''N''-methylation of primary amines increases their potency, whereas β-hydroxylation decreases CNS activity, but conveys more selectivity for [[adrenergic]] receptors.<ref name="Westfall2">{{cite book | veditors = Brunton LL, Chabner BA, Knollmann BC | title = Goodman & Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics | year = 2010 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 9780071624428 | vauthors = Westfall DP, Westfall TC | chapter = Chapter 12: Adrenergic Agonists and Antagonists: CLASSIFICATION OF SYMPATHOMIMETIC DRUGS | edition = 12th | quote = CHEMISTRY AND STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP OF SYMPATHOMIMETIC AMINES<br />β-Phenylethylamine (Table 12–1) can be viewed as the parent compound of the sympathomimetic amines, consisting of a benzene ring and an ethylamine side chain. The structure permits substitutions to be made on the aromatic ring, the α- and β-carbon atoms, and the terminal amino group to yield a variety of compounds with sympathomimetic activity.&nbsp;...N-methylation increases the potency of primary amines&nbsp;...<br />Substitution on the α-Carbon Atom<br />This substitution blocks oxidation by MAO, greatly prolonging the duration of action of non-catecholamines because their degradation depends largely on the action of this enzyme. The duration of action of drugs such as ephedrine or amphetamine is thus measured in hours rather than in minutes. Similarly, compounds with an α-methyl substituent persist in the nerve terminals and are more likely to release NE from storage sites. Agents such as metaraminol exhibit a greater degree of indirect sympathomimetic activity.<br />Substitution on the β-Carbon Atom<br />Substitution of a hydroxyl group on the β carbon generally decreases actions within the CNS, largely because it lowers lipid solubility. However, such substitution greatly enhances agonist activity at both α- and β- adrenergic receptors. Although ephedrine is less potent than methamphetamine as a central stimulant, it is more powerful in dilating bronchioles and increasing blood pressure and heart rate.}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
=== Mechanism of action ===

Although originally thought to act as a direct [[agonist]] of [[adrenergic receptor]]s, PPA was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for these [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, and has been instead characterized as an indirect [[Sympathomimetic drug|sympathomimetic]]<ref name="MortonHall2012" /> which acts by [[norepinephrine releasing agent|inducing norepinephrine release]] and thereby activating adrenergic receptors.<ref name="pmid12954796">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothman RB, Vu N, Partilla JS, Roth BL, Hufeisen SJ, Compton-Toth BA, Birkes J, Young R, Glennon RA | display-authors = 6 | title = In vitro characterization of ephedrine-related stereoisomers at biogenic amine transporters and the receptorome reveals selective actions as norepinephrine transporter substrates | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 307 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–145 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 12954796 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.103.053975 | s2cid = 19015584 | author4-link = Bryan Roth }}</ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===
PPA acts primarily as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[norepinephrine releasing agent]].<ref name="pmid12954796" /> It also acts as a [[dopamine releasing agent]] with around 10-fold lower [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]].<ref name="pmid12954796" /> The stereoisomers of the drug have only weak or negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for [[α-adrenergic receptor|α-]] and [[β-adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid12954796" />

Many sympathetic hormones and neurotransmitters are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and function generally in "fight or flight" type responses, such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, dilating the pupils, increased energy, drying of mucous membranes, increased sweating, and a significant number of additional effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Drug interactions==
Certain drugs increase the chances of ''[[déjà vu]]'' occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of ''déjà vu''. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taiminen T, Jääskeläinen SK | title = Intense and recurrent déjà vu experiences related to amantadine and phenylpropanolamine in a healthy male | journal = Journal of Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 460–462 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11535020 | doi = 10.1054/jocn.2000.0810 | s2cid = 6733989 }}</ref> reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of ''déjà vu'' upon taking the drugs [[amantadine]] and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the [[dopaminergic]] action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bancaud J, Brunet-Bourgin F, Chauvel P, Halgren E | title = Anatomical origin of déjà vu and vivid 'memories' in human temporal lobe epilepsy | journal = Brain | volume = 117 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 71–90 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8149215 | doi = 10.1093/brain/117.1.71 }}</ref> Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that ''déjà vu'' occurs as a result of [[Mesial_temporal_lobe_epilepsy|hyperdopaminergic action]] in the [[mesial]] [[Temporal_lobe|temporal]] areas of the brain.

==Legal status==
In Sweden, PPA is still available in prescription decongestants;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=19790406000053&DocTypeID=3&UserTypeID=0 |title=Rinexin in Farmaceutiska Specialiteter i Sverige |trans-title="Rinexin" from the Pharmaceutical Specialties of Sweden |type=drug catalog |language=sv |access-date=7 January 2014}}</ref> PPA is also still available in Germany. It is used in some [[polypill]] medications like Wick DayMed capsules.

In the [[United Kingdom]], PPA was available in many "all in one" cough and cold medications which usually also feature [[paracetamol]] or another [[analgesic]] and [[caffeine]] and could also be purchased on its own; however, it is no longer approved for human use. A European Category 1 Licence is required to purchase PPA for academic use.

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a public health advisory<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm052239.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126085450/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm052239.htm |archive-date=26 January 2010 |title=Phenylpopanolamine Advisory |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=6 November 2000}}</ref> against the use of the drug in November 2000. In this advisory, the FDA requested but did not require that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing PPA. The agency estimates that PPA caused between 200 and 500 strokes per year among 18-to-49-year-old users. In 2005, the FDA removed PPA from over-the-counter sale and removed its "generally recognized as safe and effective" (GRASE) status.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/ppa/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112142816/https://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/ppa/ |archive-date=12 January 2009 |title=Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Information Page – FDA moves PPA from OTC |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=23 December 2005}}</ref> Under the 2020 [[CARES Act]], it requires FDA approval before it can be marketed again effectively banning the drug even as a prescription drug.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/over-counter-otc-nonprescription-drugs/over-counter-otc-drug-review-otc-monograph-reform-cares-act Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review | OTC Monograph Reform in the CARES Act]</ref>

Because of its potential use in [[amphetamine]] manufacture, phenylpropanolamine is controlled by the [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]]. It is still available for veterinary use in dogs, however, as a treatment for [[urinary incontinence]].

Internationally, an item on the agenda of the 2000 [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] session called for including the stereoisomer norephedrine in Table I of [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/document_1999-12-21_1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030814040706/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/document_1999-12-21_1.html |archive-date=14 August 2003 |title=Implementation of the international drug control treaties: changes in the scope of control of substances |publisher=Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Forty-third session |location=Vienna |date=6–15 March 2000}}</ref>
