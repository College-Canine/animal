The '''Australian Shepherd''' is a [[breed]] of [[herding dog]] from the [[United States]]. The name of the breed is technically a [[misnomer]], as it was developed in [[California]] in the 19th century. It is believed to have its origins in [[sheepdog]] breeds from northwest [[Spain]], as well as [[collie]]s imported, alongside sheep, from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; the breed reportedly took its name from this trade. Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog breeds in North America.

==History==
[[File:Australian Shepherd Black Tri, Red Tri, Blue Merle.jpg|thumb|Three Australian Shepherds]]
The Australian Shepherd descends in part from pastoral dogs brought to herd Spanish flocks in North America as early as the 1500s.<ref name="australianshepherds" /> There is some speculation that these dogs included the [[Carea Leonés]], a mountain sheepdog that can display the eye color and merle coat found in many contemporary Australian Shepherds.<ref name="australianshepherds">{{cite web |title=Australian Shepherd History |url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd-history-behind-breed/ |website=American Kennel Club |publisher=AKC |access-date=20 August 2021 |archive-date=19 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519162721/https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd-history-behind-breed/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It is sometimes claimed that the [[Basque Shepherd Dog]] and the [[Pyrenean Sheepdog]] were also among the ancestors of the breed.{{r|Alderton|Morris}} The breed as it is known today developed in [[California]] in the 19th century, as a [[Herding dog|sheep herding]] dog for Californian shepherds.{{r|Alderton|Fogle|Morris}} The Australian Shepherd is also believed to be descended from a variety of herding dogs imported to California with imported sheep, including [[collie]]s from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It was from these ancestors that the breed took its name.{{r|Fogle|Morris}}

The Australian Shepherd spread from California throughout the Western United States where it became extremely popular with ranchers who valued the breed’s sheep working qualities, as well as their ability to handle cattle and other livestock.{{r|Morris}} A purely working breed for over a century, the Australian Shepherd was virtually unknown outside of the livestock industry until the mid-20th century when the breed was popularised by Jay Lister, a rodeo performer, at rodeos across the western states with his Australian Shepherds performing all manner of tricks.{{r|Palika}} A breed club was soon formed to promote the breed, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, and [[kennel club]] recognition followed in 1979 when the breed was recognised by the [[United Kennel Club]].{{r|Morris|UKC}} The breed was subsequently recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]] in the 1990s and later the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]].{{r|Alderton|Morris}}

From the late-20th century the Australian Shepherd has increasingly been seen in [[conformation show]]s and it has become an extremely popular [[companion dog]]. In 2019 it was ranked by the American Kennel Club as the 15th most popular breed of dog in the United States.{{r|Morris}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/ |title=Most popular dog breeds – full ranking list |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 March 2019 |website=[[American Kennel Club]] |access-date=5 April 2021 |archive-date=28 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228202011/https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Description==
===Appearance===
[[File:Bvdb-australischeherder.jpg|thumb|right|Variations of Australian Shepherd colors]]
The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized, athletic breed; they typically stand between {{convert|18|and|23|in|cm}} and weigh between {{convert|35|and|70|lb|kg}}.{{r|Alderton|Fogle}} The parent club, the Australian Shepherd Club of America’s [[breed standard]] states male dogs should stand between {{convert|20|and|23|in|cm}} and females between {{convert|18|and|21|in|cm}}, at the withers; the standard does allow individual animals to exceed these limits slightly.

The Australian Shepherd has a moderately long and wavy double coat that has a dense undercoat and coarse topcoat; the coat is short on the face and well feathered on the rear of the legs.{{r|Fogle|Morris}} The breed is known for its unique colorations and variable coat patterns, it being said no two dogs sharing a coat.{{r|Morris}} The breed standard allows for blue [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]], red merle, solid black or solid red, with or without white markings and with or without tan points.{{r|UKC}}

Examples of the breed can be born with long or [[Natural bobtail#Dogs|naturally bobbed (short) tails]];<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hytönen |first1=Marjo K |last2=Grall |first2=Anaïs |last3=Hédan |first3=Benoît |date=2009-03-01 |title=Ancestral T-Box Mutation Is Present in Many, but Not All, Short-Tailed Dog Breeds |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=236–240 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esn085 |pmid=18854372 |via=academic.com}}</ref> traditionally long tailed dogs had their tails [[Docking (dog)|docked]], although some countries outside of the United States do not allow docking and so some long tailed and partial bob tails are allowed to be exhibited in those countries.

===Temperament===
The Australian Shepherd is described as intelligent, active, loyal, protective, playful, and adaptive.{{r|Alderton|Fogle|Morris}} The modern breed is predominantly bred for pets; despite this, many retain a strong herding instinct and it is not uncommon for companion dogs of the breed to try to herd children or other pets.{{r|Alderton|Palika}} A very active breed, the Australian Shepherd is known to become destructive if it does not receive adequate exercise.{{r|Alderton|Palika}}

==Health==
Australian Shepherds are generally a healthy breed, but they can have several health problems. Vision problems are common,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asca.org/hereditarydefects |title=Hereditary Defects of the Australian Shepherd |publisher=Australian Shepherd Club of America, Inc. |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403063442/http://www.asca.org/hereditarydefects |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[epilepsy]] is also a concern. Australian Shepherds can develop hip problems. In merle-to-merle breeding, the puppies that have inherited two copies of the merle gene have an increased risk of being born blind or deaf.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asca.org/advancedarticles/canineepilepsy |title=Canine Epilepsy |publisher=Australian Shepherd Club of America, Inc. |year=1999 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430022150/http://www.asca.org/advancedarticles/canineepilepsy |url-status=live }}</ref>

A 2024 UK study found a median life expectancy of 13.7 years based on a sample of 62 deaths, which was above the median of 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for [[Mongrel|crossbreeds]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=McMillan | first=Kirsten M. | last2=Bielby | first2=Jon | last3=Williams | first3=Carys L. | last4=Upjohn | first4=Melissa M. | last5=Casey | first5=Rachel A. | last6=Christley | first6=Robert M. | title=Longevity of companion dog breeds: those at risk from early death | journal=Scientific Reports | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=14 | issue=1 | date=2024-02-01 | issn=2045-2322 | doi=10.1038/s41598-023-50458-w | page=| pmc=10834484 }}</ref>

===Morbidity ===
Based on a sample of 48 still-living dogs, the most common health concerns noted by owners were eye problems (red eye, epiphora, conjunctivitis, and cataracts).<ref name="KC Survey">[http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813043548/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 |date=2013-08-13 }}. 2004. Purebred Dog Health Survey. Retrieved July 5, 2007</ref>  Dermatological and respiratory problems also ranked high.

[[Collie eye anomaly]] (CEA) is rare in the breed, but it and [[cataracts]] are a concern in Australian Shepherds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) |url=http://www.asca.org/education/health/collieeyeanolomy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716084319/http://www.asca.org/education/health/collieeyeanolomy |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |publisher=Australian Shepherd Club of America, Inc.}}</ref> Other conditions of note include iris coloboma, [[canine hip dysplasia]], Pelger-Huet anomaly, [[hypothyroidism]], and nasal solar dermatitis. Prior to breeding, the Australian Shepherd should be checked for hip and elbow dysplasia and DNA tests performed to show the dog to be free of the MDR1 mutation, cataract mutation, and CEA. Tests should also include those for thyroidism and clearances for other known eye diseases like colobomas, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal folds.

Some Australian Shepherds (as well as [[Collie]]s, [[German Shepherd]]s, and many other herding dogs) are susceptible to a genetic mutation of the ''MDR1'' gene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashgi.org/articles/mdr1.htm |title=MDR1 FAQs |publisher=Australian Shepherd Health & Genetics Institute, Inc. |access-date=April 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213125320/http://www.ashgi.org/articles/mdr1.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> Dogs with the mutation can suffer toxicity from antiparasitics such as ivermectin in high doses, and other drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL/drugs.aspx |title=Problem Drugs |publisher=Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine |date=December 8, 2010 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201714/http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL/drugs.aspx |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>  A test is available to determine if a particular dog carries the mutated gene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL/test.aspx |title=Get Your Dog Tested |publisher=Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine |date=January 19, 2011 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429162752/http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL/test.aspx |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Australian Shepherds show relatively low levels (approximately 6%) of hip dysplasia, a heritable condition where the femur does not fit securely in the pelvic socket of the hip joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Loder |first1=Randall T. |last2=Todhunter |first2=Rory J. |date=2017-03-12 |title=The Demographics of Canine Hip Dysplasia in the United States and Canada |journal=Journal of Veterinary Medicine |language=en |volume=2017 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1155/2017/5723476 |doi-access=free |issn=2356-7708 |pmc=5366211 |pmid=28386583}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2084&aid=444|title=Hip Dysplasia in Dogs: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention|website=www.peteducation.com|access-date=2016-05-12|archive-date=2016-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329203734/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?aid=444&c=2+2084|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Double merle===
[[File:Eyes of a lethal white Australian Shepherd.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an abnormal eye of a double merle, "lethal white", Australian Shepherd: The abnormally small left eye is known as [[microphthalmia]], and the pupil shows signs of [[subluxation]] which is dropped, not centered.]]
Double merle or [[homozygous]] merle occurs when the offspring of two merled parents inherit two copies of the dominant merle gene. The odds of this are 25% for each pup born from such a litter.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.asca.org/advancedarticles/whitedeafness |title=White-linked Deafness in Australian Shepherds |publisher=Australian Shepherd Club of America, Inc. |year=1998 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-date=January 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108170655/http://www.asca.org/advancedarticles/whitedeafness |url-status=live }}</ref> Double merles often have excessive light or white areas and can have hearing and vision problems as a result of having two copies of the merle gene.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Australian Shepherd Bible and the Australian Shepherd : Your Perfect Australian Shepherd Guide Covers Australian Shepherds, Australian Shepherd Puppies, Australian Shepherd Training, Mini Australian Shepherds, Australian Shepherd Breeders, Size, Health, More!|last=Mark.|first=Manfield|isbn=9781911355564|location=Milano|oclc=1005140424|date = 2017-05-13}}</ref> Homozygous merles can be deaf or blind, or express iris [[coloboma]]s, [[retinal detachment]], [[cataract]]s, [[persistent pupillary membrane]], a displacement of the lens, equatorial [[staphyloma]], [[night blindness]] and [[microphthalmia]]. Audio impairment or deafness usually develops after the birth of a puppy with their ear canal still closed. The white color of double merles is produced due to the lack of [[melanocyte]]s which provide high [[potassium]] levels in the [[endolymph]] surrounding the cochlea's hair cells. There is no surgery or treatment that can reduce the damage. Loss of hearing is directly linked to the amount of pigmentation cells a dog has. The same pigment that is lacking in the ear can also be lacking in the eyes, affecting its development. Although many believe that only dogs with blue eyes have eye problems, it is not correct. Due to the contrast between eye problems and blue eyes, eye conditions in blue-eyed dogs are much easier to spot.<ref name=":0" />

Not all homozygous merles are affected, but most are, making the breeding of two merles a very touchy subject. Some breeders euthanize mostly white pups, while others may attempt to sell them as "rare" white Australian Shepherds without disclosing the potential for health defects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashgi.org/home-page/genetics-info/coat-color/whats-wrong-with-white-aussies|title=What's Wrong With White Aussies?|access-date=24 April 2014|archive-date=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426202146/http://www.ashgi.org/home-page/genetics-info/coat-color/whats-wrong-with-white-aussies|url-status=live}}</ref> A large percentage of homozygous merles sold eventually end up in rescue and shelters, as the average family is ill-prepared to take on a deaf or blind pet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

The term "lethal white" originated from horses born with [[lethal white syndrome]], and has since evolved to often describe dogs born with the double merle trait. This trait is found in many breeds, but most commonly found in Australian Shepherds. The name "lethal white" is a [[misnomer]], as this genetic condition is not lethal to the dogs; it is often the breeder who is lethal to the pups by [[cull]]ing them immediately after birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-shepherd-lovers.com/lethal-white.html|title=Homozygous "Lethal White" Merles|access-date=13 January 2013|archive-date=2 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102104804/http://www.australian-shepherd-lovers.com/lethal-white.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Many consider the term "lethal white" to be derogatory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lethalwhites.com/brochure/WhtAusBro.pdf|title=What is a double merle?|access-date=13 January 2013|archive-date=25 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225003603/http://www.lethalwhites.com/brochure/WhtAusBro.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Activities==
Like other [[herding breed]]s, these dogs excel at many [[dog sports]], especially [[herding]] also known as [[Stock dog|stockdog]], [[dog agility]], [[Dock jumping|dock diving/dock jumping]], [[Obedience trial|obedience]], [[Rally obedience|rally]], [[Tracking (dog)|tracking]], [[disc dog|disc]], and [[flyball]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-09|title=Competitive Programs {{!}} ASCA|url=https://www.asca.org/competitive-programs/,%20https://www.asca.org/competitive-programs/|access-date=2021-10-15|website=www.asca.org|language=en-US}}</ref> Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive instinct tests.

The dog has a stride in which its front and back legs cross over, making for an appearance of "on the edge" speed. The dogs instinctively use a "pounce" position to deal with cattle trying to kick them. They also have strong hips and legs, allowing for fast acceleration and high jumping, sometimes as high as 4&nbsp;ft (1.3 m).{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

An Australian shepherd named Pockets is credited as being the oldest dog to earn a title in AKC history, having earned the Rally Novice title at the age of 15 years, 5 weeks.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Sally |url=http://mnsun.com/articles/2005/10/13/news/aw13aussie.txt |title=Plymouth dog sets American Kennel Club record |newspaper=Minnesota Local News |publisher=Sun Newspapers |date=November 10, 2005 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420062724/http://mnsun.com/articles/2005/10/13/news/aw13aussie.txt |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
