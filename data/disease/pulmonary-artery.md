A '''pulmonary artery''' is an [[artery]] in the [[pulmonary circulation]] that carries deoxygenated [[blood]] from the right side of the [[heart]] to the [[lung]]s. The largest pulmonary artery is the ''main pulmonary artery'' or ''pulmonary trunk''  from the [[heart]], and the smallest ones are the [[arteriole]]s, which lead to the [[Capillary|capillaries]] that surround the [[Pulmonary alveolus|pulmonary alveoli]].

== Structure ==
The pulmonary arteries are [[blood vessel]]s that carry [[Circulatory system|systemic venous blood]] from the right ventricle of the heart to the [[capillary|microcirculation]] of the lungs. Unlike in other organs where arteries supply oxygenated blood, the blood carried by the pulmonary arteries is deoxygenated, as it is venous blood returning to the heart. The main pulmonary arteries emerge from the right side of the heart and then split into smaller arteries that progressively divide and become [[arteriole]]s, eventually narrowing into the capillary microcirculation of the lungs where gas exchange occurs.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

In order of blood flow, the pulmonary arteries start as the '''pulmonary trunk''' that leaves the fibrous pericardium ([[pericardium|parietal pericardium]]) of the [[ventricular outflow tract]] of [[right ventricle]] (also known as [[Infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum or conus arteriosus]].<ref name="Ryan 2011"/> The outflow track runs superiorly and to the left, posterior to the [[pulmonary valve]].<ref name="Ryan 2011"/> The pulmonary trunk bifurcates into right and left pulmonary arteries below the [[arch of aorta]] and in front of the left main bronchus.<ref name="Ryan 2011">{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=Stephanie |title=Anatomy for diagnostic imaging |date=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Ltd. |isbn=9780702029714 |pages=126, 133|edition=Third |chapter=2}}</ref> Pulmonary trunk is short and wide{{snd}}approximately {{convert|5|cm|in}} in length<ref name="Chatterjee 2011"/> and {{convert|2|cm|in}}-{{convert|3|cm|in}} in diameter.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=P D |last2=Bull |first2=R K |last3=Coulden |first3=R |date=1998-10-01 |title=CT measurement of main pulmonary artery diameter. |url=https://www.birpublications.org/doi/abs/10.1259/bjr.71.850.10211060 |journal=The British Journal of Radiology |volume=71 |issue=850 |pages=1018–1020 |doi=10.1259/bjr.71.850.10211060 |pmid=10211060 |issn=0007-1285}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Truong |first1=Quynh A. |last2=Massaro |first2=Joseph M. |last3=Rogers |first3=Ian S. |last4=Mahabadi |first4=Amir A. |last5=Kriegel |first5=Matthias F. |last6=Fox |first6=Caroline S. |last7=O'Donnell |first7=Christopher J. |last8=Hoffmann |first8=Udo |date=2012-01-01 |title=Reference Values for Normal Pulmonary Artery Dimensions by Noncontrast Cardiac Computed Tomography |journal=Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=147–154 |doi=10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.111.968610 |pmc=3275437 |pmid=22178898}}</ref>

===Branches===
[[File:Alveolus diagram.svg|thumb|At the far end, pulmonary arteries (labelled at the bottom) become capillaries at the [[Pulmonary alveolus|pulmonary alveoli]].]]

The left main pulmonary artery then divides into two lobar arteries, one for each lobe of the left lung.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kandathil |first1=Asha |last2=Chamarthy |first2=Murthy |date=June 2018 |title=Pulmonary vascular anatomy & anatomical variants |journal=Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=201–207 |doi=10.21037/cdt.2018.01.04 |issn=2223-3652 |pmc=6039811 |pmid=30057869 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

At the right [[root of the lung]], it bifurcates into artery that supplies the right upper lobe of the lung, in front of the right upper lobe bronchus, and interlobar artery that supplies the right middle and inferior lobes of the lung, running together with bronchus intermedius.<ref name="Ryan 2011"/>

The right and left main pulmonary (lungs) arteries give off branches that supplies the corresponding [[lung lobe]]s. In such cases it is termed '''lobar arteries'''.<ref name="virginia 2013"/> The lobar arteries branch into '''segmental arteries''' (roughly 1 for each segment).

==Development==
The pulmonary arteries originate from the [[truncus arteriosus]] and the sixth [[pharyngeal arch]]. The truncus arteriosus is a structure that forms during the [[Heart development|development of the heart]] as a successor to the [[conus arteriosus]].<ref name="Larsen_2009">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/larsenshumanembr0000unse |title=Larsen's human embryology |vauthors=Schoenwolf GC, Larsen MJ, Bleyl SR, Brauer PR, Francis-West PH |date=2009 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |isbn=9780443068119 |edition=4th ed., Thoroughly rev. and updated. |location=Philadelphia |pages=Development of the Urogenital system |url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|157}}

By the third week of [[human embryogenesis|development]], the [[endocardial tubes]] have developed a swelling in the part closest to the heart. The swelling is known as the [[bulbus cordis]] and the upper part of this swelling develops into the [[truncus arteriosus]].<ref name = "Larsen_2009" />{{rp|159–160}} The structure is ultimately mesodermal in origin.<ref name = "Larsen_2009" />{{rp|157}} During [[Heart development|development of the heart]], the heart tissues undergo folding, and the truncus arteriosus is exposed to what will eventually be both the left and right ventricles. As a [[septum]] develops between the two ventricles of the heart, two bulges form on either side of the truncus arteriosus. These progressively enlarge until the trunk splits into the [[aorta]] and pulmonary arteries.<ref name = "Larsen_2009" />{{rp|176–179}}

During [[prenatal development|early development]], the [[ductus arteriosus]] connects the pulmonary trunk and the [[aortic arch]], allowing blood to bypass the lungs.<ref name = "Braunwald_1992">{{cite book|title = Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine| vauthors = Braunwald E |edition = Fourth | date = 1992 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = W.B.

==Clinical significance==
The pulmonary artery is relevant in a number of clinical states. [[Pulmonary hypertension]] is used to describe an increase in the pressure of the pulmonary artery, and may be defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 25 mmHg.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|720}} A pulmonary artery diameter of more than 29&nbsp;mm (measured on a [[CT scan]]) is often used as an indicator for pulmonary hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marini TJ, He K, Hobbs SK, Kaproth-Joslin K | title = Pictorial review of the pulmonary vasculature: from arteries to veins | journal = Insights into Imaging | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 971–987 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30382495 | pmc = 6269336 | doi = 10.1007/s13244-018-0659-5 }}</ref> In chest X-rays, a diameter of more than 16&nbsp;mm for the right descending pulmonary artery is also an indicator for pulmonary hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang CH | title = The normal roentgenographic measurement of the right descending pulmonary artery in 1,085 cases and its clinical application.

Pulmonary embolism refers to an embolus that lodges in the pulmonary circulation. This may arise from a [[deep venous thrombosis]], especially after a period of immobility. A pulmonary embolus is a common cause of death in patients with cancer and stroke.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|720–721}} A large pulmonary embolus that becomes lodged in the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk with extensions into both the left and right main pulmonary arteries is called a ''saddle embolus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/saddle-pulmonary-embolism| vauthors = Jones J, etal |title=Saddle pulmonary embolism|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|access-date=2017-10-08}}</ref>

Several animal models have been utilized for investigating pulmonary artery related pathologies. Porcine model of pulmonary artery is the most frequently used and it was recently found that their mechanical properties vary with every subsequent branching.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pillalamarri NR, Patnaik SS, Piskin S, Gueldner P, Finol EA | title = ''Ex Vivo'' Regional Mechanical Characterization of Porcine Pulmonary Arteries | journal = Experimental Mechanics | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 285–303 | date = January 2021 | pmid = 33814554 | pmc = 8011683 | doi = 10.1007/s11340-020-00678-2 }}</ref>
