== Types ==
The terms uterine cancer and womb cancer may refer to several different types of [[cancer]] that occur in the [[uterus]], namely:

=== [[Endometrial cancer]] ===

* ''Endometrial carcinomas'' originate from cells in the glands of the [[endometrium]] (uterine lining). These include the common and readily treatable ''well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma,'' as well as the more aggressive ''[[Uterine serous carcinoma|uterine papillary serous carcinoma]]'' and ''[[uterine clear-cell carcinoma]]''.<ref name="www.cancer.org_2">{{Cite web|title=What Is Endometrial Cancer?|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrial-cancer/about/what-is-endometrial-cancer.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.cancer.org|language=en}}</ref>
* ''[[Mixed Müllerian tumor|Malignant mixed Müllerian tumors]]'' (also known as uterine carcinosarcomas) are rare endometrial tumors which show both glandular ([[carcinoma]]tous) and stromal ([[sarcoma]]tous) differentiation.<ref name="www.cancer.org_2" />

=== [[Uterine sarcoma]]s ===

*[[Leiomyosarcoma|''Leiomyosarcomas'']] originate from the muscular layer of the uterus (or [[myometrium]]). Of note, leiomyosarcomas are distinct from [[Uterine fibroid|uterine leiomyomas]], which are benign tumors of the uterus.<ref name="www.cancer.org_3">{{Cite web|title=What Is Uterine Sarcoma?|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/uterine-sarcoma/about/what-is-uterine-sarcoma.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.cancer.org|language=en}}</ref>
*''[[Endometrial stromal sarcoma]]s'' originate from the [[connective tissue]]s of the [[endometrium]], and are far less common than endometrial carcinomas.<ref name="www.cancer.org_3" />

== Signs and symptoms ==
Both types of uterine cancer can present with abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge.<ref name="www.uptodate.com">{{Cite web|title=Endometrial carcinoma: Clinical features, diagnosis, prognosis, and screening|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-clinical-features-diagnosis-prognosis-and-screening?search=uterine%20cancer&topicRef=16917&source=see_link|access-date=2021-09-18|website=www.uptodate.com}}</ref><ref name="www.uptodate.com_2">{{Cite web|title=Uterine sarcoma: Classification, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-sarcoma-classification-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis?search=uterine%20sarcoma&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~61&usage_type=default&display_rank=1|access-date=2021-09-18|website=www.uptodate.com}}</ref> Abnormalities can include change in duration or amount of menstrual bleeding as well as new bleeding between [[menses]] or after menopause. Sensations of new or increasing pelvic pressure or pain can also indicate tumor growth in the uterus.<ref name="www.uptodate.com_2" /> Any of these findings warrant further workup by a doctor.

== Causes and risk factors ==
<!-- Causes -->
It is not known with certainty what the causes for uterine cancer may be, though hormone imbalance is cited as a risk factor. Estrogen receptors, known to be present on the surfaces of cells of this type of cancer, are thought to interact with the hormone causing increased cell growth, which can then result in cancer. The exact mechanism of how this occurs is not understood.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrialcancer/detailedguide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-what-causes Causes, Risk Factors, and Prevention TOPICS] - Do we know what causes endometrial cancer? - cancer.org - American Cancer Society - Retrieved 5 January 2015.</ref><!-- Risk factors -->

Risk factors for endometrial cancer include [[obesity]], [[metabolic syndrome]], [[type 2 diabetes]], taking pills that contain estrogen without progesterone, a history of [[tamoxifen]] use, late menopause, and certain hereditary conditions ([[Lynch Syndrome|Lynch syndrome]], [[Cowden syndrome]]).<ref name="www.cancer.org" /><ref name="NCI2019PtEndo" /><ref name="www.uptodate.com" /> Risk factors for uterine sarcoma include prior [[radiation therapy]] to the pelvis, a history of tamoxifen use, a history of childhood [[retinoblastoma]], and [[Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma|hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome]].<ref name="NCI2019PtSar" /><ref name="www.uptodate.com_2" />

== Diagnosis ==
To evaluate for uterine cancer, a clinician might perform a [[Pelvic examination|pelvic exam]] to visually inspect internal pelvic organs and to feel the size and position of the uterus and ovaries. A “[[Pap test|pap smear]]” may also be done to brush the sides of the cervix to collect cells for testing and to look at under a microscope. A [[Dilation and curettage|dilatation and curettage]] is often done to collect a sample of uterine lining tissue. An [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasound]] is also often performed to look for tumors.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-06-25|title=Uterine Cancer - Diagnosis|url=https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/uterine-cancer/diagnosis|access-date=2021-09-14|website=Cancer.Net|language=en}}</ref>

== Screening and Prevention ==<!-- Screening -->

Screening for uterine cancers is not recommended except for in women with certain hereditary conditions that increase their risk (Lynch, Cowden, HLRCC).<ref name="www.uptodate.com" /><ref name="www.uptodate.com_2" /> <!-- Prevention -->

In general, [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s and [[Progestogen-only pill|progestin-only pills]] are protective against uterine cancers. Weight loss and/or bariatric surgery reduces the risk for patients with obesity.<ref name="www.uptodate.com" />

== Treatment ==
Treatment of uterine cancer may differ depending on the type of cancer and staging of the tumor.<ref name="www.cancer.gov">{{Cite web|title=Uterine Cancer—Patient Version - National Cancer Institute|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/uterine|access-date=2021-09-13|website=www.cancer.gov|language=en}}</ref> In early stages, minimal invasive surgery is preferred. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filippova OT, Leitao MM | title = The current clinical approach to newly diagnosed uterine cancer | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 581–590 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32531179 | pmc = 7416456 | doi = 10.1080/14737140.2020.1782750 }}</ref>

For endometrial cancer, five main types of treatments are used, including surgery, [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. The most common treatment modality for endometrial cancer is surgery, whereby the uterus is removed via a total [[hysterectomy]].<ref name="www.cancer.gov" /> Hysterectomies may also be accompanied by removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, called a [[Salpingoophorectomy|salpingo-oophorectomy]]. Additionally, hormone therapy which seeks to block the growth of cancer cells may also be used in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Targeted therapy may include [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]], [[mTOR inhibitors]], and [[Signal transduction inhibitor|signal transduction inhibitors]] which all act to target cancer cells specifically.<ref name="www.cancer.gov" /> 

As of 2021, treatment options for uterine sarcoma include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.<ref name="www.cancer.gov" />

== Prognosis ==
[[Prognosis]] varies for the different types of endometrial cancer. Factors that influence prognosis across types of uterine cancer are age at diagnosis, the [[Stage (cancer)|stage]] of the cancer, the [[Cancer grading|grade]] of the cancer, [[histology]], depth of [[Invasion (cancer)|invasion]] into the myometrium, and the presence of spread to nearby [[lymph node]]s or other regions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Uharcek P | title = Prognostic factors in endometrial carcinoma | journal = The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 776–783 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18958927 | doi = 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00796.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Endometrial cancer typically has a good 5-year-survival when diagnosed early.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Survival Rates for Endometrial Cancer|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrial-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.cancer.org|language=en}}</ref> Generally, the prognosis is poorer for uterine sarcomas as compared to endometrial cancers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Survival Rates for Uterine Sarcoma|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/uterine-sarcoma/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.cancer.org|language=en}}</ref>

The rates of incidence and death for uterine cancer differ depending on race. The rate of diagnosis is highest for white females, with 28.1 new cases per 100,000 persons. Black females have a similar incidence with 27.4 new cases per 100,000 persons. Other ethnic groups had lower incidences: Hispanic females had 24.1 new cases per 100,000 persons, Asian/Pacific Islander females had 20.8 new cases per 100,000 persons, and American Indian/Alaska Native females had 19.7 new cases per 100,000 persons. For the death rates of uterine cancer, black females had the highest rates, 8.5 deaths per 100,000 persons. The death rates for the other ethnic groups were dramatically lower. White females had 4.4 deaths per 100,000 persons, Hispanic females had 3.9 deaths per 100,000 persons, American Indian/Alaska Native females had 3.5 deaths per 100,000 persons, and Asian/Pacific Islander females had 3.1 deaths per 100,000 persons.<ref name="SEER2019" />
