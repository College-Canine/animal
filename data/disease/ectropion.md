'''Ectropion''' is a [[medical condition]] in which the lower [[eyelid]] turns outwards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ectropion |url=https://elementsofmorphology.nih.gov/index.cgi?tid=49cad0d3ae6a54ac |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=Elements of Morphology |publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute}}</ref> It is one of the notable aspects of newborns exhibiting congenital [[harlequin-type ichthyosis]], but ectropion can occur due to any weakening of tissue of the lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired [[surgery|surgically]]. Ectropion is also found in [[dog]]s as an inherited, developmental condition.<ref name = Kirk>{{cite book |last= Gelatt |first= Kirk N. |date= 2007 |title= Veterinary Ophthalmology |url= https://archive.org/details/veterinaryophtha0000unse/page/n5/mode/2up?q=ectropion |location= [[Gainesville, Florida]] |publisher= [[Blackwell Publishing]] |page= 378 |isbn= 978-0-7817-6657-9}}</ref>

==Causes==
*Congenital
*Aging
*Scarring
*Mechanical
*Allergic
*[[Facial nerve paralysis|Facial nerve palsy]]
*Anti-cancer treatments such as erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab, which block the function of EGFR (the epidermal growth factor receptor).
==In dogs==
Ectropion in dogs usually involves the lower eyelid. Often the condition has no symptoms, but tearing and [[conjunctivitis]] may be seen. Breeds associated with ectropion include the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], the [[Bloodhound]], the [[Clumber Spaniel]], [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundlands]], and the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]].<ref name= Kirk2>{{cite book |last= Gelatt |first= Kirk N. |date= 2000 |title= Essentials of Veterinary Ophthalmology |url= https://archive.org/details/essentialsofvete0000gela/page/n1/mode/2up?q=ectropion |location= [[Baltimore, Maryland]] |publisher= [[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |page= 55 |isbn= 0-683-30077-6}}</ref> It can also result from [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or nerve damage. Treatment (surgery) is recommended only if there is chronic conjunctivitis or if there is [[cornea]]l damage. A small part of the affected lid is removed and then the lid is sewn back together.<ref name= Kirk2 |page= 57 />
