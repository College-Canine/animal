'''''Trichinella britovi''''' is a [[nematode]] [[parasite]] responsible for a [[zoonosis|zoonotic disease]] called [[trichinellosis]]. Currently, eight species of ''Trichinella'' are known,<ref name="Mowlavi">{{cite journal |last1=Mowlavi |first1=Gholamreza |last2=Marucci |first2=Gianluca |last3=Mobedi |first3=Iraj |last4=Zahabiioon |first4=Farzaneh |last5=Mirjalali |first5=Hamed |last6=Pozio |first6=Edoardo |date=2009 |title=''Trichinella britovi'' in a leopard (''Panthera pardus saxicolor'') in Iran |journal=Veterinary Parasitology |volume=164 |issue=2–4 |pages=350–352 |doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.05.001 |pmid=19497675}}</ref> only three of which cause trichinellosis, and ''Trichinella britovi'' is one of them.<ref name="wildBoar">{{cite journal |last1=Gari-Toussaint |first1=M. |last2=Tieulié |first2=N. |last3=Baldin |first3=J.L |last4=Dupouy-Camet |first4=J. |last5=Delaunay |first5=P. |last6=Fuzibet |first6=J.G. |last7=Fichoux |first7=Y.

Humans represent only a possible [[Host (biology)|host]] and the parasite is exclusively transmitted through consumption of raw or [[Rare Meat]].<ref name="wildBoar" /> In Europe, [[pork]] and [[wild boar]] meat are the main sources for human infection.<ref name="wildBoar" />

Because of mandatory veterinary controls in [[slaughterhouse]]s, large trichinellosis outbreaks due to horse-meat consumption are rare, but cases in hunters and their families after raw or rare wild boar meat consumption are regularly reported, with over 100 cases since 1975.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dupouy-Camet |first1=J. |last2=Ancelle |first2=T. |title=Zoonoses parasitaires transmises par la chair animale en France |language=fr |trans-title=Zoonotic parasites transmitted by animal flesh in France |journal=La Lettre de l'Infectiologue |date=2002 |volume=XVII |issue=5 |pages=143–148 |url=http://www.edimark.fr/Front/frontpost/getfiles/3614.pdf}}</ref>

''T. britovi'' in wild boar is relatively resistant to freezing. In France, meat from naturally infected wild boar meat frozen for three weeks at {{convert|−20|°C|0}} remained infectious, whereas the parasites were not viable after four weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pozio |first1=E. |last2=La Rosa |first2=G. |last3=Mignone |first3=W. |last4=Amati |first4=M. |last5=Ercolini |first5=C. |title=Sopravvivenza delle larve muscolari di ''Trichinella britovi'' nei muscoli congelati di cinghiale |journal=Archivo Veterinario Italiano |date=1992 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=57–60}}</ref>

In the 1960s, "trichinella infection" was documented in [[Senegal]], [[West Africa]]. A survey of 160 wild animals from that region produced plausible evidence that European strains may have originated in Africa. It has also been proposed that strains of ''T. britovi'' are isolated to both African and European populations.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17007233 |title=''Trichinella britovi'' etiological agent of sylvatic trichinellosis in the Republic of Guinea (West Africa) and a re-evaluation of geographical distribution for encapsulated species in Africa |last1=Pozio |first1=E. |last2=Pagani |first2=P. |last3=Marucci |first3=G. |last4=Zarlenga |first4=D.

Three cases of human trichinellosis due to ''T. britovi'' were reported in 2015 in the Southeast of [[France]] resulting from consumption of raw pork sausages (''figatelli'') prepared in [[Corsica]]. Fourteen other people ate ''figatelli'' from the same batch, but were not infected due to the ''figatelli'' being well cooked.<ref name="RuetschDelaunay2016">{{cite journal|last1=Ruetsch|first1=Caroline|last2=Delaunay|first2=Pascal|last3=Armengaud|first3=Alexis|last4=Peloux-Petiot|first4=Françoise|last5=Dupouy-Camet|first5=Jean|last6=Vallée|first6=Isabelle|last7=Polack|first7=Bruno|last8=Boireau|first8=Pascal|last9=Marty|first9=Pierre|title=Inadequate labeling of pork sausages prepared in Corsica causing a trichinellosis outbreak in France|journal=Parasite|volume=23|year=2016|pages=27|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2016027|pmid=27317463|url= |pmc=4912683}} {{open access}}</ref>

Several outbreaks of human trichinellosis happened in the South of France or in the Piedmont region in Italy from 1993 to 2022, generally caused by the consumption of undercooked wild boar meat.<ref name="Peju2023">{{cite journal | last1=Peju | first1=Martin | last2=Granier | first2=Bérangère | last3=Garnaud | first3=Cécile | last4=Brenier-Pinchart | first4=Marie-Pierre | last5=Vallée | first5=Isabelle | last6=Chevillot | first6=Aurélie | last7=Mérel | first7=Charlotte | last8=Chereau | first8=Fanny | last9=Deher | first9=Muriel | last10=Rogeaux | first10=Olivier | last11=Yera | first11=Hélène | title=A ''Trichinella britovi'' outbreak in the Northern Alps of France: investigation by a local survey network | journal=Parasite | volume=30 | year=2023 | doi=10.1051/parasite/2023017 | page=14| pmid=37171388 | pmc=10177977 }} {{open access}}</ref>

== Hosts and Life Cycle ==
There is not one preferred host or definitive host for ''Trichinella.''<ref name=":0" /> The adults worms and the developing larvae inhabit the same infected vertebrate host that will serve as the definitive host and possibly even the intermediate host.<ref name=":0" />  The life cycle of all species in the genus ''Trichinella'' consist of two generations, reproductive adults and larvae that grow to the infective state, where the larvae will encyst in mammalian hosts.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Gottstein |first1=Bruno |last2=Pozio |first2=Edoardo |last3=Nöckler |first3=Karsten |date=January 2009 |title=Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control of Trichinellosis |url= |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=127–145 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00026-08 |issn=0893-8512 |pmid=2620635 |pmc=2620635 }}</ref> The hosts that affect infections in humans include the following: pigs, horses, wild boars, dogs, walruses, foxes, moose, and bears.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Its life cycle begins with the ingestion of an infected animal's meat, or muscle tissue where the larvae of the parasite were encysted. <ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The larvae are released when digested in the stomach and penetrate the intestinal mucosa of the small intestine where in about 48 hours, the larvae will reach their adult stage. <ref name=":1" /> The male and female adults mate and after 5-7 days after infection, the female worms release new larvae into the lymphatic and blood vessels. <ref name=":1" /> The larvae use these vessels as transportation to the highly oxygenated muscle cells in the body. <ref name=":1" />Within a few weeks, the host's immune response with kill all of the adult worms in the body and the larvae will begin to penetrate the muscle tissue/cells.<ref name=":1" /> The larvae will develop into the infective stage within the infected muscle cells that are now call nurse cells<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wu |first1=Zhiliang |last2=Sofronic-Milosavljevic |first2=Lj |last3=Nagano |first3=Isao |last4=Takahashi |first4=Yuzo |date=19 August 2008 |title=Trichinella spiralis: nurse cell formation with emphasis on analogy to muscle cell repair |journal=Parasites & Vectors |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |doi=10.1186/1756-3305-1-27 |issn=1756-3305 |pmid=2538513 |doi-access=free |pmc=2538513 }}</ref> and encyst in the muscle tissue.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> After a certain period of time, this could be week, months, or even years, the cysts will undergo a calcification process if the larvae not ingested by another animal.<ref name=":1" />

== Symptoms and Diagnosis ==
Light infections may be show no signs of infection (asymptomatic).<ref name=":0" /> In cases where the adult worms have begun reproducing, you may see gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting.<ref name=":0" /> When the larvae penetrate into the muscle cell and start encysting, it can cause periorbital and facial edema, conjunctivitis, fever, myalgias, splinter hemorrhages, rashes, and peripheral eosinophilia.<ref name=":0" /> There can be life-threatening effects myocarditis, central nervous system involvement, and pneumonitis, however, they are uncommon.<ref name=":0" />

To confirm a diagnosis of trichinellosis by ''T. britovi'', the larvae must be found in the blood by serology or encysted larvae must be found in a biopsy or autopsy of the infected host.<ref name=":0" /> 

==Prevention==
To prevent trichinellosis, an official European directive<ref>Council Directive 77/96/EEC of 21 December 1976 on the examination for trichinae (''Trichinella spiralis'') upon importation from third countries of fresh meat derived from domestic swine. O.J. No L26 of 31.1.1977, p. 67.</ref> recommends the freezing of meat at {{convert|−25|°C|0}} for at least 10 days for pieces of meat less than {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on|0}} in thickness. Patients froze wild boar steaks at {{convert|−35|°C|0}} for seven days, but this freezing time appears insufficient to kill larvae, since ''T.&nbsp;britovi'' is a species relatively resistant to freezing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pozio |first1=E. |last2=Zarlenga |first2=D. S. |date=October 2005 |title=Recent advances on the taxonomy, systematics and epidemiology of ''Trichinella'' |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=35 |issue=11–12 |pages=1191–204 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2005.07.012 |pmid=16153648|url=https://naldc-legacy.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=36216&content=PDF }}</ref>

Thus according to the International Commission on Trichinellosis, meat should be heated at {{convert|65|°C|0}} for at least 1 minute to kill ''Trichinella'' larvae; larvae die when the color of the meat at the core changes from pink to brown.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gamble |first1=H.
