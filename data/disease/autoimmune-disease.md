An '''autoimmune disease''' is a condition that results from an anomalous response of the [[adaptive immune system]], wherein it mistakenly targets and attacks healthy, functioning parts of the body as if they were foreign organisms.<ref name="NIH">{{cite web |url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/autoimmune-diseases |title=Autoimmune diseases |date=22 February 2021 |department=Office on Women's Health |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005144045/https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/autoimmune-diseases.html |archive-date=5 October 2016 |access-date=5 October 2016 }}</ref> It is estimated that there are more than 80 recognized autoimmune diseases, with recent scientific evidence suggesting the existence of potentially more than 100 distinct conditions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=List of Autoimmune Diseases |url=https://www.autoimmuneregistry.org/autoimmune-diseases |access-date=2022-06-06 |website=Autoimmune Registry Inc. |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Angum F, Khan T, Kaler J, Siddiqui L, Hussain A | title = The Prevalence of Autoimmune Disorders in Women: A Narrative Review | journal = Cureus | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = e8094 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32542149 | pmc = 7292717 | doi = 10.7759/cureus.8094 | s2cid = 219447364 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Assessment of NIH Research on Autoimmune Diseases |url=https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/assessment-of-nih-research-on-autoimmune-diseases |access-date=2022-06-13 |website=www.nationalacademies.org}}</ref> Nearly any body part can be involved.<ref name=Bor2010>{{cite book | vauthors = Borgelt LM |title= Women's Health Across the Lifespan: A Pharmacotherapeutic Approach |date=2010 |publisher=ASHP |isbn=978-1-58528-194-7 |page=579 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riP3pxq2jWAC&pg=PA579 |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908184552/https://books.google.com/books?id=riP3pxq2jWAC&pg=PA579 |archive-date=2017-09-08}}</ref>

Autoimmune diseases are a separate class from [[autoinflammatory diseases]]. Both are characterized by an [[immune system]] malfunction which may cause similar symptoms, such as rash, swelling, or fatigue, but the cardinal cause or mechanism of the diseases are different. A key difference is a malfunction of the [[innate immune system]] in autoinflammatory diseases, whereas in autoimmune diseases there is a malfunction of the [[adaptive immune system]].<ref name="pmid_23322404">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zen M, Gatto M, Domeneghetti M, Palma L, Borella E, Iaccarino L, Punzi L, Doria A | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical guidelines and definitions of autoinflammatory diseases: contrasts and comparisons with autoimmunity-a comprehensive review | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–235 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23322404 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-013-8355-1 | s2cid = 23061331 }}</ref>

[[Signs and symptoms|Symptoms]] of autoimmune diseases can significantly vary, primarily based on the specific type of the disease and the body part that it affects. Symptoms are often diverse and can be fleeting, fluctuating from mild to severe, and typically comprise low-grade [[fever]], [[fatigue]], and general [[malaise]].<ref name=NIH/> However, some autoimmune diseases may present with more specific symptoms such as [[Arthralgia|joint pain]], [[Rash|skin rashes]] (e.g., [[urticaria]]), or neurological symptoms.

The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain unclear and are likely multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental influences.<ref name=Bor2010/>  While some diseases like [[lupus]] exhibit familial aggregation, suggesting a genetic predisposition, other cases have been associated with infectious triggers or exposure to environmental factors, implying a complex interplay between genes and environment in their etiology.

Some of the most common diseases that are generally categorized as autoimmune include [[celiac disease]], [[type 1 diabetes]], [[Graves' disease]], [[inflammatory bowel diseases]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]), [[multiple sclerosis]], [[alopecia areata]],<ref name="Erjavec">{{cite journal | vauthors = Erjavec SO, Gelfman S, Abdelaziz AR, Lee EY, Monga I, Alkelai A, Ionita-Laza I, Petukhova L, Christiano AM | display-authors = 6 | title = Whole exome sequencing in Alopecia Areata identifies rare variants in KRT82 | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 800 | date = February 2022 | pmid = 35145093 | pmc = 8831607 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-022-28343-3 | bibcode = 2022NatCo..13..800E }}</ref> [[Addison's disease]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[psoriasis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging due to their diverse presentations and the transient nature of many symptoms.<ref name=NIH/>

Treatment modalities for autoimmune diseases vary based on the type of disease and its severity.<ref name=NIH/>  Therapeutic approaches primarily aim to manage symptoms, reduce immune system activity, and maintain the body's ability to fight diseases. [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) and [[immunosuppressants]] are commonly used to reduce inflammation and control the overactive immune response. In certain cases, [[Immunoglobulin therapy|intravenous immunoglobulin]] may be administered to regulate the immune system.<ref name=Kat2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Katz U, Shoenfeld Y, Zandman-Goddard G | title = Update on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) mechanisms of action and off- label use in autoimmune diseases | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 17 | issue = 29 | pages = 3166–3175 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21864262 | doi = 10.2174/138161211798157540 }}</ref> Despite these treatments often leading to symptom improvement, they usually do not offer a cure and long-term management is often required.<ref name=NIH/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File: Rheumatoid Arthritis.JPG|thumb|Rheumatoid arthritis]]

Autoimmune diseases represent a vast and diverse category of disorders that, despite their differences, share some common symptomatic threads.<ref name=NIH/> These shared symptoms occur as a result of the body's immune system mistakenly attacking its own cells and tissues, causing inflammation and damage. However, due to the broad range of autoimmune diseases, the specific presentation of symptoms can significantly vary based on the type of disease, the organ systems affected, and individual factors such as age, sex, hormonal status, and environmental influences.<ref name=NIH/>

An individual may simultaneously have more than one autoimmune disease (known as polyautoimmunity), further complicating the symptomatology.<ref name=NIH/>

===Common symptoms===
Symptoms that are commonly associated with autoimmune diseases include:<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{cite web |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm |title=Autoimmune disorders | publisher = MedlinePlus, US National Library of Medicine |date=16 July 2013|access-date=12 July 2023 }}</ref>
* [[fatigue]]. This is the most common complaint of people with autoimmune disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zielinski MR, Systrom DM, Rose NR | title = Fatigue, Sleep, and Autoimmune and Related Disorders | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 10 | pages = 1827 | date = 2019-08-06 | pmid = 31447842 | pmc = 6691096 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01827 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2015 US survey found that 98% of people with autoimmune diseases experienced fatigue, 89% said it was a "major issue", 68% said "fatigue is anything but normal. It is profound and prevents [them] from doing the simplest everyday tasks." and 59% said it was "probably the most debilitating symptom of having an AD."<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Baumer K |date=2015-03-23 |title=Fatigue Survey Results Released |url=https://autoimmune.org/fatigue-survey-results-released/ |access-date=2024-01-25 |website=Autoimmune Association |language=en-US}}</ref>
* low-grade fever
* malaise (a general feeling of discomfort or unease)
* muscle aches
* joint pain
* skin rashes

Specific autoimmune diseases have a wide range of other symptoms, with examples including dry mouth, dry eyes, tingling and numbness in parts of the body, unexpected weight loss or gain, and diarrhoea.

===Patterns of symptom occurrence===
These symptoms often reflect the body's systemic inflammatory response. However, their occurrence and intensity can fluctuate over time, leading to periods of heightened disease activity, referred to as flare-ups, and periods of relative inactivity, known as remissions.

The specific presentation of symptoms largely depends on the location and type of autoimmune response. For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints, symptoms typically include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. On the other hand, type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune attack on the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, primarily presents with symptoms related to high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss.

===Commonly affected  body areas===
Commonly affected areas in autoimmune diseases include blood vessels, connective tissues, joints, muscles, red blood cells, skin, and endocrine glands such as the thyroid gland (in diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease) and the pancreas (in type 1 diabetes). The impacts of these diseases can range from localized damage to certain tissues, alteration in organ growth and function, to more systemic effects when multiple tissues throughout the body are affected.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith DA, Germolec DR | title = Introduction to immunology and autoimmunity | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 107 | issue = Suppl 5 | pages = 661–665 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10502528 | pmc = 1566249 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.99107s5661 }}</ref>

===Value of tracking symptom occurrence===
The appearance of these signs and symptoms can not only provide clues for the diagnosis of an autoimmune condition, often in conjunction with tests for specific biological markers, but also help monitor disease progression and response to treatment.<ref>{{cite book | author = National Research Council (US) Subcommittee on Immunotoxicology |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235671/|title=Autoimmune Diseases|date=1992|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref> Ultimately, due to the diverse nature of autoimmune diseases, a multidimensional approach is often needed for the management of these conditions, taking into consideration the variety of symptoms and their impacts on individuals' lives.

=== Coeliac disease ===
[[Coeliac disease]] is an immune reaction to eating [[gluten]], a protein found in [[wheat]], [[barley]], and [[rye]].<ref name="Franks_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks AL, Slansky JE | title = Multiple associations between a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer | journal = Anticancer Research | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 1119–1136 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22493341 | pmc = 3349285 }}</ref>  For those with the disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in the [[small intestine]], leading to damage on the [[Intestinal villus|villi]], small fingerlike projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> This explains the increased risk of [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s, as the gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus, all areas that the ingested gluten would traverse in digestion.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> The incidence of gastrointestinal cancer can be partially reduced or eliminated if a patient removes gluten from their diet.<ref name="Franks_2012" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–23 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 | s2cid = 24980464 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Green PH, Fleischauer AT, Bhagat G, Goyal R, Jabri B, Neugut AI | title = Risk of malignancy in patients with celiac disease | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–195 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12935825 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9343(03)00302-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volta U, Vincentini O, Silano M | title = Papillary cancer of thyroid in celiac disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = e44–e46 | date = 2011 | pmid = 20697293 | doi = 10.1097/mcg.0b013e3181ea11cb | s2cid = 24754769 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Catassi C, Bearzi I, Holmes GK | title = Association of celiac disease and intestinal lymphomas and other cancers | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S79–S86 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15825131 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.02.027 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Additionally, coeliac disease is correlated with [[lymphoproliferative disorders]].<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Graves' disease ===
[[Graves' disease]] is a condition characterized by development of autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors (TRAb). The binding of TRAb autoantibodies to TSH receptor results in unregulated production and release of [[Thyroid hormones|thyroid hormone]],<ref name="MedlinePlus 2013 b611">{{cite web | title=Graves disease: MedlinePlus Genetics | website=MedlinePlus | date=2013-07-01 | url=https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/graves-disease/ | access-date=2023-06-25}}</ref> which can lead to stimulatory effects such as rapid heart rate, weight loss, nervousness, and irritability. Other symptoms more specific to Graves' disease include [[Graves' ophthalmopathy|bulging eyes]] and [[Pretibial myxedema|swelling of the lower legs]].

=== Inflammatory bowel disease ===
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, including [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]. In both cases, individuals with IBD lose immune tolerance for normal bacteria present in the gut [[microbiome]].<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Symptoms include severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. IBD is associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and some lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
[[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the immune system attacks [[myelin]], a protective covering of nerve fibers in the central nervous system, causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, and problems with coordination and balance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frohman EM, Racke MK, Raine CS | title = Multiple sclerosis--the plaque and its pathogenesis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 9 | pages = 942–955 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16510748 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra052130 }}</ref> MS is associated with an increased risk of [[central nervous system]] cancer, primarily in the brain.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Rheumatoid arthritis ===
[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) primarily targets the joints, causing persistent inflammation that results in joint damage and pain. It's often symmetrical, meaning that if one hand or knee has it, the other one does too. RA can also affect the heart, lungs, and eyes. Additionally, the chronic inflammation and over-activation of the immune system creates an environment that favors further malignant transformation of other cells, perhaps explaining the associations with cancer of the lungs and skin as well as the increased risk of other hematologic cancers, none of which are directly affected by the inflammation of joints.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Turesson C, Matteson EL |chapter=Clinical Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis: Extra-Articular Manifestations|date=2009|title =Rheumatoid Arthritis|pages=62–67|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-05475-1|doi=10.1016/b978-032305475-1.50014-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khurana R, Berney SM | title = Clinical aspects of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Pathophysiology | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–165 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16125918 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathophys.2005.07.009 }}</ref>

=== Psoriasis and Psoriatic arthritis ===
[[Psoriasis]] is a skin condition characterized by the rapid buildup of skin cells, leading to scaling on the skin's surface. Inflammation and redness around the scales is common.<ref name="National Library of Medicine 2019 x804">{{cite web | title=Psoriasis - Psoriatic Arthritis | publisher=National Library of Medicine | date=2019-02-20 | url=https://medlineplus.gov/psoriasis.html | access-date=2023-06-25}}</ref> Some individuals with psoriasis also develop [[psoriatic arthritis]], which causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.<ref name="National Library of Medicine 2016 i430">{{cite web | title=Psoriatic Arthritis | publisher=National Library of Medicine | date=2016-08-25 | url=https://medlineplus.gov/psoriaticarthritis.html | access-date=2023-06-25}}</ref>

===Sjögren's syndrome===
Sjögren syndrome (SjS, SS) is a long-term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture-producing glands (lacrimal and salivary),[4] and often seriously affects other organ systems, such as the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.

=== Systemic lupus erythematosus ===
[[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), referred to simply as lupus, is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and the nervous system. It is characterized by a widespread loss of immune tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsokos GC | title = Systemic lupus erythematosus | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 22 | pages = 2110–2121 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22129255 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1100359 }}</ref> The disease is characterized by periods of flares and remissions, and symptoms range from mild to severe.

=== Type 1 diabetes ===
[[Type 1 diabetes]] is a condition resulting from the immune system attacking insulin-producing [[beta cells]] in the [[pancreas]], leading to [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] levels. Symptoms include increased [[thirst]], [[frequent urination]], and unexplained [[weight loss]]. It's most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults.<ref name="National Library of Medicine 2020 h413">{{cite web | title=Type 1 Diabetes - Juvenile Diabetes | publisher=National Library of Medicine | date=2020-06-29 | url=https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html | access-date=2023-06-25}}</ref>

=== Undifferentiated connective tissue disease ===
[[UCTD]] occurs when people have features of connective tissue disease, such as blood test results and external characteristics, but do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria established for any one connective tissue disease. Some 30-40% transition to a specific connective tissue disease over time.

== Causes ==
The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown;<ref name=Bor2010/> however, research has suggested that a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors, as well as certain infections, may contribute to the development of these disorders.<ref name=NIH/>

The [[human]] [[immune system]] is equipped with several mechanisms to maintain a delicate balance between defending against foreign invaders and protecting its own cells. To achieve this, it generates both [[T cells]] and [[B cells]], which are capable of reacting with self-proteins. However, in a healthy immune response, self-reactive cells are generally either eliminated before they become active, rendered inert via a process called anergy, or their activities are suppressed by regulatory cells.

=== Genetics ===
A familial tendency to develop autoimmune diseases suggests a genetic component. Some conditions, like lupus and multiple sclerosis, often occur in several members of the same family, indicating a potential hereditary link. Additionally, certain genes have been identified that increase the risk of developing specific autoimmune diseases.

==== Genetic predisposition ====
Evidence suggests a strong genetic component in the development of autoimmune diseases.<ref name="Antonelli Ferrari Ragusa Elia 2020 p. 101387">{{cite journal | vauthors = Antonelli A, Ferrari SM, Ragusa F, Elia G, Paparo SR, Ruffilli I, Patrizio A, Giusti C, Gonnella D, Cristaudo A, Foddis R, Shoenfeld Y, Fallahi P | display-authors = 6 | title = Graves' disease: Epidemiology, genetic and environmental risk factors and viruses | journal = Best Practice & Research.

Experimental methods like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven instrumental in pinpointing genetic risk variants potentially responsible for autoimmune diseases. For example, these studies have been used to identify risk variants for diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and Rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name="Lettre Rioux 2008 pp. R116–R121">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lettre G, Rioux JD | title = Autoimmune diseases: insights from genome-wide association studies | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = R2 | pages = R116–R121 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18852199 | pmc = 2782355 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddn246 | publisher = Oxford University Press (OUP) }}</ref>

In twin studies, autoimmune diseases consistently demonstrate a higher concordance rate among identical twins compared with fraternal twins.

==== Balancing infection and autoimmunity ====
There's increasing evidence that certain genes selected during evolution offer a balance between susceptibility to infection and our capacity to avoid autoimmune diseases.<ref name="McKinney Lee Jayne Lyons 2015 pp. 612–616">{{cite journal | vauthors = McKinney EF, Lee JC, Jayne DR, Lyons PA, Smith KG | title = T-cell exhaustion, co-stimulation and clinical outcome in autoimmunity and infection | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | issue = 7562 | pages = 612–616 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26123020 | pmc = 4623162 | doi = 10.1038/nature14468 | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media LLC | bibcode = 2015Natur.523..612M }}</ref> For example, variants in the ERAP2 gene provide some resistance to infection even though they increase the risk of autoimmunity (positive selection).

Several experimental methods such as the [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic risk variants that may be responsible<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregersen PK, Olsson LM | title = Recent advances in the genetics of autoimmune disease | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 27 | pages = 363–391 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19302045 | pmc = 2992886 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132653 }}</ref> for diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and Rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name="Hill_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill NJ, King C, Flodstrom-Tullberg M | title = Recent acquisitions on the genetic basis of autoimmune disease | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 13 | issue = 13 | pages = 4838–4851 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18508549 | doi = 10.2741/3043 }}</ref>

Similarly, in [[Twin study|twin studies]], autoimmune diseases consistently demonstrate a higher concordance rate among identical twins compared with fraternal twins, e.g. 35% vs. 6% in [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filippi M, Bar-Or A, Piehl F, Preziosa P, Solari A, Vukusic S, Rocca MA | title = Multiple sclerosis | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Environmental factors ===
A significant number of environmental factors have been implicated in the development and progression of various autoimmune diseases, either directly or as catalysts. Current research suggests that up to seventy percent of autoimmune diseases could be attributed to environmental influences, which encompass an array of elements such as chemicals, infectious agents, dietary habits, and gut dysbiosis. However, a unifying theory that definitively explains the onset of autoimmune diseases remains elusive, emphasizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of these conditions.
<ref name="pmid24688790">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vojdani A | title = A Potential Link between Environmental Triggers and Autoimmunity | journal = Autoimmune Diseases | volume = 2014 | pages = 437231 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24688790 | pmc = 3945069 | doi = 10.1155/2014/437231 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Various environmental triggers are identified, some of which include:
* Impaired [[oral tolerance]]
* Gut [[dysbiosis]]
* Increased [[Intestinal permeability|gut permeability]]
* Heightened immune reactivity

Chemicals, which are either a part of our immediate environment or found in drugs, are key players in this context. Examples of such chemicals include [[hydrazines]], [[hair dyes]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[tartrazine]]s, hazardous wastes, and industrial emissions.<ref name="BCH">{{cite web | title = Autoimmune Diseases: Symptoms & Causes | publisher = Boston Children's Hospital | access-date = 23 March 2020 | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/a/autoimmune-diseases/symptoms-and-causes | archive-date = 7 April 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210407003517/https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/a/autoimmune-diseases/symptoms-and-causes | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Infectious agents are also being increasingly recognized for their role as T cell activators {{emdash}} a crucial step in triggering autoimmune diseases. The exact mechanisms by which they contribute to disease onset remain to be fully understood.

=== Dysregulated immune response ===
Another area of interest is the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self, a function that's compromised in autoimmune diseases. In healthy individuals, immune tolerance prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own cells. When this process fails, the immune system may produce antibodies against its own tissues, leading to an autoimmune response.<ref name="Conigliaro Triggianese Ballanti Perricone 2019 pp. 532–541">{{cite journal | vauthors = Conigliaro P, Triggianese P, Ballanti E, Perricone C, Perricone R, Chimenti MS | title = Complement, infection, and autoimmunity | journal = Current Opinion in Rheumatology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 532–541 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31192812 | doi = 10.1097/bor.0000000000000633 | publisher = Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 189813866 | hdl = 2108/225709 }}</ref>

=== Negative selection and the role of the thymus ===
The elimination of self-reactive T cells occurs primarily through a mechanism known as "negative selection" within the thymus, an organ responsible for the maturation of T cells.<ref name="Bruserud Oftedal Wolff Husebye 2016 pp. 8–15">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruserud Ø, Oftedal BE, Wolff AB, Husebye ES | title = AIRE-mutations and autoimmune disease | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 43 | pages = 8–15 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27504588 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2016.07.003 | publisher = Elsevier BV }}</ref> This process serves as a key line of defense against autoimmunity. If these protective mechanisms fail, a pool of self-reactive cells can become functional within the immune system, contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases.

=== Molecular mimicry ===

Some infectious agents, like Campylobacter jejuni, bear antigens that resemble, but are not identical to, the body's self-molecules. This phenomenon, known as [[molecular mimicry]], can lead to cross-reactivity, where the immune response to such infections inadvertently results in the production of antibodies that also react with self-antigens.<ref name="Rojas Restrepo-Jiménez Monsalve Pacheco 2018 pp. 100–123">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rojas M, Restrepo-Jiménez P, Monsalve DM, Pacheco Y, Acosta-Ampudia Y, Ramírez-Santana C, Leung PS, Ansari AA, Gershwin ME, Anaya JM | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular mimicry and autoimmunity | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 95 | pages = 100–123 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30509385 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2018.10.012 | publisher = Elsevier BV | s2cid = 54500571 | doi-access = free }}</ref> An example of this is Guillain–Barré syndrome, in which antibodies generated in response to a C. jejuni infection also react with the gangliosides in the myelin sheath of peripheral nerve axons.<ref name="Jasti Selmi Sarmiento-Monroy Vega 2016 pp. 1175–1189">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jasti AK, Selmi C, Sarmiento-Monroy JC, Vega DA, Anaya JM, Gershwin ME | title = Guillain-Barré syndrome: causes, immunopathogenic mechanisms and treatment | journal = Expert Review of Clinical Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 1175–1189 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27292311 | doi = 10.1080/1744666x.2016.1193006 | publisher = Informa UK Limited | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 45391831 | hdl = 2434/424557 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Diagnosis|Diagnosing]] autoimmune disorders can be complex due to the wide range of diseases within this category and their often overlapping symptoms. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for determining appropriate treatment strategies. Generally, the diagnostic process involves a combination of [[medical history]] evaluation, [[physical examination]], [[Medical laboratory|laboratory tests]], and, in some cases, imaging or [[biopsies]].<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Autoimmune disorders | encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | access-date = 23 March 2020 | url = https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000816.htm }}</ref>

=== Medical history and examination ===

The first step in diagnosing autoimmune disorders typically involves a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history and a comprehensive physical examination.<ref name="Wang Wang Gershwin 2015 pp. 369–395"/> Clinicians often pay close attention to the patient's symptoms, [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of autoimmune diseases, and any exposure to environmental factors that might trigger an autoimmune response. The physical examination can reveal signs of inflammation or organ damage, which are common features of autoimmune disorders.

=== Laboratory tests ===

Laboratory testing plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. These tests can identify the presence of certain autoantibodies or other immune markers that indicate a self-directed immune response.

* '''Autoantibody testing:''' Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by the presence of [[autoantibodies]]. Blood tests can identify these antibodies, which are directed against the body's own tissues.<ref>{{cite web | title = Antinuclear Antibody (ANA). | access-date = 14 April 2020 | url = https://labtestsonline.org/tests/antinuclear-antibody-ana | work = labtestsonline.org }}</ref> For example, antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is commonly used in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases.
* '''[[Complete Blood Count]] (CBC):''' A CBC can provide valuable information about the number and characteristics of different blood cells, which can be affected in some autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite web | title = Complete blood count (CBC) | date = 19 December 2018 | access-date = 14 April 2020 | url = https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/complete-blood-count/about/pac-20384919 | work = www.mayoclinic.org }}</ref><ref name="BCH" /><ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" />
* '''[[C-Reactive Protein]] (CRP) and [[Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]] (ESR):''' These tests measure the levels of inflammation in the body, which is often elevated in autoimmune disorders.<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" /><ref name="BCH" />
* '''Organ-specific tests:''' Certain autoimmune diseases target specific organs, so tests to evaluate the function of these organs can aid in diagnosis. For example, thyroid function tests are used in diagnosing autoimmune thyroid disorders, while a biopsy can diagnose celiac disease by identifying damage to the small intestine.

=== Imaging studies ===

In some cases, imaging studies may be used to assess the extent of organ involvement and damage. For example, chest [[x-rays]] or [[CT scans]] can identify lung involvement in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, while an [[MRI]] can reveal inflammation or damage in the brain and spinal cord in multiple sclerosis.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Given the variety and nonspecific nature of symptoms that can be associated with autoimmune diseases, differential diagnosis—determining which of several diseases with similar symptoms is causing a patient's illness—is an important part of the diagnostic process. This often involves ruling out other potential causes of symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or genetic disorders.

=== Multidisciplinary approach ===

Given the systemic nature of many autoimmune disorders, a multidisciplinary approach may be necessary for their diagnosis and management. This can involve rheumatologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, dermatologists, and other specialists, depending on the organs or systems affected by the disease.

In summary, the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders is a complex process that requires a thorough evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. Due to the diverse nature of these diseases, an individualized approach, often involving multiple specialists, is crucial for an accurate diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition. The majority of the autoimmune diseases are chronic and there is no definitive cure, but symptoms can be alleviated and controlled with treatment.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/>
Standard treatment methods include:<ref name="MedlinePlus"/>
* Vitamin or hormone supplements for what the body is lacking due to the disease (insulin, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, thyroid hormone, etc.)
* Blood transfusions if the disease is blood related
* Physical therapy if the disease impacts bones, joints, or muscles

Traditional treatment options include immunosuppressant drugs to reduce the immune response against the body's own tissues, such as:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li P, Zheng Y, Chen X | title = Drugs for Autoimmune Inflammatory Diseases: From Small Molecule Compounds to Anti-TNF Biologics | journal = Frontiers in Pharmacology | volume = 8 | pages = 460 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28785220 | pmc = 5506195 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2017.00460 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation
* Glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation
* [[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug|Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) to decrease the damaging tissue and organ effects of the inflammatory autoimmune response

In both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the condition arises through aberrant reactions of the human adaptive or innate immune systems. In autoimmunity, the patient's immune system is activated against the body's own proteins. In chronic inflammatory diseases, [[neutrophil]]s and other [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] are constitutively recruited by [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s, resulting in tissue damage.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neutrophil migration in infection and wound repair: going forward in reverse |date=2016 |pmc=5367630 |journal=Nature Reviews.

Mitigation of inflammation by activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the suppression of inflammatory genes in immune cells is a promising therapeutic approach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukundan L, Odegaard JI, Morel CR, Heredia JE, Mwangi JW, Ricardo-Gonzalez RR, Goh YP, Eagle AR, Dunn SE, Awakuni JU, Nguyen KD, Steinman L, Michie SA, Chawla A | display-authors = 6 | title = PPAR-delta senses and orchestrates clearance of apoptotic cells to promote tolerance | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1266–1272 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19838202 | pmc = 2783696 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roszer T, Menéndez-Gutiérrez MP, Lefterova MI, Alameda D, Núñez V, Lazar MA, Fischer T, Ricote M | display-authors = 6 | title = Autoimmune kidney disease and impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells in mice with macrophage peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma or retinoid X receptor alpha deficiency | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 186 | issue = 1 | pages = 621–631 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21135166 | pmc = 4038038 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.1002230 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22155015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh RP, Waldron RT, Hahn BH | title = Genes, tolerance and systemic autoimmunity | journal = Autoimmunity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 664–669 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22155015 | pmc = 3306516 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.017 }}</ref> There is a body of evidence that once the production of [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] has been initialized, autoantibodies have the capacity to maintain their own production.<ref name="pmid12911286">{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm I | title = Disruption of the cytoskeleton after apoptosis induction with autoantibodies | journal = Autoimmunity | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–189 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12911286 | doi = 10.1080/0891693031000105617 | s2cid = 37887253 }}</ref>

=== Stem-cell therapy ===

=== Altered glycan theory ===

According to this theory, the effector function of the immune response is mediated by the [[glycans]] (polysaccharides) displayed by the cells and humoral components of the immune system. Individuals with autoimmunity have alterations in their glycosylation profile such that a proinflammatory immune response is favored. It is further hypothesized that individual autoimmune diseases will have unique glycan signatures.<ref name="pmid25578468">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | display-authors = 6 | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}</ref>

=== Hygiene hypothesis ===
According to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], high levels of cleanliness expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their immune systems to become overactive and more likely to misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune or allergic conditions such as asthma.<ref name="pmid22090147">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rook GA | title = Hygiene hypothesis and autoimmune diseases | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22090147 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-011-8285-8 | s2cid = 15302882 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Vitamin D influence on immune response ===
