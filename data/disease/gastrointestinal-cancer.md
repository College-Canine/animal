'''Gastrointestinal cancer''' refers to [[malignant]] conditions of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (GI tract) and [[accessory organs of digestion]], including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires [[endoscopy]], followed by [[biopsy]] of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.

Overall, the GI tract and the accessory organs of digestion (pancreas, liver, gall bladder) are responsible for more cancers and more deaths from cancer than any other system in the body.<ref name=Yamada2009 >{{cite book|vauthors=Yamada T, Alpers DH|display-authors=etal |title=Textbook of gastroenterology| year=2009| publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-6911-0| edition=5th|pages=603, 1028|oclc=404100761}}</ref><ref name=Bjelakovic2008>{{cite journal| last=Bjelakovic|first=G|author2=Nikolova, D |author3=Simonetti, RG |author4= Gluud, C |title=Antioxidant supplements for preventing gastrointestinal cancers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jul 16, 2008|issue=3|pages=CD004183|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004183.pub3|pmid=18677777}}</ref> There is significant geographic variation in the rates of different gastrointestinal cancers.<ref name=Yamada2009 />

Worldwide, the incidence of each type is about the same, but in developed countries like North America and Europe adenocarcinoma is the more common.<ref name=Yang2012 />

Cancer of the [[esophagus]] is often detected late inasmuch as there are typically no early symptoms. Nevertheless, if the cancer is caught soon enough, patients can have a [[five-year survival rate]] of 90% or above.  By the time esophageal cancer is usually detected, though, it might have spread beyond the esophageal wall, and the survival rate drops significantly. In China, the overall five-year survival rate for advanced esophageal cancer is about 20%, and in the United States it is about 15%.<ref name=Yang2012 />

===Stomach cancer===
{{main|Stomach cancer}}

Cancer of the [[stomach]], also called gastric cancer, is the fourth-most-common type of cancer and the second-highest cause of cancer death globally.<ref name=Bjelakovic2008 /> Eastern Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia) is a high-risk area for gastric cancer, and North America, Australia, New Zealand and western and northern Africa are areas with low risk.<ref name=Bennett2009>{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=C|author2=Wang, Y |author3=Pan, T |title=Endoscopic mucosal resection for early gastric cancer.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 7, 2009|volume=2009|issue=4|pages=CD004276|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004276.pub3|pmid=19821324|pmc=7199372}}</ref> The most common type of gastric cancer is [[adenocarcinoma]], which causes about 750,000 deaths each year.<ref name="O'Connor2013">{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=A |author2=McNamara, D |author3=O'Moráin, CA|title=Surveillance of gastric intestinal metaplasia for the prevention of gastric cancer.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 23, 2013|volume=9|issue=9 |pages=CD009322|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009322.pub2|pmid=24062262}}</ref> Important factors that may contribute to the development of gastric cancer include diet, smoking and [[alcohol and cancer|alcohol consumption]], genetic aspects (including a number of heritable syndromes) and infections (for example, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' or [[Epstein-Barr virus]]) and [[pernicious anemia]].<ref name=Yamada2009 /><ref name="O'Connor2013" /> Chemotherapy improves survival compared to best supportive care, however the optimal regimen is unclear.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume = 2017|pages = CD004064|last1=Wagner|first1=Anna Dorothea|last2=Syn|first2=Nicholas LX|last3=Moehler|first3=Markus|last4=Grothe|first4=Wilfried|last5=Yong|first5=Wei Peng|last6=Tai|first6=Bee-Choo|last7=Ho|first7=Jingshan|last8=Unverzagt|first8=Susanne| title=Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer |date=2017-08-29| issue=8 |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004064.pub4|pmid = 28850174|url = https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_8819477F408B.P001/REF.pdf|pmc=6483552}}</ref>

===Liver cancer===
{{main|Hepatocellular carcinoma}}

People get liver cancer (also called ''hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC'' or ''hepatoma)'' typically from a prolonged [[Hepatitis B]] or [[Hepatitis C|C]] infection or as a result of [[cirrhosis]] from chronic [[alcoholism]]. Liver cancer may bring about yellowing of the skin and eyes ([[jaundice]]), itching ([[pruritus]]), or cause a buildup of fluid in the abdomen ([[ascites]]).  A person may feel an enlarging mass, or the cancer might be revealed by abnormal [[liver function test]]s.<ref name=ROBBINS2007>{{cite book|editor=Vinay Kumar|display-editors=etal|title=Robbins basic pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1|edition=8th|oclc=804094752}}</ref>{{rp|664–666}}

An attending practitioner might order a [[biopsy]], an [[MRI]] or a [[CT scan]], and a patient might be monitored through blood tests (including [[alpha-fetoprotein]], liver-function tests or [[ultrasound]]. These cancers are typically treated according to their [[TNM staging|TNM stage]] and whether or not [[cirrhosis]] is present.  Options include [[surgical resection]], [[embolisation]], [[ablation]] or a [[liver transplant]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010>{{cite book|editor=Nicki R. Colledge|editor2=Brian R. Walker|editor3=Stuart H.

===Gallbladder cancer===
{{main|Gallbladder cancer}}

Cancers of the gallbladder are typically adenocarcinomas, and are common in elderly women. Gallbladder cancer is strongly associated with [[gallstone]]s, a [[porcelain gallbladder]] appearance on [[ultrasound]], and the presence of polyps within the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer may manifest with weight loss, jaundice, and pain in the upper right of. It is typically diagnosed with [[ultrasound]] and staged with [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]]. The prognosis for gallbladder cancer is poor.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|981}}

===Other===
* [[MALT lymphoma]] is a cancer of the [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]], usually in the stomach.
* [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]s represent from 1% to 3% of gastrointestinal malignancies.
* Cancers of the [[biliary tree]], including [[cholangiocarcinoma]].

==Lower digestive tract==

===Colorectal cancer===
{{main|Colorectal cancer}}
[[Image:Colon cancer 2.jpg|thumb|Example of an invasive [[colorectal cancer]].]]

Colorectal cancer is a disease of [[old age]]. It typically originates in the [[adenocarcinoma|secretory cells lining the gut]], and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it is often associated with [[hereditary]] syndromes like [[Peutz-Jegher's syndrome|Peutz-Jegher's]], [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]], or [[familial adenomatous polyposis]].<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|619–620}} Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]], [[colick]]y bowel pain, a [[bowel obstruction]] or the biopsy of a [[polyp (medicine)|polyp]] at a [[screening (medicine)|screening]] [[colonoscopy]]. [[Rectal tenesmus|A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet]] or [[anemia]] might also point to this kind of cancer.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|911}}

Use of a [[colonoscopy|colonoscope]] can find these cancers, and a [[biopsy]] can reveal the extent of the involvement of the bowel wall. [[hemicolectomy|Removal of a section of the colon]] is necessary for treatment, with or without [[chemotherapy]].  Colorectal cancer has a comparatively good prognosis when detected early.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|911–912}}

===Anal cancer===
{{main|Anal cancer}}

An important anatomic landmark in anal cancer is the [[pectinate line]] (dentate line), which is located about 1–2&nbsp;cm from the [[anal verge]] (where the [[Mucous membrane|anal mucosa]] of the [[anal canal]] becomes skin).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Bruce G. Wolff|title=The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-24846-2|page=1|display-editors=etal}}</ref> Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) are more likely to be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) are more likely to be squamous cell carcinomas that may [[ulcer]]ate. Anal cancer is strongly associated with [[ulcerative colitis]] and the [[sexually transmissible infection]]s [[HPV]] and [[HIV]]. Anal cancer may be a cause of [[constipation]] or [[rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]], or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.<ref name=HARRISONS2008>{{cite book|vauthors = Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper D, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson J, Loscalzo J|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-147692-8|edition=17th|oclc=237889182}}</ref>{{rp|580}}

Anal cancer is investigated by [[biopsy]] and may be treated by [[Surgery|excision]] and [[radiotherapy]], or with external beam radiotherapy and adjunctive chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate with the latter procedure is above 70%.<ref name=HARRISONS2008 />{{rp|580}}

===Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor===
A [[gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor]] is a rare, slow-growing form of cancer that affects certain cells in the lining of the stomach and intestines. The cells it affects make hormones that regulate the production of digestive juices and muscles that move food through the stomach and intestines. This kind of cancer usually occurs in the appendix, small intestine, or rectum. Its presence is associated with an increased risk of cancers affecting the other parts of the digestive system. It is usually treated with surgery.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/gastrointestinalcarcinoid/Patient | title=Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor | publisher=National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health | access-date=15 October 2013| date=1980-01-01 }}<!-- close paraphrasing used; source is US Government and so in public doman --></ref>

==Field defects==
A "field defect" or "[[field cancerization]]" is a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer. Field defects occur in progression to gastrointestinal tract cancers.<ref name="pmid18164807">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Dvorak K, Garewal H |title=Field defects in progression to gastrointestinal tract cancers |journal=Cancer Lett. |volume=260 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–10 |year=2008 |pmid=18164807 |pmc=2744582 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2007.11.027 }}</ref>  These field defects may contain visible gross manifestations, [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic alterations]] and/or mutations.

===Esophagus===
[[Adenocarcinoma]]s of the esophagus tend to arise in a field defect called [[Barrett's esophagus]], a red patch of tissue in the generally pink lower esophagus.  A diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus is confirmed by a [[Metaplasia|metaplastic]] change of the esophageal mucosa from squamous to [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] mucosa with intestinal metaplasia.  Barrett's esophagus is the dominant [[Neoplasm#Malignant neoplasms|pre-malignant]] lesion of esophageal [[adenocarcinoma]],<ref name="pmid26074687">{{cite journal |vauthors=Halland M, Katzka D, Iyer PG |title=Recent developments in pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of Barrett's esophagus |journal=World J.

===Stomach===
Gastric cancer develops within areas (field defects) of the stomach with [[atrophic gastritis]] and [[intestinal metaplasia]]: these lesions represent the cancerization field in which (intestinal-type) gastric cancers develop.<ref name="pmid23809241">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rugge M, Capelle LG, Cappellesso R, Nitti D, Kuipers EJ |title=Precancerous lesions in the stomach: from biology to clinical patient management |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=205–23 |year=2013 |pmid=23809241 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2012.12.007 }}</ref>  In one study, the field defect was clearly demonstrated in gastric carcinogenesis using [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] high throughput data from normal gastric mucosa (from patients who had never had a gastric [[Neoplasm#Malignant neoplasm|malignant neoplasm]]), non-tumor tissue adjacent to a gastric cancer, and gastric cancer tissue.

==Etiology==

[[Bile acid]]s are synthesized in the liver to facilitate [[digestion]] of dietary [[fat]]s.  High exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to bile acids can occur in several different settings, but most significantly is prevalent among individuals who have a high dietary fat intake. High bile acid exposure has been implicated in several cancers of both the upper and lower digestive tract.<ref name = Bernstein2009>Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Payne CM, Dvorak K. Bile acids as endogenous etiologic agents in gastrointestinal cancer. World J Gastroenterol. 2009 Jul 21;15(27):3329-40. doi: 10.3748/wjg.15.3329. PMID: 19610133; PMCID: PMC2712893</ref>  The deleterious effects on cells of elevated bile acid exposure include induction of [[reactive oxygen species]], induction of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] leading to [[mutation]], and induction of [[apoptosis]] in the short term and selection for apoptosis resistance over the long term.<ref name = Bernstein2009/> High levels of bile acids also alter the microbiome and act as signaling molecules, altering the microenvironment of the colon.<ref name="pmid36408538">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein H, Bernstein C |title=Bile acids as carcinogens in the colon and at other sites in the gastrointestinal system |journal=Exp Biol Med (Maywood) |volume=248 |issue=1 |pages=79–89 |date=January 2023 |pmid=36408538 |doi=10.1177/15353702221131858 |url=|pmc=9989147 }}</ref>
