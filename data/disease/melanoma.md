<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
The primary cause of melanoma is [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the [[human skin color|skin pigment]] [[melanin]].<ref name=WCR2014/><ref name="SunM"/> The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as [[tanning lamp|tanning devices]].<ref name=WCR2014/> Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and [[immunosuppression|poor immune function]] are at greater risk.<ref name=NCI2015/> A number of rare [[genetic conditions]], such as [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], also increase the risk.<ref name=Az2014/> Diagnosis is by [[biopsy]] and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.<ref name=NCI2015/>

<!-- Prevention, treatment and prognosis -->
Avoiding UV light and using [[sunscreen]] in UV-bright sun conditions may prevent melanoma.<ref name=WCR2014/> Treatment typically is removal by surgery of the melanoma and the potentially affected adjacent tissue bordering the melanoma.<ref name=NCI2015/> In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby [[lymph nodes]] may be tested for spread ([[metastasis]]).<ref name=NCI2015/> Most people are cured if metastasis has not occurred.<ref name=NCI2015/> For those in whom melanoma has spread, [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]], [[biologic therapy]], [[radiation therapy]], or [[chemotherapy]] may improve survival.<ref name=NCI2015/><ref name="Syn2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Syn NL, Teng MW, Mok TS, Soo RA | title = De-novo and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint targeting | journal = The Lancet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing [[mole (skin marking)|moles]] or, in the case of [[nodular melanoma]], the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may [[itch]], [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]], or bleed.

==Cause==
Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to UV light from the sun. [[#Genetics|Genetics]] also play a role.<ref name="Mayo2016"/><ref name="Greene1999"/> Melanoma can also occur in skin areas with little sun exposure (i.e. mouth, soles of feet, palms of hands, genital areas).<ref name="Goydos 2016 321–329">{{cite book | vauthors = Goydos JS, Shoen SL | title = Melanoma | chapter = Acral Lentiginous Melanoma | series = Cancer Treatment and Research | volume = 167 | pages = 321–9 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26601870 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-22539-5_14 | isbn = 978-3-319-22538-8 }}</ref> People with [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]], also known as familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perkins A, Duffy RL | title = Atypical moles: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 91 | issue = 11 | pages = 762–767 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26034853 }}</ref>

[[UVB]] light, emanating from the sun at wavelengths between 315 and 280&nbsp;nm, is absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells. which results in a type of [[direct DNA damage]] called [[pyrimidine dimers|cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers]]. [[Thymine]], [[cytosine]], or cytosine-thymine [[pyrimidine dimer|dimers]] are formed by the joining of two adjacent [[pyrimidine]] bases within a strand of DNA. [[Ultraviolet A|UVA]] light presents at wavelengths longer than UVB (between 400 and 315&nbsp;nm); and it can also be absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells, but at lower efficiencies{{mdash}}about 1/100 to 1/1000 of UVB.<ref name="pmid22005748">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rünger TM, Farahvash B, Hatvani Z, Rees A | title = Comparison of DNA damage responses following equimutagenic doses of UVA and UVB: a less effective cell cycle arrest with UVA may render UVA-induced pyrimidine dimers more mutagenic than UVB-induced ones | journal = Photochemical & Photobiological Sciences | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 207–215 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22005748 | doi = 10.1039/c1pp05232b | s2cid = 25209863 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Possible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of [[skin pigmentation]]. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from Northern Europe which have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight to which the skin of the settlers is not adapted, most notably Australia. Exposure during childhood is a more important risk factor than exposure in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khlat M, Vail A, Parkin M, Green A | title = Mortality from melanoma in migrants to Australia: variation by age at arrival and duration of stay | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 135 | issue = 10 | pages = 1103–1113 | date = May 1992 | pmid = 1632422 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116210 }}</ref>

Incurring multiple severe sunburns increases the likelihood that future sunburns develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage.<ref name=Mayo2016/> UV-high sunlight and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 September 2022 |title=Can we get skin cancer from tanning beds? |url=https://www.curadermbcc.eu/blog/skin-cancer-from-tanning-beds/ |access-date=3 September 2022 |website=CuradermBCC |language=en-US |archive-date=3 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220903131033/https://www.curadermbcc.eu/blog/skin-cancer-from-tanning-beds/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.<ref name=Mayo2016/>

===Genetics===
A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, greatly increase melanoma susceptibility.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soura E, Eliades PJ, Shannon K, Stratigos AJ, Tsao H | title = Hereditary melanoma: Update on syndromes and management: Genetics of familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–407; quiz 408–410 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26892650 | pmc = 4761105 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.08.038 }}</ref> Several [[gene]]s increase risks. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called [[melanocortin 1 receptor|''MC1R'']] that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk. [[Genetic testing]] can be used to search for the mutations.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

One class of mutations affects the gene [[P16 (gene)|''CDKN2A'']]. An alternative [[reading frame]] mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of [[p53]], a [[transcription factor]] involved in [[apoptosis]] and in 50% of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of [[CDK4]], a [[cyclin]]-dependent [[kinase]] that promotes [[cell division]]. Mutations that cause the skin condition [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]  (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA.

The earliest stage of melanoma starts when melanocytes begin out-of-control growth. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the next layer (the [[dermis]]). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, when the tumor is less than 1&nbsp;mm thick, and spreads at the level of the basal epidermis.<ref name="CiarlettaForet2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciarletta P, Foret L, Ben Amar M | title = The radial growth phase of malignant melanoma: multi-phase modelling, numerical simulations and linear stability analysis | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 8 | issue = 56 | pages = 345–368 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 20656740 | pmc = 3030817 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2010.0285 }}</ref> Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body.

When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction – vertically up into the epidermis and into the [[papillary dermis]] – cell behaviour changes dramatically.<ref name=Hershkovitz10/>

The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, in which individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. From this point on, melanoma is capable of spreading.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}} The [[Breslow's depth]] of the lesion is usually less than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, while the [[Clark level]] is usually 2.

The vertical growth phase (VGP) following is invasive melanoma. The tumor becomes able to grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or [[lymph vessel]]s. The tumor thickness is usually more than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.

However, many melanomas present as lesions smaller than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter, and all melanomas are malignant when they first appear as a small dot. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6&nbsp;mm in diameter. [[Seborrheic keratosis]] may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to [[false alarm]]s. Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination or with [[dermatoscopy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Some advocate replacing "enlarging" with "evolving": moles that change and evolve are a concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer "elevation". Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Ugly duckling===
One method is the "[[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]] sign".<ref name="pmid9828892">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mascaro JM, Mascaro JM | title = The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from "the ugly duckling" to "little red riding hood" | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 134 | issue = 11 | pages = 1484–1485 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9828892 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.134.11.1484 }}
</ref> Correlation of common lesion characteristics is made. Lesions that deviate from the common characteristics are labeled an "ugly duckling", and a further professional exam is required. The "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]" sign<ref name="pmid9828892"/> suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose [[amelanotic melanomas]]. Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble nonmelanomas or are considered to be "[[Wolf in sheep's clothing|wolves in sheep's clothing]]".<ref name="dermnetnz.org">{{cite web|url=http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html|title=Introduction to Dermoscopy|publisher=DermNet New Zealand|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507183545/http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html|archive-date=7 May 2009}}</ref> These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas that do not present easy-to-observe color changes and variations. Their borders are often indistinct, complicating visual identification without a dermatoscope.

Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the "ugly duckling" sign, and are hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, [[benign fibrous histiocytoma|dermatofibromas]], or [[lentigo|lentigines]].

===Biopsy===
Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam,<ref name="dermnetnz.org"/> or ''[[in vivo]]'' diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may [[biopsy]] the suspicious mole. A [[skin biopsy]] performed under [[local anesthesia]] is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by [[histological]] analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as [[skin biopsy#Punch biopsy|punch biopsies]] are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because of the possibility of sampling error<ref name="pmid19155361">{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery BD, Sadler GM | title = Punch biopsy of pigmented lesions is potentially hazardous | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 24; autor reply 24 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19155361 | pmc = 2628830 }}</ref> or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness.<ref name="pmid25827527">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luk PP, Vilain R, Crainic O, McCarthy SW, Thompson JF, Scolyer RA | title = Punch biopsy of melanoma causing tumour cell implantation: another peril of utilising partial biopsies for melanocytic tumours | journal = The Australasian Journal of Dermatology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–231 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25827527 | doi = 10.1111/ajd.12333 | s2cid = 2510803 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22471244">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin SW, Kaye V, Goldfarb N, Rawal A, Warshaw E | title = Melanoma tumor seeding after punch biopsy | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 38 | issue = 7 Pt 1 | pages = 1083–1085 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22471244 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2012.02384.x | s2cid = 3431248 }}</ref> However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.<ref name="pmid16307945">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin RC, Scoggins CR, Ross MI, Reintgen DS, Noyes RD, Edwards MJ, McMasters KM | title = Is incisional biopsy of melanoma harmful? | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 190 | issue = 6 | pages = 913–917 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16307945 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2005.08.020 }}</ref><ref name="pmid24665419">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashita Y, Hashimoto I, Abe Y, Seike T, Okawa K, Senzaki Y, Murao K, Kubo Y, Nakanishi H |  title = Effect of biopsy technique on the survival rate of malignant melanoma patients | journal = Archives of Plastic Surgery | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–125 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24665419 | pmc = 3961608 | doi = 10.5999/aps.2014.41.2.122 }}</ref>

Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes.<ref name="ap01"/> The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

[[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) tests are often used to screen for [[metastasis|metastases]], although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates the metastatic spread of the disease to the liver.

It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases [[computed tomography|CT]], [[MRI]], and/or [[positron emission tomography|PET]] scans. Although controversial, [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsies and examination of the [[lymph node]]s are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the [[S-100 protein]] marker.

[[HMB-45]] is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors. The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.

HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

The body uses UV light to generate [[vitamin D]] so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half-hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn. Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greinert R, de Vries E, Erdmann F, Espina C, Auvinen A, Kesminiene A, Schüz J | title = European Code against Cancer 4th Edition: Ultraviolet radiation and cancer | journal = Cancer Epidemiology | volume = 39 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S75–S83 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26096748 | doi = 10.1016/j.canep.2014.12.014 | hdl-access = free | doi-access = free | hdl = 1765/86460 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Malignant melanoma on chest.jpg|thumb|Extensive malignant melanoma on a person's chest]]
Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a [[skin biopsy]]. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy may be performed. Controversy exists around trial evidence for sentinel lymph node biopsy;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |title=The Sentinel Node Biopsy Procedure in Melanoma does not offer a survival advantage |publisher=Malignant Melanoma |date=8 January 2008 |access-date=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711150413/http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |archive-date=11 July 2012 }}</ref> with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyrgidis A, Tzellos T, Mocellin S, Apalla Z, Lallas A, Pilati P, Stratigos A | title = Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by lymph node dissection for localised primary cutaneous melanoma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2015 | issue = 5 | pages = CD010307 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25978975 | pmc = 6461196 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010307.pub2 }}</ref> Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

===Surgery===

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate [[surgical margin]]s and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a [[wide local excision]] (WLE) with {{convert|1-2|cm|1|abbr=on}} margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually {{convert|0.2-0.5|cm|1|abbr=on}}. Many surgeons consider {{convert|0.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark GS, Pappas-Politis EC, Cherpelis BS, Messina JL, Möller MG, Cruse CW, Glass LF | title = Surgical management of melanoma in situ on chronically sun-damaged skin | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–224 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18596673 | doi = 10.1177/107327480801500304 | doi-access = free }}</ref> but {{convert|0.2|cm|1|abbr=on}} margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery ([[Mohs surgery]], or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Balch CM, Urist MM, Karakousis CP, Smith TJ, Temple WJ, Drzewiecki K, Jewell WR, Bartolucci AA, Mihm MC, Barnhill R |  title = Efficacy of 2-cm surgical margins for intermediate-thickness melanomas (1 to 4 mm).

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the [[lymph nodes]] in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically ([[lymphadenectomy]]) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/surgery/lymph-node-dissection-surgery/ |title=The Screening and Surveillance of Ultrasound in Melanoma trial (SUNMEL) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106181514/http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/surgery/lymph-node-dissection-surgery/ |archive-date=6 January 2009 }}</ref>

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A process called [[lymphoscintigraphy]] is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer [[dye]], and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine [[H&E stain|hematoxylin and eosin]] (H&E) and [[immunoperoxidase]] staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a [[fine-needle aspiration]] biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.

If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional [[skin biopsy]] is the management of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2&nbsp;mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Swanson NA, Lee KK, Gorman A, Lee HN | title = Biopsy techniques. Diagnosis of melanoma | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 677–680 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12380054 | doi = 10.1016/S0733-8635(02)00025-6 }}</ref> To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1&nbsp;mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the [[pathology|histopathologist]] to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by [[Breslow's thickness]] (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5&nbsp;cm, 1.0&nbsp;cm, or 2&nbsp;cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and [[morbidity]] from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

===Add on treatment===
[[adjuvant therapy|Adjuvant treatment]] after surgery may reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery, especially in high-risk melanomas. Routines vary in different countries, but today (2024) the most common adjuvant treatment is immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for up to a year post-surgery.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Daniel |last2=Bello |first2=Danielle M. |date=March 2021 |title=Adjuvant immunotherapy for melanoma |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jso.26329 |journal=Journal of Surgical Oncology |language=en |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=789–797 |doi=10.1002/jso.26329 |pmid=33595889 |s2cid=231943836 |issn=0022-4790}}</ref>

===Lentigo maligna===

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard "bread-loafing" technique of fixed tissue histology – result in a high "false negative" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If [[bread loafing]] is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1&nbsp;mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in-situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment.<ref name="Tzellos_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tzellos T, Kyrgidis A, Mocellin S, Chan AW, Pilati P, Apalla Z | title = Interventions for melanoma in situ, including lentigo maligna | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2016 | issue = 12 | pages = CD010308 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25526608 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010308.pub2 | pmc = 11005944 }}</ref>

Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ ([[lentigo maligna]]) have resolved with an experimental treatment, [[imiquimod]] (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some derma-surgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months. While some studies have suggested the adjuvant use of topical tazarotene, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend it and suggests that it increases topical inflammation, leading to lower patient compliance.<ref name="Tzellos_2014"/>

===Radiation===
[[Radiation therapy]] is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with un-resectable distant metastases.

==Prognosis==

[[File:5YearSurvival2008to14.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|5 year relative survival by stage at diagnosis for melanoma of the skin in the United States as of 2014]]
Factors that affect [[prognosis]] include:
* [[tumor]] thickness in millimeters ([[Breslow's depth]]),
* depth related to skin structures ([[Clark level]]),
* type of melanoma,
* presence of ulceration,
* presence of lymphatic/[[perineural invasion]],
* presence of tumor-infiltrating [[lymphocyte]]s (if present, prognosis is better),
* location of lesion,
* presence of satellite lesions, and
* presence of regional or distant [[metastasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Homsi J, Kashani-Sabet M, Messina JL, Daud A | title = Cutaneous melanoma: prognostic factors | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 223–229 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16258493 | doi = 10.1177/107327480501200403 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their [[Breslow's depth|thickness]]. Less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a [[wide local excision]] (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.

When melanomas have spread to the [[lymph node]]s, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; [[micrometastasis|micrometastases]] in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macro-metastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of malignant melanoma prognosis.<ref name="van_Kempen_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Kempen LC, Redpath M, Robert C, Spatz A | title = Molecular pathology of cutaneous melanoma | journal = Melanoma Management | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–164 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 30190820 | pmc = 6094595 | doi = 10.2217/mmt.14.23 }}</ref><ref name="Brunner13">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner G, Reitz M, Heinecke A, Lippold A, Berking C, Suter L, Atzpodien J | title = A nine-gene signature predicting clinical outcome in cutaneous melanoma | journal = Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–258 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23052696 | doi = 10.1007/s00432-012-1322-z | s2cid = 20257709 }}</ref>

There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g., rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a [[pathology|pathology report]] might indicate.

About 200 genes are prognostic in melanoma, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is correlated to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times. Examples of unfavorable genes are [[MCM6]] and [[timeless (gene)|TIMELESS]]; an example of a favorable gene is [[WIPI1]].<ref name="proteinatlas.org"/><ref name="Uhlen eaan2507"/>

Globally, in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths.<ref name=WCR2014/> Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world.<ref name=WCR2014/> It has become more common in the last 20 years in areas that are mostly [[white people|Caucasian]].<ref name=WCR2014/>

The rate of melanoma has increased in the recent years, but it is not clear to what extent changes in behavior, in the environment, or in early detection are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berwick M, Wiggins C | title = The current epidemiology of cutaneous malignant melanoma | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 11 | pages = 1244–1254 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16368510 | doi = 10.2741/1877 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has a very high – and increasing – rate of melanoma. In 2012, deaths from melanoma occurred in 7.3–9.8 per 100,000 population. In Australia, melanoma is the third most common cancer in either sex; indeed, its incidence is higher than for [[lung cancer]], although the latter accounts for more deaths. It is estimated that in 2012, more than 12,000 Australians were diagnosed with melanoma: given Australia's modest population, this is better expressed as 59.6 new cases per 100,000 population per year; >1 in 10 of all new cancer cases were melanomas.<ref name="aihw2012">{{cite web|url=http://aihw.gov.au/cancer/cancer-in-australia-overview-2012/|title=Cancer in Australia: an overview 2012|publisher=AIHW|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602195619/http://aihw.gov.au/cancer/cancer-in-australia-overview-2012/|archive-date=2 June 2014|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref> Melanoma incidence in Australia is matter of significance, for the following reasons:
* Australian melanoma incidence has increased by more than 30 per cent between 1991 and 2009.
* Australian melanoma age-standardized incidence rates were, as of 2008, at least 12 times higher than the world average.
* Australian melanoma incidence is, by some margin, the highest in the world.
* Overall age-standardized cancer incidence in Australia is the highest in the world, and this is attributable to melanoma alone. Age-standardized overall cancer incidence is similar to New Zealand, but there is a statistically significant difference between Australia and all other parts of the developed world including North America, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean.

In 2013:
* 71,943 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin, including 42,430 men and 29,513 women.
* 9,394 people in the United States died from melanomas of the skin, including 6,239 men and 3,155 women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/|title=CDC – Skin Cancer Statistics|website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214142/https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/|archive-date=10 April 2017}}</ref>
The American Cancer Society's estimates for melanoma incidence in the United States for 2017 are:
* About 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women).
* About 9,730 people are expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women).
Melanoma is more than 20 times more common in whites than in African Americans. Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 2.5% (1 in 40) for whites, 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for African Americans, and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Mexicans.

The risk of melanoma increases as people age. The average age of people when the disease is diagnosed is 63.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|title=Key Statistics for Melanoma Skin Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410135926/https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|archive-date=10 April 2017}}</ref>

==History==

Although melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine [[Peru]]vian mummies, [[radiocarbon]] dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.<ref name="urteaga">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urteaga O, Pack GT | title = On the antiquity of melanoma | journal = Cancer | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 607–610 | date = May 1966 | pmid = 5326247 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(196605)19:5<607::AID-CNCR2820190502>3.0.CO;2-8 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a "cancerous fungous excrescence". The excised tumor was preserved in the [[Hunterian and Wellcome Museums|Hunterian Museum]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma.<ref name="bodenham">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodenham DC | title = A study of 650 observed malignant melanomas in the South-West region | journal = Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–239 | date = October 1968 | pmid = 5698493 | pmc = 2312310 }}</ref>

The French physician [[René Laennec]] was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806.<ref name="laennec">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laennec RT |year= 1806 |title= Sur les melanoses |journal= Bulletin de la Faculté de Médecine de Paris |volume= 1 |pages= 24–26}}</ref>

The first English-language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820.<ref name="norris1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris W | title = Case of Fungoid Disease | journal = Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 65 | pages = 562–565 | date = October 1820 | pmid = 30332089 | pmc = 5830209 }}</ref> In his later work in 1857 he remarked that there is a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (''Eight Cases of [[Melanosis]] with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease''). Norris was also a pioneer in suggesting a link between nevi and melanoma and the possibility of a relationship between melanoma and environmental exposures, by observing that most of his patients had pale complexions.<ref>Norris W. Eight cases of Melanosis with pathological and therapeutical remarks on that disease. London: Longman; 1857.</ref> He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.

The first formal acknowledgment of advanced melanoma as untreatable came from [[Samuel Cooper (surgeon)|Samuel Cooper]] in 1840. He stated that the only chance for a cure depends upon the early removal of the disease (i.e., early excision of the malignant mole) ...'<ref name="cooper">{{cite book| vauthors = Cooper S |title=The First Lines of the Theory and Practice of Surgery: Including the Principle Operations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgE0AQAAMAAJ|year=1844|publisher=S.S. and W.

More than one and a half centuries later this situation remains largely unchanged.

===Terminology===
The word ''melanoma'' came to English from 19th-century [[Neo-Latin]]<ref name="MW_Collegiate">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |author-link=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |access-date=20 July 2018 |archive-date=10 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201010163505/https://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/subscriber/login?redirect_to=%2Fcollegiate%2F |url-status=dead }}</ref> and uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] derived from [[ancient Greek]] roots: ''[[wikt:melano-#Prefix|melano-]]'' (denoting [[melanin]]) + ''[[wikt:-oma#Suffix|-oma]]'' (denoting a tissue mass and especially a [[neoplasm]]), in turn from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μέλας|μέλας]] ''melas'', "dark",<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Liddell HG, Scott R | url = https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Flas | title = μέλας | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183904/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Flas | archive-date = 5 June 2011| work = A Greek-English Lexicon | publisher = Perseus }}</ref> and [[wikt:-ωμα|-ωμα]] ''oma'', "process".

Terms such as "benign [[melanocytic tumor]]" unequivocally label the benign types, and modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.

===BRAF inhibitors===
About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the [[BRAF (gene)|B-Raf gene]]. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's [[vemurafenib]] could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/health/research/22trial.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Roller Coaster Chase for a Cure | vauthors = Harmon A |date=21 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210085433/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/health/research/22trial.html |archive-date=10 February 2017 }}</ref> In June 2011, a large [[clinical trial]] confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.<ref name="studies">{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]| vauthors  = Pollack A |date=5 June 2011|title=Drugs Show Promise Slowing Advanced Melanoma|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/health/research/06melanoma.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131105246/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/health/research/06melanoma.html|archive-date=31 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="pmid21639808">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman PB, Hauschild A, Robert C, Haanen JB, Ascierto P, Larkin J, Dummer R, Garbe C, Testori A, Maio M, Hogg D, Lorigan P, Lebbe C, Jouary T, Schadendorf D, Ribas A, O'Day SJ, Sosman JA, Kirkwood JM, Eggermont AM, Dreno B, Nolop K, Li J, Nelson B, Hou J, Lee RJ, Flaherty KT, McArthur GA |  title = Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 26 | pages = 2507–2516 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21639808 | pmc = 3549296 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1103782 }}</ref>

Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a [[MEK inhibitor]] [[trametinib]] led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median [[progression-free survival]] increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months.

===Ipilimumab===
At the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] Conference in June 2010, the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug [[ipilimumab]]. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bristol drug cuts death risk in advanced melanoma |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218461520100605 |work= Reuters |date= 5 June 2010 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101109095301/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218461520100605 |archive-date= 9 November 2010 }}</ref> However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/06/the-risk-for-bristol/ |title=The Risk For Bristol |work=Forbes |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315041905/http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/06/06/the-risk-for-bristol/ |archive-date=15 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100609/Phase-3-clinical-study-Ipilimumab-boosts-sustains-immune-system-responses-against-melanoma-tumors.aspx |title=Phase 3 clinical study: Ipilimumab boosts, sustains immune system responses against melanoma tumors |publisher=News-medical.net |date=9 June 2010 |access-date=13 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019003945/http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100609/Phase-3-clinical-study-Ipilimumab-boosts-sustains-immune-system-responses-against-melanoma-tumors.aspx |archive-date=19 October 2012 }}</ref> The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.

Ipilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm1193237.htm |title=FDA approves new treatment for a type of late-stage skin cancer | vauthors = Jefferson E |date=25 March 2011 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |access-date=25 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327063147/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm1193237.htm |archive-date=27 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html |title=Approval for Drug That Treats Melanoma | vauthors = Pollack A |date=25 March 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110401011816/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html |archive-date=1 April 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">{{cite web | work = Drugs.com | url = https://www.drugs.com/yervoy.html | title = Yervoy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809231412/http://www.drugs.com/yervoy.html | archive-date=9 August 2011}}</ref>

In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus [[dacarbazine]] combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful of improving the five year survival rate, though serious adverse side-effects were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.<ref name="studies"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robert C, Thomas L, Bondarenko I, O'Day S, Weber J, Garbe C, Lebbe C, Baurain JF, Testori A, Grob JJ, Davidson N, Richards J, Maio M, Hauschild A, Miller WH, Gascon P, Lotem M, Harmankaya K, Ibrahim R, Francis S, Chen TT, Humphrey R, Hoos A, Wolchok JD |  title = Ipilimumab plus dacarbazine for previously untreated metastatic melanoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 26 | pages = 2517–2526 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21639810 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1104621 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Oncolytic virotherapy===
In some countries oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising branch of [[virotherapy]], where [[oncolytic virus]]es are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity and disorganize vasculature.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Forbes NE, Abdelbary H, Lupien M, Bell JC, Diallo JS | title = Exploiting tumor epigenetics to improve oncolytic virotherapy | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 184 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24062768 | pmc = 3778850 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00184 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus type 1–derived oncolytic immunotherapy), was shown to be useful against metastatic melanoma in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andtbacka RH, Kaufman HL, Collichio F, Amatruda T, Senzer N, Chesney J, Delman KA, Spitler LE, Puzanov I, Agarwala SS, Milhem M, Cranmer L, Curti B, Lewis K, Ross M, Guthrie T, Linette GP, Daniels GA, Harrington K, Middleton MR, Miller WH, Zager JS, Ye Y, Yao B, Li A, Doleman S, VanderWalde A, Gansert J, Coffin RS |  title = Talimogene Laherparepvec Improves Durable Response Rate in Patients With Advanced Melanoma | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 25 | pages = 2780–2788 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26014293 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2014.58.3377 | s2cid = 23663167 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Syn2017/>

===Antivirals===
Antiretrovirals have been tested in vitro against melanoma. The rationale behind this lies in their potential to inhibit human endogenous retroviruses, whose activity has been associated with the development of melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa B, Vale N | title = Exploring HERV-K (HML-2) Influence in Cancer and Prospects for Therapeutic Interventions | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 19 | pages = 1615 | date = September 2023 | pmid = 37834078 | doi = 10.3390/ijms25031615 | doi-access = free | pmc = 10572383 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Müller MD, Holst PJ, Nielsen KN | title = A Systematic Review of Expression and Immunogenicity of Human Endogenous Retroviral Proteins in Cancer and Discussion of Therapeutic Approaches | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 1330 | date = January 2022 | pmid = 35163254 | pmc = 8836156 | doi = 10.3390/ijms23031330 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The results on malignant cells have shown moderate efficacy, and further developments are awaited through animal model testing.
