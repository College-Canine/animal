'''Tetanus''', also known as '''lockjaw''', is a [[bacterial infection]] caused by ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' and characterized by [[muscle spasm]]s. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw, and then progress to the rest of the body. Each spasm usually lasts for a few minutes. Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.<ref name="CDC2012Pink" /> Some spasms may be severe enough to [[bone fracture|fracture bones]].<ref name="CDC2013S">{{cite web |date=January 9, 2013 |title=Tetanus Symptoms and Complications |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212225108/http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html |archive-date=12 February 2015 |access-date=12 February 2015 |website=cdc.gov}}</ref> Other symptoms of tetanus may include [[fever]], [[sweating]], [[headache]], [[dysphagia|trouble swallowing]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]].

Tetanus can be prevented by [[immunization]] with the [[tetanus vaccine]]. In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and [[tetanus immune globulin]] are recommended. The wound should be cleaned, and any dead tissue should be removed. In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin, or, if unavailable, [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG) is used.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> [[Muscle relaxant]]s may be used to control spasms. [[Mechanical ventilation]] may be required if a person's breathing is affected.<ref name=CDC2013Doc/>

Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world, but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> In 2015, there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally.<ref name=GBD2015Pre>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vos T, Allen C, Arora M, Barber RM, Bhutta ZA, Brown A, etal | collaboration = GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1545–1602 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733282 | pmc = 5055577 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6 }}</ref><ref name=GBD2015De>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang H, Naghavi M, Allen C, Barber RM, Bhutta ZA, Carter A, etal | collaboration = GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1459–1544 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733281 | pmc = 5388903 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31012-1 }}</ref> This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990.<ref name=GBD2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naghavi M, Wang H, Lozano R, Davis A, Liang X, Zhou M, etal | collaboration = GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 | journal = Lancet | volume = 385 | issue = 9963 | pages = 117–71 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25530442 | pmc = 4340604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2 }}</ref> In the US, there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which were in people who had not been vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Tetanus |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=United States Government |access-date=4 August 2019}}</ref> An early description of the disease was made by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Tetanus often begins with mild [[spasm]]s in the [[Muscles of mastication|jaw muscles]]—also known as lockjaw. Similar spasms can also be a feature of [[trismus]].<ref name="OCF">{{cite web |title=Trismus – The Oral Cancer Foundation |date=19 September 2016 |url=https://oralcancerfoundation.org/complications/trismus/ |access-date=5 April 2022}}</ref> The spasms can also affect the [[facial muscles]], resulting in an appearance called ''[[risus sardonicus]]''. Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, and buttocks may be affected. [[Human back#Muscles|Back muscle]] spasms often cause arching, called [[opisthotonus]]. Sometimes, the spasms affect [[Muscles of respiration|muscles utilized during inhalation and exhalation]], which can lead to breathing problems.<ref name=CDC2020Pink>{{cite web | title=Tetanus - Epidemiology of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | website=CDC | date=2020-05-10 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510154018/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html | archive-date=2020-05-10 | url-status=live | access-date=2020-05-18|quote=Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords) and/or spasm of the muscles of respiration leads to interference with breathing.}}</ref>

Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, called [[tetany]]. These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears. Other symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], restlessness, [[irritability]], feeding difficulties, [[respiratory failure|breathing problems]], [[dysuria|burning sensation during urination]], [[urinary retention]], and [[Fecal incontinence|loss of stool control]].<ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Schleiss MR |title=Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics|editor=Kliegman, Robert |publisher=Elsevier |year=2020|isbn=978-0-323-52950-1 |pages=6253|chapter=Chapter 238: Tetanus}}</ref>

Even with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> The [[mortality rate]] is higher in unvaccinated individuals, and in people over 60 years of age.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

=== Incubation period ===
The [[incubation period]] of tetanus may be up to several months, but is usually about ten days.<ref name="pmid12850356">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vandelaer J, Birmingham M, Gasse F, Kurian M, Shaw C, Garnier S | title = Tetanus in developing countries: an update on the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Initiative | journal = Vaccine | volume = 21 | issue = 24 | pages = 3442–5 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12850356 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(03)00347-5 }}</ref><ref name="pmid12122532">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brauner JS, Vieira SR, Bleck TP | title = Changes in severe accidental tetanus mortality in the ICU during two decades in Brazil | journal = Intensive Care Med | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 930–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12122532 | doi = 10.1007/s00134-002-1332-4 | s2cid = 21772357 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In general, the farther the injury site is from the [[central nervous system]], the longer the incubation period.

On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

=== Generalized tetanus ===
Generalized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases. The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus or lockjaw, then facial spasms (called ''[[risus sardonicus]]),'' followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]] muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated [[blood pressure]], and episodic rapid heart rate. [[Spasm]]s may occur frequently and last for several minutes, with the body shaped into a characteristic form called [[opisthotonos]]. Spasms continue for up to four weeks, and complete recovery may take months.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

=== Neonatal tetanus ===
{{main|Neonatal tetanus}}
Neonatal tetanus (''trismus nascentium'') is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated. If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire [[passive immunity]], and are thus protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/factsheets/tetanus_nt/en/|title=Tetanus and neonatal tetanus (NT)|website=WHO Western Pacific Region|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503223407/http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/factsheets/tetanus_nt/en/|archive-date=2014-05-03}}</ref> It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed [[Umbilical cord|umbilical stump]], particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. As of 1998, neonatal tetanus was common in many [[Developing country|developing countries]], and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths.<ref name="WHO_2000">{{cite web | title=Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination by 2005 | date=November 2000 | publisher=UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/immunization/files/MNTE_strategy_paper.pdf | access-date=2007-01-26 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111051802/http://www.unicef.org/immunization/files/MNTE_strategy_paper.pdf | archive-date=2007-01-11 }}</ref> In 2010, the worldwide death toll was approximately 58,000 newborns. As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013, the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries.<ref name="elimination">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/health/index_43509.html|title=Elimination of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus|work=UNICEF|access-date=17 February 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221230401/http://www.unicef.org/health/index_43509.html|archive-date=21 February 2014}}</ref> Neonatal tetanus is rare in [[Developed country|developed countries]].

=== Local tetanus ===
Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which people have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.<ref name="CDC2012Pink" />

=== Cephalic tetanus ===

== Cause ==
[[File:Clostridium Tetani.svg|thumb|''Clostridium tetani'' is durable due to its [[endospore]]s. Pictured is the bacterium alone, with a spore being produced, and the spore alone.]]

Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium, ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> The disease is an international health problem, as ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' [[endospore]]s are ubiquitous. Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound ([[penetrating trauma]]). Due to ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack [[oxygen]], such as a puncture wound. With the changes in oxygen levels, the drumstick-shaped endospore can quickly spread.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanif H, Anjum A, Ali N, Jamal A, Imran M, Ahmad B, Ali MI | title = Isolation and Antibiogram of Clostridium tetani from Clinically Diagnosed Tetanus Patients | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 752–6 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26175031 | pmc = 4596594 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0040 }}</ref>

[[Manure]]-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals, such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pinkbook: Tetanus {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=28 September 2021 |language=en-us |date=17 August 2021}}</ref>

The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated [[heroin]].<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> Animal bites can transmit tetanus.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

Tetanus is often associated with [[rust]], especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing ''C.&nbsp;tetani'', while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/rusty-nail-tetanus1.htm|title=Causes of Tetanus|website=HowStuffWorks| vauthors = Edmonds M |access-date=9 November 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122031152/http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/rusty-nail-tetanus1.htm|archive-date=22 November 2015|date=2009-07-29}}</ref> An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/themicrobialworld/Tetanus.html|title=Tetanus| vauthors = Todar K |publisher=University of Wisconsin, Madison - Dept. of Bacteriology|work=Lectures in Microbiology|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311070553/http://textbookofbacteriology.net/themicrobialworld/Tetanus.html|archive-date=2013-03-11}}</ref> It is a [[List of common misconceptions|common misconception]] that rust itself is the cause, and that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://nytimes.com/2005/02/22/health/the-claim-stepping-on-a-rusty-nail-can-cause-tetanus.html |title=The Claim: Stepping on a Rusty Nail Can Cause Tetanus | vauthors = O'Connor A |date=February 22, 2005 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref><ref name="Jennings2013">{{cite book|vauthors = Jennings K|title=Because I Said So!: The Truth Behind the Myths, Tales, and Warnings Every Generation Passes Down to Its Kids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udIPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13|date=2013-10-08|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4767-0696-2|pages=13–}}</ref>

Tetanus toxin specifically blocks the release of the neurotransmitters [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[glycine]] from inhibitory neurons. These neurotransmitters keep overactive motor neurons from firing, and also play a role in the relaxation of muscles after contraction. When inhibitory neurons are unable to release their neurotransmitters, motor neurons fire out of control, and muscles have difficulty relaxing. This causes the muscle spasms and [[Spasticity|spastic paralysis]] seen in tetanus infection.<ref name=":0" />

The tetanus toxin, [[tetanospasmin]], is made up of a heavy chain and a light chain. There are three domains, each of which contributes to the pathophysiology of the toxin.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Masuyer G, Conrad J, Stenmark P | title = The structure of the tetanus toxin reveals pH-mediated domain dynamics | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 1306–1317 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28645943 | pmc = 5538627 | doi = 10.15252/embr.201744198 }}</ref> The heavy chain has two of the domains. The N-terminal side of the heavy chain helps with membrane translocation, and the C-terminal side helps the toxin locate the specific receptor site on the correct neuron. The light chain domain cleaves the VAMP protein once it arrives in the inhibitory neuron cytosol.<ref name=":2" />

There are four main steps in tetanus's mechanism of action: binding to the neuron, internalization of the toxin, membrane translocation, and cleavage of the target VAMP.<ref>{{Citation |last=Plumlee |first=Konnie H. |title=Chapter 18 - Biotoxins |date=2004-01-01 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B032301125X500212 |work=Clinical Veterinary Toxicology |pages=98–116 |editor-last=Plumlee |editor-first=Konnie H. |place=Saint Louis |publisher=Mosby |language=en |isbn=978-0-323-01125-9 |access-date=2022-06-21}}</ref>

=== Neurospecific binding ===

The toxin travels from the wound site to the [[neuromuscular junction]] through the bloodstream, where it binds to the [[presynaptic membrane]] of a [[motor neuron]]. The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in the binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct [[glycoprotein]]s and [[glycolipid]]s in the presynaptic membrane. The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an [[Endocytosis|endocytic vesicle]] that will travel down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system. Here, it will be released into the [[synaptic cleft]], and allowed to bind with the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons in a similar manner seen with the binding to the motor neuron.<ref name=":1" />

=== Internalization ===

Tetanus toxin is then internalized again via [[endocytosis]], this time, in an acidic vesicle.<ref name=":2" /> In a mechanism not well understood, [[depolarization]] caused by the firing of the inhibitory neuron causes the toxin to be pulled into the neuron inside vesicles.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

=== Membrane translocation ===

The toxin then needs a way to get out of the vesicle and into the neuron cytosol for it to act on its target. The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] form.<ref name=":1" /> With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin can slide into the vesicle membrane. The toxin forms an [[ion channel]] in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup> ions.<ref name=":0" /> There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin's light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon. It has been proposed that the channel could allow the light chain (unfolded from the low pH environment) to leave through the toxin pore,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beise J, Hahnen J, Andersen-Beckh B, Dreyer F | title = Pore formation by tetanus toxin, its chain, and fragments in neuronal membranes and evaluation of the underlying motifs in the structure of the toxin molecule | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 349 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–73 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8139702 | doi = 10.1007/BF00178208 | s2cid = 9398335 }}</ref> or that the pore could alter the [[electrochemical gradient]] enough, by letting in or out ions, to cause osmotic lysis of the vesicle, spilling the vesicle's contents.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabiaux V, Lorge P, Vandenbranden M, Falmagne P, Ruysschaert JM | title = Tetanus toxin induces fusion and aggregation of lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol at low pH | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 128 | issue = 2 | pages = 840–9 | date = April 1985 | pmid = 3994725 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(85)90123-8 }}</ref>

=== Enzymatic target cleavage ===

The light chain of the tetanus toxin is zinc-dependent [[protease]]. It shares a common zinc protease motif (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His) that researchers hypothesized was essential for target cleavage, until this was more recently confirmed by experiment: when all zinc was removed from the neuron with heavy metal [[Chelation|chelators]], the toxin was inhibited, only to be reactivated when the zinc was added back in.<ref name=":0" /> The light chain binds to VAMP, and cleaves it between Gln<sup>76</sup> and Phe<sup>77</sup>. Without VAMP, vesicles holding the neurotransmitters needed for motor neuron regulation ([[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and glycine) cannot be released, causing the above-mentioned deregulation of motor neurons and muscle tension.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Foran P, Shone CC, Dolly JO | title = Differences in the protease activities of tetanus and botulinum B toxins revealed by the cleavage of vesicle-associated membrane protein and various sized fragments | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 33 | issue = 51 | pages = 15365–74 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7803399 | doi = 10.1021/bi00255a017 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
There are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus. The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms, and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases, and can be isolated from people without tetanus. Laboratory identification of ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' can be demonstrated only by production of [[tetanospasmin]] in mice.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/> Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus if no other diagnosis has been made.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The "spatula test" is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|posterior]] [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect. A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the "spatula"), and a negative test result would normally be a [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] attempting to expel the foreign object. A short report in ''The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'' states that, in an affected subject research study, the spatula test had a high [[Sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]] (zero [[False positives and false negatives|false-positive]] test results) and a high [[Sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]] (94% of infected people produced a positive test).<ref name="AJTMH1995">{{cite journal |title=Short Report: The Spatula Test: A Simple Bedside Test to Diagnose Tetanus |vauthors=Apte NM, Karnad DR |date=October 1995 |volume=53 |issue=4 |journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |pages=386–7 |pmid=7485691 |doi=10.4269/ajtmh.1995.53.386 }}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin. Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.<ref>{{cite web| title = CDC Pink Book Chapter 21: Tetanus| url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html| website = CDC.gov| date = August 2021| access-date = 18 March 2023}}</ref>

Tetanus can be prevented by [[vaccination]] with [[tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid]].<ref name=MMWR_1991>{{cite journal | title = Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis: recommendations for vaccine use and other preventive measures. Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory committee (ACIP) | journal = MMWR.

The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.<ref name="pmid1574917">{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter JD, Perkin MA, Corbel MJ, Farrington CP, Watkins JT, Begg NT | title = Lack of early antitoxin response to tetanus booster | journal = Vaccine | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 334–6 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1574917 | doi = 10.1016/0264-410X(92)90373-R }}</ref>

In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, [[DPT vaccine|DPT/DTaP vaccine]], which also includes vaccines against [[diphtheria]] and [[pertussis]]. For adults and children over seven, the [[DPT_vaccine#Excluding_pertussis|Td vaccine]] (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.<ref name=MMWR_1991 />

The [[World Health Organization]] certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or [[neonatal tetanus]]. Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births. In 1998 in [[Uganda]], 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died. After a major public health effort, Uganda was certified as having eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/uganda/media_9662.html |title=Uganda announces elimination of Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus |access-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211184728/http://www.unicef.org/uganda/media_9662.html |archive-date=2015-02-11 }}</ref>

===Post-exposure prophylaxis===
Tetanus toxoid can be given in case of suspected exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus [[immunoglobulin]] (also called ''tetanus antibodies'' or ''tetanus antitoxin''<ref name=britannica2013/>). It can be given as [[intravenous therapy]] or by [[intramuscular injection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

The guidelines for such events in the United States for people at least 11 years old (and not pregnant) are as follows:<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

=== Severe tetanus ===
Severe cases will require admission to [[intensive care]]. In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:<ref name="World Health Organization"/>
* Human tetanus immunoglobulin injected [[intrathecal]]ly (which increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%).
* [[Tracheotomy]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] for 3 to 4 weeks. Tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway, because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm.
* [[Magnesium sulfate (medical use)|Magnesium sulfate]], as an intravenous infusion, to control spasm and autonomic dysfunction.
* [[Diazepam]] as a continuous IV infusion.
* The [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and [[hypotension]] [[hyperpyrexia]]/[[hypothermia]]), and may require IV [[labetalol]], magnesium, [[clonidine]], or [[nifedipine]].

Drugs, such as diazepam or other [[muscle relaxant]]s, can be given to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to paralyze the person with [[curare]]-like drugs, and use a mechanical ventilator.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

To survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper [[nutrition]] are required. An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150&nbsp;g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach ([[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]]), or through a drip into a vein ([[parenteral nutrition]]). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks, because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve [[axon]] terminals.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The antibiotic of choice is [[metronidazole]]. It can be given as intravenously, by mouth, or by rectum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thwaites|first1=C. Louise|last2=Yen|first2=Lam Minh |editor=J.

== In animals ==

Tetanus is found primarily in goats and sheep. The following are clinical symptoms found in affected goats and sheep. Extended head and neck, tail rigors 
(tail becomes rigid and straight), abnormal gait (walking becomes stiff and abnormal), arched back, stiffness of the jaw muscles, lockjaw,
twitching of eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, difficulty or inability to eat and drink, abdominal bloat, spasms (uncontrolled muscular contractions) before death.  
Death sometimes is due to asphyxiation, secondary to respiratory paralysis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tetanus in Goat and sheep |url=https://bscvet.com/tetanus-in-goat-and-sheep-locked-jaw/ |access-date=2023-07-31 |website=bscvet.com}}</ref>

==History==
Tetanus was well known to ancient civilizations, who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms.<ref name="PMC1073859">{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Notes on tetanus (lockjaw) |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=332 |year=1996 |pmid=8609513 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.60.3.332|pmc=1073859}}</ref> In 1884, [[Arthur Nicolaier]] isolated the [[strychnine]]-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the [[University of Turin]], who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves, and testing their reactions while tetanus was spreading.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

In 1891, [[Clostridium tetani|''C.&nbsp;tetani'']] was isolated from a human victim by [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]], who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific [[antibodies]]. In 1897, [[Edmond Nocard]] showed that tetanus antitoxin induced [[passive immunity]] in humans, and could be used for [[prophylaxis]] and treatment. Tetanus toxoid [[vaccine]] was developed by [[P.&nbsp;Descombey]] in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during [[World War II]].<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>

===Etymology===
The word tetanus comes from the {{lang-grc|τέτανος|tetanos|taut}}, which is further from the {{lang-grc|τείνειν|teinein|to stretch}}.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Tetanus tetanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626182039/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/tetanus |date=2012-06-26 }}.

== Research ==
There is insufficient evidence that tetanus can be treated or prevented by [[vitamin C]]. This is at least partially due to the fact that the historical trials that were conducted in attempts to look for a possible connection between vitamin C and alleviating tetanus patients were of poor quality.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemilä H, Koivula T | title = Vitamin C for preventing and treating tetanus | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 11 | pages = CD006665 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24226506 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006665.pub3 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 10138/225863 }}</ref>
