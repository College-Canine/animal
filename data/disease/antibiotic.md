An '''antibiotic''' is a type of [[antimicrobial]] substance active against [[bacteria]]. It is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infections]], and antibiotic [[medication]]s are widely used in the [[therapy|treatment]] and [[antibiotic prophylaxis|prevention]] of such infections.<ref name="NHSB">{{cite web |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Antibiotics-penicillins/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Antibiotics |publisher=NHS |date=5 June 2014 |access-date=17 January 2015 |archive-date=18 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118023314/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics-penicillins/pages/introduction.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/antibiotics/Pages/factsExperts.aspx |title=Factsheet for experts |publisher=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221183712/http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/antibiotics/Pages/factsExperts.aspx |archive-date=21 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They may either [[bactericide|kill]] or [[bacteriostatic agent|inhibit the growth]] of bacteria.

Sometimes, the term ''antibiotic''—literally "opposing life", from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots ἀντι ''anti'', "against" and βίος ''bios'', "life"—is broadly used to refer to any substance used against [[microbe]]s, but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as [[penicillin]]) are those produced naturally (by one [[microorganism]] fighting another), whereas non-antibiotic antibacterials (such as [[sulfonamide]]s and [[antiseptic]]s) are [[total synthesis|fully synthetic]]. However, both classes have the same goal of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, and both are included in [[antimicrobial chemotherapy]]. "Antibacterials" include [[bactericide]]s, [[bacteriostatic]]s, [[antibacterial soap]]s, and chemical [[disinfectant]]s, whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/agents.shtml#1 |title=General Background: Antibiotic Agents |work=Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics |access-date=21 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214195917/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/agents.shtml#1 |archive-date=14 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[antibiotic use in livestock|sometimes in livestock feed]].

The term ''antibiotic'' was first used in 1942 by [[Selman Waksman]] and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.<ref name="Saxena" /><ref name="Wakeman1947" /> This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juices]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]. In current usage, the term "antibiotic" is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/antimicrobialdru0000scho|title=The Antimicrobial Drugs|vauthors=Scholar EM, Pratt WB|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-512529-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/antimicrobialdru0000scho/page/3 3]|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Davies J, Davies D|date=September 2010|title=Origins and evolution of antibiotic resistance|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=74|issue=3|pages=417–33|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-10|pmc=2937522|pmid=20805405}}</ref>

==Usage==
===Medical uses===
Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections,<ref name=Antibiotic>{{cite book|title=Antibiotics Simplified.|date=2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1459-1|pages=15–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIRgA57q414C&q=Antibiotics|access-date=28 April 2024|archive-date=2 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240102114230/https://books.google.com/books?id=vIRgA57q414C&q=Antibiotics#v=snippet&q=Antibiotics&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> and sometimes [[protozoan infection]]s. ([[Metronidazole]] is effective against a number of [[parasitic disease]]s). When an infection is suspected of being responsible for an illness but the responsible pathogen has not been identified, an [[empiric therapy]] is adopted.<ref name="General principles">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leekha S, Terrell CL, Edson RS | title = General principles of antimicrobial therapy | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–67 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21282489 | pmc = 3031442 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2010.0639 }}</ref> This involves the administration of a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] based on the signs and symptoms presented and is initiated pending laboratory results that can take several days.<ref name="Antibiotic"/><ref name="General principles"/>

When the responsible pathogenic microorganism is already known or has been identified, [[therapy#Definitive therapy|definitive therapy]] can be started. This will usually involve the use of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The choice of antibiotic given will also be based on its cost. Identification is critically important as it can reduce the cost and toxicity of the antibiotic therapy and also reduce the possibility of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.<ref name="General principles"/> To avoid surgery, antibiotics may be given for non-complicated acute [[appendicitis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rollins KE, Varadhan KK, Neal KR, Lobo DN | title = Antibiotics Versus Appendicectomy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 2305–18 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27199000 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-016-3561-7 | s2cid = 4802473 }}</ref>

Antibiotics may be given as a [[preventive healthcare|preventive measure]] and this is usually limited to at-risk populations such as those with a [[immunodeficiency|weakened immune system]] (particularly in [[HIV]] cases to prevent [[pneumonia]]), those taking [[immunosuppressive drug]]s, [[cancer]] patients, and those having [[surgery]].<ref name=Antibiotic/> Their use in surgical procedures is to help prevent infection of [[surgical incision|incisions]]. They have an important role in [[dental antibiotic prophylaxis]] where their use may prevent [[bacteremia]] and consequent [[infective endocarditis]]. Antibiotics are also used to prevent infection in cases of [[neutropenia]] particularly cancer-related.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flowers CR, Seidenfeld J, Bow EJ, Karten C, Gleason C, Hawley DK, Kuderer NM, Langston AA, Marr KA, Rolston KV, Ramsey SD | title = Antimicrobial prophylaxis and outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 794–810 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23319691 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.8661 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bow EJ | title = Infection in neutropenic patients with cancer | journal = Critical Care Clinics | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 411–41 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23830647 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccc.2013.03.002 }}</ref>

===Routes of administration===
There are many different [[routes of administration]] for antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics are usually [[oral administration|taken by mouth]]. In more severe cases, particularly deep-seated [[systemic disease|systemic infections]], antibiotics can be given [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] or by injection.<ref name="NHSB"/><ref name="General principles"/> Where the site of infection is easily accessed, antibiotics may be given [[routes of administration#Topical|topically]] in the form of [[eye drop]]s onto the [[conjunctiva]] for [[conjunctivitis]] or [[ear drop]]s for ear infections and acute cases of [[otitis externa|swimmer's ear]]. Topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including [[acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[cellulitis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pangilinan R, Tice A, Tillotson G | title = Topical antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: review of the literature | journal = Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 957–65 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19803705 | doi = 10.1586/eri.09.74 | s2cid = 207217730 }}</ref> Advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection; reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity, and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced, thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse.<ref name="Treating chronic wounds">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipsky BA, Hoey C | title = Topical antimicrobial therapy for treating chronic wounds | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 1541–9 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19842981 | doi = 10.1086/644732 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> Topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds have been reported to reduce the risk of surgical site infections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heal CF, Banks JL, Lepper PD, Kontopantelis E, van Driel ML | title = Topical antibiotics for preventing surgical site infection in wounds healing by primary intention | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2016 | issue = 11 | pages = CD011426 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27819748 | pmc = 6465080 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011426.pub2 }}</ref> However, there are certain general causes for concern with topical administration of antibiotics. Some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur; the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose, and there is also the possibility of local [[hypersensitivity]] reactions or [[contact dermatitis]] occurring.<ref name="Treating chronic wounds"/> It is recommended to administer antibiotics as soon as possible, especially in life-threatening infections. Many emergency departments stock antibiotics for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hung KK, Lam RP, Lo RS, Tenney JW, Yang ML, Tai MC, Graham CA | title = Cross-sectional study on emergency department management of sepsis | journal = Hong Kong Medical Journal = Xianggang Yi Xue Za Zhi | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 571–578 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30429360 | doi = 10.12809/hkmj177149 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

===Global consumption===
Antibiotic consumption varies widely between countries. The [[WHO]] report on surveillance of antibiotic consumption published in 2018 analysed 2015 data from 65 countries. As measured in defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Mongolia had the highest consumption with a rate of 64.4. Burundi had the lowest at 4.4.

Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and well tolerated.

In cases where antibiotics have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibiotic [[rifampicin]], these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.<ref name="Weaver1999"/> Effects on the [[gut flora|intestinal flora]], which might result in reduced absorption of [[estrogen]]s in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.<ref name="pmid3155374"/><ref name="pmid2256523"/> Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibiotics that are suspected to interact with oral [[contraceptive]]s.<ref name="Weaver1999"/> More studies on the possible interactions between antibiotics and birth control pills (oral contraceptives) are required as well as careful assessment of patient-specific risk factors for potential oral contractive pill failure prior to dismissing the need for backup contraception.<ref name="OC effectiveness"/>

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.<ref name="bmj"/><ref name="antibiotics-and-alcohol"/> While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side effects.<ref name="NHS"/> Therefore, potential risks of side effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore AA, Whiteman EJ, Ward KT | title = Risks of combined alcohol/medication use in older adults | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Pharmacotherapy | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–74 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17608249 | pmc = 4063202 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2007.03.006 }}</ref>

Antibiotics such as [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]], [[cephamandole]], [[latamoxef]], [[cefoperazone]], [[cefmenoxime]], and [[furazolidone]], cause a [[disulfiram]]-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath.<ref name="NHS"/> In addition, the efficacy of doxycycline and [[erythromycin]] succinate may be reduced by alcohol consumption.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Stockley IH |year= 2002 |title= Stockley's Drug Interactions |edition= 6th |location= London |publisher= Pharmaceutical Press}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> Other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound.<ref name="Antibiotics FAQ"/>

==Pharmacodynamics==
{{Main|Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics}}
The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include [[immune system|host defense mechanisms]], the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial.<ref name="Pankey2004"/> The bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells.<ref name="Bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary-phase and nondividing Staphylococcus aureus cells"/> These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection.<ref name="Pankey2004"/><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Pelczar MJ, Chan EC, Krieg NR |year=2010 |contribution=Host-Parasite Interaction; Nonspecific Host Resistance |title=Microbiology Concepts and Applications |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |pages=478–479}}</ref> Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration,<ref name="Rhee2004"/> ''in vitro'' characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.<ref name="Pankey2004"/><ref name="Agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)of antimicrobial substances"/>

===Combination therapy===

In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, [[combination therapy]] (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their [[drug synergy|synergistic]] effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect.<ref name="Antagonism between bacteriostatic">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ocampo PS, Lázár V, Papp B, Arnoldini M, Abel zur Wiesch P, Busa-Fekete R, Fekete G, Pál C, Ackermann M, Bonhoeffer S | title = Antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics is prevalent | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 58 | issue = 8 | pages = 4573–82 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24867991 | pmc = 4135978 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.02463-14 }}</ref><ref name="Bollenbach - interactions">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bollenbach T | title = Antimicrobial interactions: mechanisms and implications for drug discovery and resistance evolution | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 27 | pages = 1–9 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26042389 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2015.05.008 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> [[Fosfomycin]] has the highest number of synergistic combinations among antibiotics and is almost always used as a partner drug.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Antonello RM, Principe L, Maraolo AE, Viaggi V, Pol R, Fabbiani M, Montagnani F, Lovecchio A, Luzzati R, Di Bella S | title = Fosfomycin as Partner Drug for Systemic Infection Management.

However, this can vary depending on the species of bacteria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibiotic+antagonism |title=antagonism |access-date=25 August 2014 |archive-date=26 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115751/http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibiotic+antagonism |url-status=live }}</ref> In general, combinations of a bacteriostatic antibiotic and bactericidal antibiotic are antagonistic.<ref name="Antagonism between bacteriostatic"/><ref name="Bollenbach - interactions"/>

In addition to combining one antibiotic with another, antibiotics are sometimes co-administered with resistance-modifying agents. For example, [[β-lactam antibiotics]] may be used in combination with [[beta-lactamase inhibitor|β-lactamase inhibitor]]s, such as [[clavulanic acid]] or [[sulbactam]], when a patient is infected with a [[Beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]]-producing strain of bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Drawz SM, Bonomo RA | title = Three decades of beta-lactamase inhibitors | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 160–201 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20065329 | pmc = 2806661 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00037-09 }}</ref>

Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their [[mechanism of action]], [[chemical structure]], or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes.<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/> Those that target the bacterial cell wall ([[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s) or the cell membrane ([[polymyxin]]s), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ([[rifamycin]]s, [[lipiarmycin]]s, [[quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]], and [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]) have [[bactericide|bactericidal]] activities, killing the bacteria. [[Protein synthesis inhibitor]]s ([[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamides]], and [[tetracycline]]s) are usually [[bacteriostatic]], inhibiting further growth (with the exception of bactericidal [[aminoglycoside]]s).<ref name="The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease"/> Further categorization is based on their target specificity. "Narrow-spectrum" antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as [[gram-negative]] or [[gram-positive]], whereas [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year break in discovering classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics were introduced to clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic [[lipopeptide]]s (such as [[daptomycin]]), [[glycylcyclines]] (such as [[tigecycline]]), [[oxazolidinone]]s (such as [[linezolid]]), and [[lipiarmycin]]s (such as [[fidaxomicin]]).<ref>{{cite book |vauthors= Cunha BA |title= Antibiotic Essentials |year= 2009 |publisher= Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn= 978-0-7637-7219-2 |page= 180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Srivastava A, Talaue M, Liu S, Degen D, Ebright RY, Sineva E, Chakraborty A, Druzhinin SY, Chatterjee S, Mukhopadhyay J, Ebright YW, Zozula A, Shen J, Sengupta S, Niedfeldt RR, Xin C, Kaneko T, Irschik H, Jansen R, Donadio S, Connell N, Ebright RH | title = New target for inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase: 'switch region' | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 532–43 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21862392 | pmc = 3196380 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.030 }}</ref>

==Production==
{{Main|Production of antibiotics}}

Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the [[aminoglycoside]]s, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], the [[quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]], and the [[oxazolidinone]]s—are produced solely by [[chemical synthesis]].<ref name="Nussbaum2006"/> Many antibacterial compounds are relatively [[small molecule]]s with a [[molecular weight]] of less than 1000 [[dalton (unit)|daltons]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av5SHPiHVcsC&q=oral%20drug%20molecular%20weight%20distribution%20antibiotics&pg=PA800 |title=Antibiotic Discovery and Development |vauthors=Dougherty TJ, Pucci MJ |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |page=800 |isbn=978-1-4614-1400-1 |access-date=28 April 2024 |archive-date=2 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240102114324/https://books.google.com/books?id=av5SHPiHVcsC&q=oral%20drug%20molecular%20weight%20distribution%20antibiotics&pg=PA800#v=snippet&q=oral%20drug%20molecular%20weight%20distribution%20antibiotics&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to [[medicine]] has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of [[bacteria]], production of the active compounds is carried out using [[industrial fermentation|fermentation]], usually in strongly [[wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fedorenko V, Genilloud O, Horbal L, Marcone GL, Marinelli F, Paitan Y, Ron EZ | title = Antibacterial Discovery and Development: From Gene to Product and Back | journal = BioMed Research International | volume = 2015 | pages = 591349 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26339625 | pmc = 4538407 | doi = 10.1155/2015/591349 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

==Resistance==

[[File:Human neutrophil ingesting MRSA.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of a human [[neutrophil]] ingesting [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA)]]

The emergence of [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]] is a common phenomenon mainly caused by the overuse/misuse. It represents a threat to health globally.<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 March 2018 |title=Calls to rein in antibiotic use after study shows 65% increase worldwide |journal=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/26/calls-to-rein-in-antibiotic-use-after-study-shows-65-increase-worldwide |url-status=live |access-date=28 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408063812/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/26/calls-to-rein-in-antibiotic-use-after-study-shows-65-increase-worldwide |archive-date=8 April 2018 |vauthors=Sample I}}</ref>

Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may [[natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.<ref name="Balancing the drug-resistance equation" /> For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].<ref name="Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance" /> Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.<ref name="voanews.com" />

Resistance may take the form of biodegradation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Topp E, Chapman R, Devers-Lamrani M, Hartmann A, Marti R, Martin-Laurent F, Sabourin L, Scott A, Sumarah M | title = Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term Exposure, and Isolation of a Sulfamethazine-degrading sp | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 173–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23673752 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2012.0162 | url = http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610 | access-date = 22 November 2013 | archive-date = 12 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212161710/http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610 | url-status = live }}</ref>
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,<ref name="Witte2004"/> but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Dyer BD |title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8854-2|chapter=Chapter 9, Pathogens|chapter-url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&qid=1305345229&sr=1-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobact0000dyer}}</ref>

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.<ref name="The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?"/>

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms.<ref name="D'Costa2011"/> Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.<ref name="Gladki2013"/>

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.<ref name="Alekshun2007"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawlowski AC, Wang W, Koteva K, Barton HA, McArthur AG, Wright GD | title = A diverse intrinsic antibiotic resistome from a cave bacterium | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13803 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27929110 | pmc = 5155152 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13803 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713803P }}</ref> For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]]. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.<ref name="Alekshun2007"/> Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains.<ref name="Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide-producing organisms"/><ref name="Multidrug Resistance in Bacteria"/> The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal genetic exchange]].<ref name="Witte2004"/> For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via [[plasmids]] that carry these resistance genes.<ref name="Witte2004"/><ref name="Baker2006"/> Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.<ref name="Baker2006"/> Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.<ref name="Baker2006"/>

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as "superbugs", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were, for a while, well controlled.

Per ''The ICU Book'' "The first rule of antibiotics is to try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them."<ref name="Marino"/> Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.<ref name="pmid15993671"/><ref name="Larson2007"/> The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s.<ref name="voanews.com"/><ref name="Hawkey2008"/> Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.<ref name="Hawkey2008"/>

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]].

===Synthetic antibiotics derived from dyes===
[[File:Salvarsan-montage.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Arsphenamine, also known as salvarsan, discovered in 1907 by Paul Ehrlich.]]
Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/> Ehrlich noted certain dyes would colour human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the first synthetic antibacterial [[Organoarsenic chemistry|organoarsenic compound]] [[salvarsan]],<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/><ref name="Limbird2004"/><ref name="Bosch2008"/> now called arsphenamine.
[[File:Paul Ehrlich and Sahachiro Hata.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Ehrlich]] and [[Sahachiro Hata]] ]]
This heralded the era of antibacterial treatment that was begun with the discovery of a series of arsenic-derived synthetic antibiotics by both [[Alfred Bertheim]] and Ehrlich in 1907.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="goodman"/> Ehrlich and Bertheim had experimented with various chemicals derived from dyes to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] in mice and [[spirochaeta]] infection in rabbits. While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and [[Sahachiro Hata]], a Japanese bacteriologist working with Ehrlich in the quest for a drug to treat [[syphilis]], achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments.

[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Penicillin]], discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928]]
Observations about the growth of some microorganisms inhibiting the growth of other microorganisms have been reported since the late 19th century. These observations of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials. [[Louis Pasteur]] observed, "if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics".<ref name="Kingston2008"/>

In 1874, physician Sir [[William Roberts (physician)|William Roberts]] noted that cultures of the mould ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]'' that is used in the making of some types of [[blue cheese]] did not display bacterial contamination.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster W, Raoult A | title = Early descriptions of antibiosis | journal = The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners | volume = 24 | issue = 149 | pages = 889–94 | date = December 1974 | pmid = 4618289 | pmc = 2157443 | quote = the first scientific observations of the antagonistic actions of various micro-organisms were made ... by William Roberts of Manchester (1874) and John Tyndall of London (1876). }}</ref>

In 1897, doctoral student [[Ernest Duchesne]] submitted a dissertation, "{{lang|fr|Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes}}" (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes),<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Duchesne E | translator = Witty M |title= Duchesne's Antagonism between molds and bacteria, an English Colloquial Translation| isbn= 978-1-5498-1696-3|date= 23 September 2017 | publisher = Independently Published }}</ref> the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of moulds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and moulds engage in a perpetual battle for survival.

In 1928, Sir [[Alexander Fleming]] postulated the existence of [[penicillin]], a molecule produced by certain moulds that kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria.

[[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]] and [[Edward Abraham]] succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, [[penicillin G]], in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, [[Norman Heatley]] developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Jones DS, Jones JH|date=1 December 2014|title=Sir Edward Penley Abraham CBE. 10 June 1913 – 9 May 1999|url=http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/5.1|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=60|pages=5–22|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2014.0002|issn=0080-4606| doi-access = free | title-link = doi |access-date=10 May 2017|archive-date=26 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231126055623/http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/5.1|url-status=live}}</ref> and then later confirmed by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic [[sulfonamides]]. (see below) The development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.<ref name="Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes"/> For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1945/summary/ |access-date=13 January 2018 |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1945 |publisher=The Nobel Prize Organization |archive-date=23 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523072137/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1945/summary/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Florey credited [[René Dubos]] with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.<ref name=Epps2006/> In 1939, coinciding with the start of [[World War II]], Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[tyrothricin]], a compound of 20% [[gramicidin]] and 80% [[tyrocidine]], from ''Bacillus brevis''. It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II.<ref name="Epps2006"/> Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and the [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II and limited access during the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Capocci M | title = Cold drugs.

During the mid-20th century, the number of new antibiotic substances introduced for medical use increased significantly. From 1935 to 1968, 12 new classes were launched.

Natural products may be screened for the ability to suppress bacterial [[virulence factor]]s too. Virulence factors are molecules, cellular structures and regulatory systems that enable bacteria to evade the body's immune defenses (e.g. [[urease]], [[staphyloxanthin]]), move towards, attach to, and/or invade human cells (e.g. [[type IV pili]], [[Bacterial adhesin|adhesin]]s, [[internalin]]s), coordinate the activation of virulence genes (e.g. [[quorum sensing]]), and cause disease (e.g. [[exotoxin]]s).<ref name="pmid31295426 ">{{cite journal | vauthors = Theuretzbacher U, Piddock LJ | title = Non-traditional Antibacterial Therapeutic Options and Challenges | journal = Cell Host & Microbe | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–72 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31295426 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2019.06.004 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref><ref name="Monte"/><ref name="pmid21514796">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cushnie TP, Lamb AJ | title = Recent advances in understanding the antibacterial properties of flavonoids | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–107 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21514796 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.02.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1003263 | access-date = 19 July 2019 | archive-date = 26 July 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200726062743/https://zenodo.org/record/1003263 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="pmid31410034"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mok N, Chan SY, Liu SY, Chua SL | title = Vanillin inhibits PqsR-mediated virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | journal = Food & Function | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 6496–6508 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32697213 | doi = 10.1039/D0FO00046A | hdl = 10397/88306 | s2cid = 220699939 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Examples of natural products with antivirulence activity include the flavonoid [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (which inhibits [[listeriolysin O]]),<ref name="pmid21514796"/> the [[quinone]] tetrangomycin (which inhibits staphyloxanthin),<ref name="pmid31410034">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue L, Chen YY, Yan Z, Lu W, Wan D, Zhu H | title = Staphyloxanthin: a potential target for antivirulence therapy | journal = Infection and Drug Resistance | volume = 12 | pages = 2151–2160 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31410034 | pmc = 6647007 | doi = 10.2147/IDR.S193649 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> and the [[sesquiterpene]] zerumbone (which inhibits ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' [[Bacteria#Movement|motility]]).<ref name="pmid32463353">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim HR, Shin DS, Jang HI, Eom YB | title = Anti-biofilm and anti-virulence effects of zerumbone against ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' | journal = Microbiology | volume = 166 | issue = 8 | pages = 717–726 | date = August 2020 | pmid = 32463353 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.000930 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

==== Immunoglobulin therapy ====
{{Main|Monoclonal antibody therapy}}
Antibodies ([[anti-tetanus immunoglobulin]]) have been used in the treatment and prevention of [[tetanus]] since the 1910s,<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA, Offit PA |author-link2=Walter Orenstein |author-link1=Stanley Plotkin |author-link3=Paul Offit|title=Vaccines|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4557-0090-5|pages=103, 757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoigDQ6vdDQC&pg=PA103|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021821/https://books.google.ca/books?id=hoigDQ6vdDQC&pg=PA103|archive-date=9 January 2017}}</ref> and this approach continues to be a useful way of controlling bacterial diseases. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[bezlotoxumab]], for example, has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] and [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] for recurrent [[Clostridium difficile infection|''Clostridium difficile'' infection]], and other monoclonal antibodies are in development (e.g. AR-301 for the adjunctive treatment of ''S. aureus'' [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]]). Antibody treatments act by binding to and neutralizing bacterial exotoxins and other virulence factors.<ref name="pmid31295426"/><ref name="pmid30683453"/>

==== Phage therapy ====
{{Main|Phage therapy}}
[[Image: Phage injecting its genome into bacteria.svg|thumb|upright=0.74|right| Phage injecting its genome into a bacterium. Viral replication and bacterial cell lysis will ensue.<ref name=Sulakvelidze/>]]
[[Phage therapy]] is under investigation as a method of treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy involves infecting bacterial pathogens with [[virus]]es. [[Bacteriophage]]s and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus, unlike antibiotics, they do not disturb the host organism's [[intestinal microbiota]].<ref name="Gill, Franco, Hancock"/> Bacteriophages, also known as phages, infect and kill bacteria primarily during lytic cycles.<ref name="Gill, Franco, Hancock"/><ref name=Sulakvelidze>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sulakvelidze A, Alavidze Z, Morris JG | title = Bacteriophage therapy | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 649–59 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11181338 | pmc = 90351 | doi = 10.1128/aac.45.3.649-659.2001 }}</ref> Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage that are able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain.<ref name=Sulakvelidze/> The high specificity of phage protects [[Mutualism (biology)|"good"]] bacteria from destruction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunne M, Rupf B, Tala M, Qabrati X, Ernst P, Shen Y, Sumrall E, Heeb L, Plückthun A, Loessner MJ, Kilcher S | title = Reprogramming Bacteriophage Host Range through Structure-Guided Design of Chimeric Receptor Binding Proteins | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 1336–1350.e4 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31665644 | s2cid = 204967212 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.062 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi | hdl = 20.500.11850/374453 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

Some disadvantages to the use of bacteriophages also exist, however. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and, prior to use, it may be prudent to identify genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing. In addition, the oral and [[intravenous|IV]] administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application. Also, there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==== Fecal microbiota transplants ====

Fecal microbiota transplants involve transferring the full [[intestinal microbiota]] from a healthy human donor (in the form of [[feces|stool]]) to patients with [[Clostridium difficile infection|''C. difficile'' infection]]. Although this procedure has not been officially approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]], its use is permitted under some conditions in patients with antibiotic-resistant ''C. difficile'' infection. Cure rates are around 90%, and work is underway to develop stool [[biobank|banks]], standardized products, and methods of [[Oral administration|oral delivery]].<ref name="pmid31295426"/> Fecal microbiota transplantation has also been used more recently for inflammatory bowel diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Odorico I, Di Bella S, Monticelli J, Giacobbe DR, Boldock E, Luzzati R | title = Role of fecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease | journal = Journal of Digestive Diseases | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 322–334 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29696802 | doi = 10.1111/1751-2980.12603 | s2cid = 24461869 }}</ref>

==== Antisense RNA-based treatments ====
{{see| Antisense RNA }}
Antisense RNA-based treatment (also known as gene silencing therapy) involves (a) identifying bacterial [[gene]]s that encode essential [[protein]]s (e.g. the ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' genes ''acpP'', ''lpxC'', and ''rpsJ''), (b) synthesizing single stranded [[RNA]] that is complementary to the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] encoding these essential proteins, and (c) delivering the single stranded RNA to the infection site using cell-penetrating peptides or [[liposome]]s. The antisense RNA then [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridizes]] with the bacterial mRNA and blocks its [[Translation (biology)|translation]] into the essential protein. Antisense RNA-based treatment has been shown to be effective in ''in vivo'' models of ''P. aeruginosa'' [[lung infection|pneumonia]].<ref name="pmid31295426"/><ref name="pmid30683453"/>

In addition to silencing essential bacterial genes, antisense RNA can be used to silence bacterial genes responsible for antibiotic resistance.<ref name="pmid31295426"/><ref name="pmid30683453"/> For example, antisense RNA has been developed that silences the ''S. aureus'' ''[[mecA]]'' gene (the gene that encodes modified [[penicillin-binding protein]] 2a and renders ''S. aureus'' strains [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant]]). Antisense RNA targeting ''mecA'' mRNA has been shown to restore the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to [[oxacillin]] in both ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' studies.<ref name="pmid30683453"/>

==== CRISPR-Cas9-based treatments ====
In the early 2000s, a system was discovered that enables bacteria to defend themselves against invading viruses. The system, known as CRISPR-Cas9, consists of (a) an enzyme that destroys DNA (the [[nuclease]] [[Cas9]]) and (b) the DNA sequences of previously encountered viral invaders ([[CRISPR]]). These viral DNA sequences enable the nuclease to target foreign (viral) rather than self (bacterial) DNA.<ref name="pmid29358495">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Krupovic M, Forterre P | title = History of CRISPR-Cas from Encounter with a Mysterious Repeated Sequence to Genome Editing Technology | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 200 | issue = 7 | pages = e00580-17 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29358495 | pmc = 5847661 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00580-17 }}</ref>

Although the function of CRISPR-Cas9 in nature is to protect bacteria, the DNA sequences in the CRISPR component of the system can be modified so that the Cas9 nuclease targets bacterial [[antimicrobial resistance|resistance]] genes or bacterial [[virulence]] genes instead of viral genes. The modified CRISPR-Cas9 system can then be administered to bacterial pathogens using plasmids or bacteriophages.<ref name="pmid31295426"/><ref name="pmid30683453"/> This approach has successfully been used to [[Gene silencing|silence]] antibiotic resistance and reduce the virulence of [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'']] in an ''in vivo'' model of infection.<ref name="pmid30683453"/>

==== Vaccines ====
[[Vaccine]]s rely on [[immune]] modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of [[macrophages]], the production of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[inflammation]], and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.<ref>{{cite book |title= Emerging trends in antibacterial discovery: answering the call to arms |publisher= Horizon Scientific Press |year= 2011 | vauthors = Donald RG, Anderson AS | veditors = Miller PF |chapter= Current strategies for antibacterial vaccine development |page= 283}}</ref> Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors= Miller AA |veditors= Miller PF |year=2011 |title=Emerging trends in antibacterial discovery: answering the call to arms |publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] |isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>
