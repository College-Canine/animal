'''Cortisol''' is a [[steroid hormone]], in the [[glucocorticoid]] class of hormones and a [[stress hormone]]. When used as a medication, it is known as [[hydrocortisone]].

It is produced in many animals, mainly by the ''[[zona fasciculata]]'' of the [[adrenal cortex]] in the [[adrenal gland]].<ref name="light">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lightman SL, Birnie MT, Conway-Campbell BL | title = Dynamics of ACTH and Cortisol Secretion and Implications for Disease | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 32060528 | pmc = 7240781 | doi = 10.1210/endrev/bnaa002 }}</ref> It is produced in other tissues in lower quantities.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Taves MD, Gomez-Sanchez CE, Soma KK |title = Extra-adrenal glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids: evidence for local synthesis, regulation, and function |journal = American Journal of Physiology.

=== Metabolic response ===

==== Metabolism of glucose ====

Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and promotes [[gluconeogenesis]] ([[glucose]] synthesis) and [[glycogenesis]] ([[glycogen]] synthesis) in the liver and [[glycogenolysis]] (breakdown of [[glycogen]]) in skeletal muscle.<ref name=light/> It also increases blood glucose levels by reducing glucose uptake in muscle and [[adipose]] tissue, decreasing protein synthesis, and increasing the breakdown of fats into fatty acids (lipolysis). All of these metabolic steps have the net effect of increasing blood glucose levels, which fuel the brain and other tissues during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is also responsible for releasing amino acids from muscle, providing a substrate for [[gluconeogenesis]].<ref name=light/> Its impact is complex and diverse.<ref name="pmid11724664">{{cite journal |vauthors=Khani S, Tayek JA |title=Cortisol increases gluconeogenesis in humans: its role in the metabolic syndrome |journal=Clin Sci (Lond) |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=739–47 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11724664 |doi=10.1042/cs1010739 |url=http://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-pdf/101/6/739/482314/cs1010739.pdf |access-date=2 February 2024 |archive-date=11 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240311202019/https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/101/6/739/67449/Cortisol-increases-gluconeogenesis-in-humans-its?redirectedFrom=PDF |url-status=live }}</ref>

In general, cortisol stimulates [[gluconeogenesis]] (the synthesis of 'new' glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which occurs mainly in the [[liver]], but also in the [[kidney]]s and [[small intestine]] under certain circumstances). The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to [[insulin]], thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as [[glucagon]] and [[adrenaline]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Integrated endocrinology| vauthors = Laycock JF |date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Meeran, Karim.|isbn=978-1-118-45064-2|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=794973804}}</ref>

Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle [[glycogenolysis]] (the breaking down of [[glycogen]] to [[glucose-1-phosphate]] and glucose) which occurs as a result of the action of glucagon and adrenaline. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of [[glycogen phosphorylase]], which is necessary for adrenaline to have an effect on glycogenolysis.<ref name="Martin_2003" /><ref name="pmid1905485">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coderre L, Srivastava AK, Chiasson JL | title = Role of glucocorticoid in the regulation of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 260 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = E927–32 | date = June 1991 | pmid = 1905485 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.1991.260.6.E927}}</ref>

It is paradoxical that cortisol promotes not only [[gluconeogenesis]] (biosythesis of glucose molecules) in the liver, but also [[glycogenesis]] ([[polymerization]] of glucose molecules into [[glycogen]]): cortisol is thus better thought of as stimulating glucose/glycogen turnover in the liver.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Macfarlane DP, Forbes S, Walker BR | title = Glucocorticoids and fatty acid metabolism in humans: fuelling fat redistribution in the metabolic syndrome |language=en-US| journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 197 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–204 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18434349 | doi = 10.1677/JOE-08-0054 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This is in contrast to cortisol's effect in the skeletal muscle where [[glycogenolysis]] (breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules) is promoted indirectly through [[catecholamines]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kuo T, McQueen A, Chen TC, Wang JC | title = Glucocorticoid Signaling | chapter = Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis by Glucocorticoids | volume = 872 | pages = 99–126 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26215992 | pmc = 6185996 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-2895-8_5 | isbn = 978-1-4939-2895-8 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | veditors = Wang JC, Harris C| publisher = Springer }}</ref> In this way, cortisol and catecholamines work synergistically to promote the breakdown of muscle glycogen into glucose for use in the muscle tissue. <ref name="pmid10769296">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sluiter JK, Frings-Dresen MH, Meijman TF, van der Beek AJ |title=Reactivity and recovery from different types of work measured by catecholamines and cortisol: a systematic literature overview |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=298–315 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10769296 |pmc=1739955 |doi=10.1136/oem.57.5.298 |url=}}</ref>

==== Metabolism of proteins and lipids ====
Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to [[proteolysis]] (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simmons PS, Miles JM, Gerich JE, Haymond MW | title = Increased proteolysis. An effect of increases in plasma cortisol within the physiologic range | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 412–20 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6365973 | pmc = 425032 | doi = 10.1172/JCI111227 }}</ref> The reason for proteolysis is to provide the relevant tissue with a feedstock for gluconeogenesis; see [[glucogenic amino acid]]s.<ref name=":0" /> The effects of cortisol on lipid metabolism are more complicated since [[lipogenesis]] is observed in patients with chronic, raised circulating glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) levels,<ref name=":0" /> although an acute increase in circulating cortisol promotes [[lipolysis]].<ref name="pmid12067858">{{cite journal|vauthors=Djurhuus CB, Gravholt CH, Nielsen S, Mengel A, Christiansen JS, Schmitz OE, Møller N|s2cid=2609285|date=July 2002|title=Effects of cortisol on lipolysis and regional interstitial glycerol levels in humans|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=283|issue=1|pages=E172–7|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00544.2001|pmid=12067858}}</ref> The usual explanation to account for this apparent discrepancy is that the raised blood glucose concentration (through the action of cortisol) will stimulate [[insulin]] release. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, so this is an indirect consequence of the raised cortisol concentration in the blood but it will only occur over a longer time scale.

=== Immune response ===
Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause [[inflammation]]. It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and [[rheumatoid]] diseases, as well as [[Allergy|allergies]]. Low-dose [[topical hydrocortisone]], available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as [[rashes]] and [[eczema]].

Cortisol inhibits production of [[interleukin 12]] (IL-12), [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-gamma), [[IFN-α|IFN-alpha]], and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-alpha) by [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs) and [[T helper cell]]s (Th1 cells), but upregulates [[interleukin 4]], [[interleukin 10]], and [[interleukin 13]] by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elenkov IJ | title = Glucocorticoids and the Th1/Th2 balance | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1024 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–46 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15265778 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1321.010 | bibcode = 2004NYASA1024..138E | s2cid = 9575617 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1235876 | access-date = 11 September 2018 | archive-date = 11 December 2022 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20221211215505/https://zenodo.org/record/1235876 | url-status = live }}</ref>

Cortisol can weaken the activity of the [[immune system]]. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the [[interleukin-2]] producer [[T-cell]]s unresponsive to [[interleukin-1]], and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor IL-2. Cortisol downregulates the expression of the IL2 receptor IL-2R on the surface of the helper T-cell which is necessary to induce a Th1 'cellular' immune response, thus favoring a shift towards Th2 dominance and the release of the cytokines listed above which results in Th2 dominance and favors the 'humoral' B-cell mediated antibody immune response.<ref name="pmid6461917">{{cite journal | vauthors = Palacios R, Sugawara I | title = Hydrocortisone abrogates proliferation of T cells in autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction by rendering the interleukin-2 Producer T cells unresponsive to interleukin-1 and unable to synthesize the T-cell growth factor | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–31 | date = January 1982 | pmid = 6461917 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1982.tb00618.x | s2cid = 41292936 }}</ref>

Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on IL-1.<ref name="Besedovsky_1986">{{cite book |vauthors=Besedovsky HO, Del Rey A, Sorkin E | chapter = Integration of Activated Immune Cell Products in Immune Endocrine Feedback Circuits |veditors=Oppenheim JJ, Jacobs DM | title = Leukocytes and Host Defense | series = Progress in Leukocyte Biology | volume = 5 | publisher = Alan R. Liss | location = New York | year = 1986 | page = 200 }}</ref>
The way this negative feedback works is that an immune stressor causes peripheral immune cells to release IL-1 and other [[cytokines]] such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to release [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the production of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) among other things in the adrenal gland, which (among other things) increases production of cortisol. Cortisol then closes the loop as it inhibits TNF-alpha production in immune cells and makes them less responsive to IL-1.<ref name="Tietz_2008">{{cite book |vauthors=Demers Lawrence M | chapter = Adrenal Cortical Disorders |veditors=Burtis Carl A, Ashwood Edward R, Bruns David E, Sawyer, Barbara G| title = Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry | publisher = Saunders El Sevier | location = St. Louis, Missouri | year = 2008 | pages = 749–765 }}</ref>

Through this system, as long as an immune stressor is small, the response will be regulated to the correct level. Like a thermostat controlling a heater, the hypothalamus uses cortisol to turn off the heat once the production of cortisol matches the stress induced on the immune system. But in a severe infection or in a situation where the immune system is overly sensitized to an antigen (such as in [[allergic reactions]]) or there is a massive flood of antigens (as can happen with [[endotoxic]] bacteria) the correct set point might never be reached. Also because of downregulation of Th1 immunity by cortisol and other [[Cell signaling|signaling molecules]], certain types of infection, (notably [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]) can trick the body into getting locked in the wrong mode of attack, using an antibody-mediated humoral response when a cellular response is needed.

[[Lymphocytes]] include the B-cell lymphocytes that are the antibody-producing cells of the body, and are thus the main agents of [[humoral immunity]]. A larger number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin means the body is increasing its humoral immune response. B-cell lymphocytes release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies lower infection through three main pathways: neutralization, [[opsonin|opsonization]], and [[Complement system|complement activation]]. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by binding to surface adhering proteins, keeping pathogens from binding to host cells. In opsonization, antibodies bind to the pathogen and create a target for phagocytic immune cells to find and latch onto, allowing them to destroy the pathogen more easily. Finally antibodies can also activate complement molecules which can combine in various ways to promote opsonization or even act directly to lyse a bacteria. There are many different kinds of antibody and their production is highly complex, involving several types of lymphocyte, but in general lymphocytes and other antibody regulating and producing cells will migrate to the lymph nodes to aid in the release of these antibodies into the bloodstream.<ref name="Janeway_2012">{{cite book |vauthors=Murphy, Kenneth| chapter = The Humoral Immune Response | title = Janeway's Immunobiology, 8th ed.| publisher = Garland Science Taylor & Francis Group | location = New York,NY | year = 2012 | page = 387 }}</ref>

Rapid administration of [[corticosterone]] (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or [[RU28362]] (a specific type II receptor agonist) to [[Adrenalectomy|adrenalectomized]] animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution.

On the other side of things, there are [[natural killer cell]]s; these cells have the ability to take down larger in size threats like bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells. A separate study<ref name="pmid15654827">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mavoungou E, Bouyou-Akotet MK, Kremsner PG | title = Effects of prolactin and cortisol on natural killer (NK) cell surface expression and function of human natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30) | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–96 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15654827 | pmc = 1809301 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2004.02686.x }}</ref> found that cortisol effectively disarmed natural killer cells, downregulating the expression of their natural cytotoxicity receptors. Interestingly, [[prolactin]] has the opposite effect. It increases the expression of cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer cells, increasing their firepower.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), including [[lysyl oxidase]], an enzyme that cross-links [[collagen]] and [[elastin]]. Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the [[superoxide dismutase]],<ref name="isbn0-12-642760-7">{{cite book |vauthors=Flohe L, Beckman R, Giertz H, Loschen G | chapter = Oxygen Centered Free Radicals as Mediators of Inflammation | editor = Sies H | title = Oxidative stress | publisher = Orlando | location = London | year = 1985 | page = 405 | isbn = 978-0-12-642760-8 }}</ref> since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria.

Some viruses, such as [[influenza]] and [[SARS-CoV-1]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]], are known to suppress the secretion of stress hormones to avoid the organism's immune response, thus avoiding the immune protection of the organism. These viruses suppress cortisol by producing a protein that mimics the human ACTH hormone but is incomplete and does not have hormonal activity. ACTH is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and other steroid hormones. However, the organism makes antibodies against this viral protein, and those antibodies also kill the human ACTH hormone, which leads to the suppression of adrenal gland function. Such adrenal suppression is a way for a virus to evade immune detection and elimination.<ref name="cancer2019">{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/cncr.31943 | title=The impact of psychosocial stress and stress management on immune responses in patients with cancer | date=2019 | last1=Antoni | first1=Michael H. | last2=Dhabhar | first2=Firdaus S. | journal=Cancer | volume=125 | issue=9 | pages=1417–1431 | pmid=30768779 | pmc=6467795 }}</ref><ref name="pmid32346813">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pal R |title=COVID-19, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and clinical implications |journal=Endocrine |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=251–252 |date=May 2020 |pmid=32346813 |pmc=7186765 |doi=10.1007/s12020-020-02325-1 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid33542545">{{cite journal |vauthors=Akbas EM, Akbas N |title=COVID-19, adrenal gland, glucocorticoids, and adrenal insufficiency |journal=Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub |volume=165 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |date=March 2021 |pmid=33542545 |doi=10.5507/bp.2021.011 |url=|doi-access=free }}</ref> This viral strategy can have severe consequences for the host (human that is infected by the virus), as cortisol is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, and immune response.

Adrenal insufficiency can also impair the ability of the host to cope with stress and infections, as cortisol helps to mobilize energy sources, increase heart rate, and downregulate non-essential metabolic processes during stress.

==== Bone and collagen ====
Cortisol reduces bone formation,<ref name="pmid6690287"/> favoring long-term development of [[osteoporosis]] (progressive bone disease). The mechanism behind this is two-fold: cortisol stimulates the production of [[RANKL]] by [[osteoblast]]s which stimulates, through binding to [[RANK]] receptors, the activity of [[osteoclast]]s – cells responsible for calcium resorption from bone – and also inhibits the production of [[osteoprotegerin]] (OPG) which acts as a decoy receptor and captures some RANKL before it can activate the osteoclasts through RANK.<ref name=":0" /> In other words, when RANKL binds to OPG, no response occurs as opposed to the binding to RANK which leads to the activation of osteoclasts.

It transports [[potassium]] out of cells in exchange for an equal number of [[sodium]] ions (see above).<ref name="pmid13233328" /> This can trigger the [[hyperkalemia]] of [[Shock (circulatory)#Other proposed types of shock|metabolic shock]] from surgery.

=== Effects during pregnancy ===
During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung [[pulmonary surfactant]] to promote maturation of the lungs.

Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In [[marmoset]]s, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants were more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre and postnatal growth in primates.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Mustoe AC, Birnie AK, Korgan AC, Santo JB, French JA |title = Natural variation in gestational cortisol is associated with patterns of growth in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix geoffroyi) |journal = General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume = 175 |issue = 3 |pages = 519–26 |date = February 2012 |pmid = 22212825 |pmc = 3268124 |doi = 10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.12.020 }}</ref>

==Synthesis and release==
Cortisol is produced in the human body by the [[adrenal gland]] in the [[zona fasciculata]], the second of three layers comprising the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref name=light/> The cortex forms the outer "bark" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain. The secretion of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] by the hypothalamus triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex.<ref name=light/> ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]].<ref name=light/>

== Testing of individuals ==
Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species). Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type, analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result.<ref name="pmid31012054">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bianchi L, Campi B, Sessa MR, De Marco G, Ferrarini E, Zucchi R, Marcocci C, Vitti P, Manetti L, Saba A, Agretti P |title=Measurement of urinary free cortisol by LC-MS-MS: adoption of a literature reference range and comparison with our current immunometric method |journal=J Endocrinol Invest |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=1299–1305 |date=November 2019 |pmid=31012054 |doi=10.1007/s40618-019-01050-5 |s2cid=128361547 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid31161807">{{cite journal |vauthors=Panton KK, Mikkelsen G, Irgens WØ, Hovde AK, Killingmo MW, Øien MA, Thorsby PM, Åsberg A |title=New reference intervals for cortisol, cortisol binding globulin and free cortisol index in women using ethinyl estradiol |journal=Scand J Clin Lab Invest |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=314–319 |date=September 2019 |pmid=31161807 |doi=10.1080/00365513.2019.1622031 |s2cid=174806302 |url=|doi-access=free |hdl=11250/2739760 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref name="pmid37501014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pai J, Joshi RK, Bhaskar S, Patil S, Bv S, R S, Iyengar AR, Agarwal N, Shorie M |title=Revisiting the cortisol reference ranges in humans: the role of demographics |journal=Endocrine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=414–418 |date=November 2023 |pmid=37501014 |doi=10.1007/s12020-023-03456-x |s2cid=260246830 |url=https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2840050/latest.pdf |access-date=2 February 2024 |archive-date=3 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203012804/https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2840050/latest.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> An individual's cortisol levels can be detected in blood, serum, urine, saliva, and sweat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yeasmin |first1=Sanjida |last2=Ullah |first2=Ahasan |last3=Wu |first3=Bo |last4=Zhang |first4=Xueqiao |last5=Cheng |first5=Li-Jing |title=Enzyme-Mimics for Sensitive and Selective Steroid Metabolite Detection |journal=ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces |date=2023 |volume=15 |issue=11 |doi=10.1021/acsami.2c21980 |pmid=36908226 |s2cid=257494057 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c21980 |access-date=8 April 2023 |url-access=subscription |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408234418/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c21980 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the [[anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] of the [[pituitary gland]] with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC ([[side-chain cleavage enzyme]]).<ref name="Margioris_Tsatsanis_2011">{{cite book | vauthors = Margioris AN, Tsatsanis C | veditors = Chrousos G | title = Adrenal physiology and diseases | year = 2011 | chapter = ACTH Action on the Adrenal | chapter-url = http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenalframe5.htm | publisher = Endotext.org | access-date = 5 June 2012 | archive-date = 29 November 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111129102929/http://www.endotext.org/adrenal/adrenal5/adrenalframe5.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref>

* 11-beta HSD2 uses the cofactor NAD+ to convert cortisol to cortisone

Overall, the net effect is that 11-beta HSD1 serves to increase the local concentrations of biologically active cortisol in a given tissue; 11-beta HSD2 serves to decrease local concentrations of biologically active cortisol. If hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) is present, the equilibrium can favor the activity of 11-beta HSD1. H6PDH regenerates NADPH, which increases the activity of 11-beta HSD1, and decreases the activity of 11-beta HSD2.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Atanasov AG, Nashev LG, Schweizer RA, Frick C, Odermatt A | title = Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase determines the reaction direction of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 as an oxoreductase | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 571 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 129–133 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15280030 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.06.065 | s2cid = 6360244 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
