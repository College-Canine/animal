In normal eyesight, while the [[head]] rotates about an [[Axis of rotation|axis]], distant visual images are sustained by rotating eyes in the opposite direction of the respective axis.<ref name="TYH">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003037|Nystagmus}}</ref> The [[semicircular canals]] in the [[vestibule of the ear]] sense angular acceleration, and send signals to the nuclei for eye movement in the brain. From here, a signal is relayed to the [[extraocular muscles]] to allow one's gaze to fix on an object as the head moves. Nystagmus occurs when the [[semicircular canals]] are stimulated (e.g., by means of the [[caloric test]], or by disease) while the head is stationary. The direction of ocular movement is related to the semicircular canal that is being stimulated.<ref name="Higaki">{{cite book |title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function | vauthors = Saladin K |isbn=978-0-07-337825-1 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill  |year=2012 |pages=597–609}}</ref>

There are two key forms of nystagmus: [[pathology|pathological]] and [[physiology|physiological]], with variations within each type. Nystagmus may be caused by [[congenital disorder]] or [[sleep deprivation]], acquired or [[central nervous system]] disorders, [[toxicity]], [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], or rotational movement. Previously considered untreatable, in recent years several drugs have been identified for treatment of nystagmus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowe FJ, Hanna K, Evans JR, Noonan CP, Garcia-Finana M, Dodridge CS, Howard C, Jarvis KA, MacDiarmid SL, Maan T, North L, Rodgers H | title = Interventions for eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | issue = 3 | pages = CD011290 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29505103 | pmc = 6494416 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011290.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref> Nystagmus is also occasionally associated with [[vertigo]].

==Causes==
[[File:OcularAlbanism.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Nystagmus as seen in a case of [[ocular albinism]]]]

The cause of pathological nystagmus may be [[congenital]], [[idiopathic]], or secondary to a pre-existing [[neurological disorder]]. It also may be induced temporarily by [[disorientation]] (such as on roller coaster rides or when a person has been spinning in circles) or by some [[psychoactive drug|drug]]s ([[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[lidocaine]], and other [[central nervous system]] depressants, inhalant drugs, [[stimulant]]s, [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s, and [[dissociative]] drugs).

===Early-onset nystagmus===
Early-onset nystagmus occurs more frequently than acquired nystagmus. It can be insular or accompany other disorders (such as micro-ophthalmic anomalies or [[Down syndrome]]). Early-onset nystagmus itself is usually mild and non-progressive. The affected persons are usually unaware of their spontaneous eye movements, but vision can be impaired depending on the severity of the eye movements.

Types of early-onset nystagmus include the following, along with some of their causes:

*Infantile:
**[[Albinism]]
**[[Aniridia]]
**Bilateral [[congenital cataract]]
**Bilateral [[optic nerve hypoplasia]]
**[[Idiopathic]]
**[[Leber's congenital amaurosis]]
**[[Optic nerve]] or [[macula]]r disease
**[[Persistent tunica vasculosa lentis]]
**[[Rod monochromatism]]
**Visual-motor syndrome of functional monophthalmus
*Latent nystagmus
*[[Noonan syndrome]]
*Nystagmus blockage syndrome

X-linked infantile nystagmus is associated with mutations of the gene [[FRMD7]], which is located on the [[X chromosome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Self J, Lotery A | title = A review of the molecular genetics of congenital Idiopathic Nystagmus (CIN) | journal = Ophthalmic Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–91 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18161616 | doi = 10.1080/13816810701651233 | s2cid = 46052164 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18431453">{{cite journal | vauthors = Li N, Wang L, Cui L, Zhang L, Dai S, Li H, Chen X, Zhu L, Hejtmancik JF, Zhao K | title = Five novel mutations of the FRMD7 gene in Chinese families with X-linked infantile nystagmus | journal = Molecular Vision | volume = 14 | pages = 733–8 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18431453 | pmc = 2324116 }}</ref>

Infantile nystagmus is also associated with two X-linked eye diseases known as complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and incomplete CSNB (iCSNB or CSNB-2), which are caused by mutations of one of two genes located on the X chromosome. In CSNB, mutations are found in NYX ([[nyctalopin]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Poopalasundaram S, Erskine L, Cheetham ME, Hardcastle AJ | title = Focus on molecules: nyctalopin | journal = Experimental Eye Research | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 627–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16157331 | doi = 10.1016/j.exer.2005.07.017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroy BP, Budde BS, Wittmer M, De Baere E, Berger W, Zeitz C | title = A common NYX mutation in Flemish patients with X linked CSNB | journal = The British Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 692–6 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 18617546 | doi = 10.1136/bjo.2008.143727 | hdl = 1854/LU-940940 | s2cid = 22631306 | url = https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/940940 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> CSNB-2 involves mutations of CACNA1F, a [[voltage-gated calcium channel]] that, when mutated, does not conduct ions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peloquin JB, Rehak R, Doering CJ, McRory JE | title = Functional analysis of congenital stationary night blindness type-2 CACNA1F mutations F742C, G1007R, and R1049W | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 150 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–45 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17949918 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.09.021 | s2cid = 22643376 }}</ref>

===Acquired nystagmus===
Nystagmus that occurs later in childhood or in adulthood is called acquired nystagmus. The cause is often unknown, or [[idiopathic]], and thus referred to as idiopathic nystagmus. Other common causes include diseases and disorders of the central nervous system, [[metabolic disorder]]s and alcohol and drug toxicity. In the elderly, [[stroke]] is the most common cause.

====Central nervous system (CNS) diseases and disorders====
[[Central nervous system]] disorders such as with a [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] problem, the nystagmus can be in any direction ''including'' horizontal. Purely vertical nystagmus usually originates in the central nervous system, but it is also an adverse effect commonly seen in high [[phenytoin]] toxicity. Other causes of toxicity that may result in nystagmus include:

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Horizontal-nystagmus.gif|thumb|right|Fast-phase horizontal eye movement vision]]
[[File:Vertical-nystagmus.gif|thumb|right|Fast-phase vertical eye movement vision]]
Nystagmus is highly noticeable but rarely recognized. Nystagmus can be clinically investigated by using a number of [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] standard tests. The simplest one is the [[caloric reflex test]], in which one [[ear canal]] is irrigated with warm or cold water or air. The temperature gradient provokes the stimulation of the [[horizontal semicircular canal]] and the consequent nystagmus.
Nystagmus is often very commonly present with [[Chiari malformation]].

The resulting movement of the eyes may be recorded and quantified by a special device called an [[electronystagmograph]] (ENG), a form of [[electrooculography]] (an electrical method of measuring eye movements using external [[electrodes]]),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markley BA | title = Introduction to electronystagmography for END technologists | journal = American Journal of Electroneurodiagnostic Technology | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 178–89 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17982846 | doi = 10.1080/1086508X.2007.11079629 | s2cid = 40334544 }}</ref> or an even less invasive device called a [[Videonystagmography|videonystagmograph]] (VNG),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mosca F, Sicignano S, Leone CA | title = Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo: videonystagmographic study using rotatory test | journal = Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–72 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 14526552 |citeseerx=10.1.1.525.9140 }}</ref> a form of [[video-oculography]] (VOG) (a video-based method of measuring eye movements using external small cameras built into head masks), administered by an [[audiologist]]. Special swinging chairs with electrical controls can be used to induce rotatory nystagmus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eggert T | title = Eye movement recordings: methods | journal = Developments in Ophthalmology | volume = 40 | pages = 15–34 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17314477 | doi = 10.1159/000100347 | isbn = 978-3-8055-8251-3 }}</ref>

Over the past forty years, objective eye-movement-recording techniques have been applied to the study of nystagmus, and the results have led to greater accuracy of measurement and understanding of the condition.

[[Orthoptist]]s may also use an [[optokinetic drum]], or [[electrooculography]] or [[Frenzel goggles]] to assess a patient's eye movements.

Nystagmus can be caused by subsequent [[Foveal|foveation]] of moving objects, [[pathology]], sustained rotation or [[substance abuse|substance use]]. Nystagmus is not to be confused with other superficially similar-appearing disorders of eye movements ([[Saccade|saccadic]] oscillations) such as [[opsoclonus]] or [[ocular flutter]] that are composed purely of fast-phase (saccadic) eye movements, while nystagmus is characterized by the combination of a smooth pursuit, which usually acts to take the eye off the point of focus, interspersed with the saccadic movement that serves to bring the eye back on target. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish among these conditions.

In [[medicine]], the presence of nystagmus can be [[benign]], or it can indicate an underlying visual or [[neurology|neurological problem]].<ref name="pmid12438459">{{cite journal | vauthors = Serra A, Leigh RJ | title = Diagnostic value of nystagmus: spontaneous and induced ocular oscillations | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 615–8 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12438459 | pmc = 1757336 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.73.6.615 }}</ref>

===Pathologic nystagmus===
Pathological nystagmus is characterized by "excessive drifts of stationary retinal images that degrades vision and may produce illusory motion of the seen world: oscillopsia (an exception is congenital nystagmus)".<ref name="Differences Between Physiologic and Pathologic Nystagmus">{{cite web|url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EHSL-NOVEL/id/1855|title=Differences Between Physiologic and Pathologic Nystagmus|publisher=Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

When nystagmus occurs without fulfilling its normal function, it is pathologic (deviating from the healthy or normal condition). Pathological nystagmus is the result of damage to one or more components of the [[vestibular system]], including the [[semicircular canal]]s, [[otolith]] organs, and the [[cerebellum|vestibulocerebellum]].{{contradict-inline|date=April 2014}}

Pathological nystagmus generally causes a degree of [[vision impairment]], although the severity of such impairment varies widely. Also, many [[Blindness|blind]] people have nystagmus, which is one reason that some wear dark glasses.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Neurological Basis for Eye Movements of the Blind |date=2013 |journal=PLOS ONE |pmc=3575504 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e56556 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056556 |doi-access=free |pmid=23441203 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...856556S | vauthors = Schneider RM, Thurtell MJ, Eisele S, Lincoff N, Bala E, Leigh RJ }}</ref>

====Variations====
*'''Central nystagmus''' occurs as a result of either normal or abnormal processes not related to the vestibular organ. For example, lesions of the midbrain or cerebellum can result in up- and down-beat nystagmus.
**'''Gaze induced nystagmus''' occurs or is exacerbated as a result of changing one's gaze toward or away from a particular side which has an affected central apparatus.<ref name="Godl_GEN&Rebound">{{cite web|url=https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s6089dz6|title=Gaze-evoked and rebound nystagmus in a cerebellar syndrome| vauthors = Gold D |website=Neuro-Ophthalmology Virtual Education Library (NOVEL): Daniel Gold Collection|publisher=Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library|access-date=9 September 2019|ref=Gold_GEN&Rebound}}</ref>
*'''Peripheral nystagmus''' occurs as a result of either normal or diseased functional states of the vestibular system and may combine a rotational component with vertical or horizontal eye movements and may be ''spontaneous'', ''positional'', or ''evoked''.
**'''Positional nystagmus''' occurs when a person's head is in a specific position.<ref name="pmid16705203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Anagnostou E, Mandellos D, Limbitaki G, Papadimitriou A, Anastasopoulos D | title = Positional nystagmus and vertigo due to a solitary brachium conjunctivum plaque | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–2 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16705203 | pmc = 2077463 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2005.084624 }}</ref> An example of disease state in which this occurs is [[benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV).
**'''Post rotational nystagmus''' occurs after an imbalance is created between a normal side and a diseased side by stimulation of the vestibular system by rapid shaking or rotation of the head.
**'''Spontaneous nystagmus''' is nystagmus that occurs randomly, regardless of the position of the patient's head.

===Physiological nystagmus===
[[File:Lawrence 1960 13.8.png|thumb|right|A diagram of the [[caloric reflex test]], which tests the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR) by irrigating the ear canal with warm or cold water to induce physiological nystagmus.]]
Physiological nystagmus is a form of involuntary [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] that is part of the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR), characterized by alternating [[smooth pursuit]] in one direction and [[saccadic movement]] in the other direction.

====Variations====
The direction of nystagmus is defined by the direction of its quick phase (e.g. a '''right-beating nystagmus''' is characterized by a rightward-moving quick phase, and a '''left-beating nystagmus''' by a leftward-moving quick phase). The [[oscillations]] may occur in the vertical,<ref name="pmid15872015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pierrot-Deseilligny C, Milea D | title = Vertical nystagmus: clinical facts and hypotheses | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1237–1246 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15872015 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh532 | doi-access = free }}</ref> horizontal or [[torsional]] planes, or in any combination. The resulting nystagmus is often named as a gross description of the movement, e.g. '''downbeat nystagmus''', '''upbeat nystagmus''', '''seesaw nystagmus''', '''periodic alternating nystagmus'''.

These descriptive names can be misleading, however, as many were assigned historically, solely on the basis of subjective clinical examination, which is not sufficient to determine the eyes' true trajectory.
* '''Optokinetic''' (''syn. ''opticokinetic) '''nystagmus''': a nystagmus induced by looking at moving visual stimuli, such as moving horizontal or vertical lines, and/or stripes. For example, if one fixates on a stripe of a rotating drum with alternating black and white, the gaze retreats to fixate on a new stripe as the drum moves. This is first a rotation with the same angular velocity, then returns in a [[saccade]] in the opposite direction. The process proceeds indefinitely. This is optokinetic nystagmus, and is a source for understanding the [[fixation reflex]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Testing for Optokinetic Nystigmus |url={{Google books|pEQhV88LTJYC|page=109|plainurl=y}} |pages=109–111 }} in {{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-1-4377-1397-8.00008-3 |chapter=Examining the Visual System |title=Pediatric Clinical Skills |year=2011 | vauthors = Laroche GR |pages=101–121 |isbn=978-1-4377-1397-8 | veditors = Goldbloom RB }}</ref>
* '''Postrotatory nystagmus''': if one spins in a chair continuously and stops suddenly, the fast phase of nystagmus is in the opposite direction of rotation, known as the "post-rotatory nystagmus", while slow phase is in the direction of rotation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simón V, Llopis M, Bartual J | title = Physiological Postrotatory Nystagmus | journal = Applied Neurophysiology | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–171 | date = 1975 | pmid = 1232915 | doi = 10.1159/000102658 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Congenital nystagmus has long been viewed as untreatable, but medications have been discovered that show promise in some patients. In 1980, researchers discovered that a drug called [[baclofen]] could stop periodic alternating nystagmus. Subsequently, [[gabapentin]], an anticonvulsant, led to improvement in about half the patients who took it.

[[Acupuncture]] tests have produced conflicting evidence on its beneficial effects on the symptoms of nystagmus.

Physical or occupational therapy is also used to treat nystagmus.

==Epidemiology==
Nystagmus is a relatively common clinical condition, affecting one in several thousand people. A survey conducted in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, found that by the age of two, one in every 670 children had manifested nystagmus.<ref name=ANN/> Authors of another study in the United Kingdom estimated an incidence of 24 in 10,000 (c. 0.240%), noting an apparently higher rate amongst white Europeans than in individuals of Asian origin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarvananthan N, Surendran M, Roberts EO, Jain S, Thomas S, Shah N, Proudlock FA, Thompson JR, McLean RJ, Degg C, Woodruff G, Gottlob I | title = The prevalence of nystagmus: the Leicestershire nystagmus survey | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science | volume = 50 | issue = 11 | pages = 5201–6 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19458336 | doi = 10.1167/iovs.09-3486 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

{{See also|Positional alcohol nystagmus}}

In the United States, testing for ''horizontal gaze nystagmus'' is one of a battery of [[Drunk driving (United States)#Field sobriety tests|field sobriety tests]] used by [[police]] officers to determine whether a suspect is [[driving under the influence]] of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. Horizontal gaze nystagmus will show if a subject is under the influence of a central nervous system depressant, an inhalant, or a dissociative anesthetic. The test involves observation of the suspect's [[pupil]] as it follows a moving object, noting
# lack of smooth pursuit,
# distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and
# the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.

The horizontal gaze nystagmus test has been highly criticized and major errors in the testing methodology and analysis found.<ref name="pmid15270451">{{cite journal | vauthors = Booker JL | title = The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test: fraudulent science in the American courts | journal = Science & Justice | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 133–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15270451 | doi = 10.1016/S1355-0306(04)71705-0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11393940">{{cite journal | vauthors = Booker JL | title = End-position nystagmus as an indicator of ethanol intoxication | journal = Science & Justice | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–6 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11393940 | doi = 10.1016/S1355-0306(01)71862-X }}</ref> However, the validity of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test for use as a field sobriety test for persons with a [[Blood alcohol content|blood alcohol level]] between 0.04 and 0.08{{clarify|date=January 2022}} is supported by peer-reviewed studies and has been found to be a more accurate indication of blood alcohol content than other standard field sobriety tests.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McKnight AJ, Langston EA, McKnight AS, Lange JE | title = Sobriety tests for low blood alcohol concentrations | journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–11 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11939359 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-4575(01)00027-6 }}</ref>
