'''Baker's Chocolate''' is a [[brand]] name for the line of [[baking chocolate]]s<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45">{{cite book | last1=Goldstein | first1=D. | last2=Mintz | first2=S. | last3=Krondl | first3=M. | last4=Rath | first4=E. | last5=Mason | first5=L. | last6=Quinzio | first6=G. | last7=Heinzelmann | first7=U. | title=The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-19-931361-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1bCBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45 | page=45}}</ref> owned by [[Kraft Heinz]]. Products include a variety of bulk [[chocolate]]s, including [[types of chocolate|white and unsweetened]], and sweetened [[coconut]] flakes. It is one of the largest national brands of chocolate in the United States. The company was originally named [[Walter Baker & Company]].

==History==
In 1764, John Hannon (or alternatively spelled "Hannan" in some sources) and the American physician Dr. James Baker started importing beans and producing chocolate in the [[Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District|Lower Mills]] section of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]].<ref>Cf. Committee of the Dorchester Antiquarian and Historical Society, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sT0OAAAAIAAJ "History of the Town of Dorchester, Massachusetts"], Boston : E. Clapp, Jr., 1859. Cf. p.627. The spelling here is John ''Hannan'', but in later sources, ''Hannon'' is used.</ref>

After Hannon never returned from a 1779 sailing trip to the West Indies to purchase cocoa beans, his wife sold the company to Baker in 1780, and the company was renamed to the [[Walter Baker & Company|Baker Chocolate Company]].<ref name="Sammarco 2011 p. 9">{{cite book | last=Sammarco | first=A.M. | title=The Baker Chocolate Company: A Sweet History | publisher=History Press | year=2011 | isbn=978-1-61423-113-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJ4qLLeaQ5UC&pg=PA10 | pages=9–11}}</ref>  His first product was a cake of [[chocolate]] for making a sweetened chocolate drink. Distribution was mainly in the [[Northeastern United States]] until 1804, when James Baker's son, Edmund Baker, inherited the family business and increased production with a state-of-the-art mill.

The original brand name was "Hannon’s Best Chocolate", which was "manufactured for almost fifteen years" and was sold with a money-back guarantee if the consumer was unsatisfied with the product.<ref name="Sammarco 2011 p. 9"/> The name was changed in 1780 after Hannon's wife, Elizabeth Gore Hannon, sold the company to Baker in 1780, after Hannon never returned from a 1779 sailing trip to the West Indies to purchase cocoa beans.<ref name="Sammarco 2011 p. 9"/> At the time, it was rumored that Hannon intended to leave his wife, and thus deserted her.<ref name="Sammarco 2011 p. 9"/>  Original versions of the brand were not prepared for baking, and before 1865, the company purveyed three grades of [[drinking chocolate]], which were "Best Chocolate", "Common Chocolate" and "Inferior Chocolate".<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/> The inferior grade was mostly sold to West Indian and American slaves.<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/>

By 1849, under Walter Baker, the Baker's Chocolate brand had spread to [[California]], during the [[Gold Rush]] era. Production was limited to one kind of chocolate until 1852, when employee Samuel German created "German's Sweet Chocolate" that had a higher sugar content than previous baking chocolates.  In 1957 a Dallas, Texas newspaper printed a cake recipe for "German's Chocolate Cake" based on this chocolate, which was reprinted by the company's owner [[General Foods]] under the "[[German chocolate cake]]", becoming the accepted name.

Production steadily increased through the century. The trademark logo of [[La Belle Chocolatière]] was adopted in 1883 by the fourth-generation familial owner, [[Henry L. Pierce]], step-nephew of Walter Baker. Pierce began advertising Baker's Chocolate heavily in newspapers to increase sales.<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/> In 1896, Baker's Chocolate was advertising in around 8,000 newspapers in the United States.<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/> The company also advertised using signage and cards in grocery stores, in novels, in street cars and using billboards.<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/> Promotional offers of tableware and logo pins helped attract customers. Around the late 1800s, the company began promoting the notion of using chocolate as an ingredient in desserts and for baking.<ref name="Goldstein Mintz Krondl Rath 2015 p. 45"/>

Following Pierce's death in 1896, the Forbes Syndicate bought the company, which they sold  In 1927 to the [[Post Consumer Brands|Postum Cereal Company]], later known as [[General Foods]].  In 1966 production moved from Dorchester, Massachusetts to [[Dover, Delaware]].  The company was passed onto [[Kraft Foods]] in 1989 when they acquired General Foods. Baker's is now owned by Kraft Heinz, a company formed by the merger between Kraft Foods and [[Heinz]].

==Products==
Baker's continues to expand its line of products, focusing on conveniences for the home baker. Some products, such as [[vanilla extract]] and [[cocoa powder]], have been discontinued with company turnovers.
