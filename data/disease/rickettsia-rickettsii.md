'''''Rickettsia rickettsii''''' is a [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]], intracellular, [[coccobacillus]] bacterium that was first discovered in 1902.<ref name="Patel-2023" /> Having a reduced genome, the bacterium harvests nutrients from its host cell to carry out respiration, making it an organoheterotroph. Maintenance of its genome is carried out through vertical gene transfer where specialization of the bacterium allows it to shuttle host sugars directly into its TCA cycle.<ref name=":3" /> 

Other characteristics of the bacteria include membrane proteins that are useful in the identification of ''R. rickettsii'' strains and useful in the targeting of antibiotics. A capsule encircling the bacterium allows for attachment to host cells and additionally acts as a defense mechanism for resisting phagocytosis. Varying strains of ''R. rickettsii'' have different genotypes and phenotypes that alter the pathogenicity, virulence, and appearance of the bacteria.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="Clark_2015" /><ref name=":5">{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark TR, Ellison DW, Kleba B, Hackstadt T |date=April 2011 |title=Complementation of Rickettsia rickettsii RelA/SpoT restores a nonlytic plaque phenotype |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=1631–1637 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00048-11 |pmc=3067566 |pmid=21300770 |veditors=Morrison RP}}</ref>

''R. rickettsii'' is the causative agent of [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever|Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever]] and is transferred to its host via a tick bite. It is one of the most pathogenic ''[[Rickettsia]]'' species<ref name="Hackstadt">{{cite web | vauthors = Hackstadt T |title=Biology of Rickettsia |url=https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/ZIA-AI000977-13 |language=en}}</ref> and affects a large majority of the Western Hemisphere, most commonly the Americas.<ref name="Vail 2014 252–265">{{cite book | vauthors = Conover MR, Vail RM | chapter = Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Other Spotted Fevers |date=2014 | chapter-url = https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.1201/b17428-18/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever-spotted-fevers-michael-conover-rosanna-vail | title = Human Diseases from Wildlife |pages=252–265 |access-date=2023-10-31 |publisher=CRC Press |doi=10.1201/b17428-18 |isbn=978-0-429-10009-3}}</ref> The pathogenic agent has been found on every continent, except Antarctica; however, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever occurs mostly in North, Central, and South America.<ref name="Vail 2014 252–265" /> This prevalence is due to ''R. rickettsi'' thriving in warm, damp environments.<ref name="Parola2005" /> These environments provide sufficient conditions for the amplification of the bacteria within a vertebrate host, such as a horse or dog. The bacteria are transmitted through the vector, a tick, to a vertebrate host where it can then be amplified and passed on to a person, resulting in the zoonotic disease.<ref name=":0" />

Headache, high fever, and spotted rash are some effects of the disease with more severe cases resulting in organ damage and coma.<ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics_2018" /><ref name="CDC_2019" /><ref name=":2" /> Antibiotics, such as doxycycline, target the ribosome of ''R. rickettsii'' in order to inhibit protein synthesis of the bacteria, providing a form of treatment for the disease.<ref name=":6" />

==Transmission cycle==
The most common hosts for ''R. rickettsii'' are ticks.<ref name=Parola2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parola P, Paddock CD, Raoult D | title = Tick-borne rickettsioses around the world: emerging diseases challenging old concepts | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 719–756 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16223955 | pmc = 1265907 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.18.4.719-756.2005 }}</ref> Ticks that carry ''R. rickettsii'' fall into the family of ''[[Ixodidae]]'' ticks, also known as "hard-bodied" ticks.<ref name="Parola_2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parola P, Davoust B, Raoult D |date=2005-06-01 |title=Tick- and flea-borne rickettsial emerging zoonoses |journal=Veterinary Research |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=469–492 |doi=10.1051/vetres:2005004 |pmid=15845235 |doi-access=free|pmc=7996843 }}</ref> Ticks are vectors, reservoirs, and amplifiers of this bacteria.<ref name=Parola2005/>

There are currently three known tick species that commonly carry ''R. rickettsii''. The [[American dog tick|American Dog Tick]] (''Dermacentor variabilis''), mainly found in the eastern United States, is the most common vector for ''R''. ''rickettsii''. The [[Rocky Mountain Wood Tick]] (''Dermacentor andersoni''), found in the Rocky Mountain States, and the [[Brown dog tick|Brown Dog Tick]] (''Rhipicephalus sanguine)'', found in select areas of the southern United States, are also known vectors of the pathogen.<ref name="Parola_2005" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jay R, Armstrong PA | title = Clinical characteristics of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the United States: A literature review | language = English | journal = Journal of Vector Borne Diseases | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 114–120 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 34290155 | doi = 10.4103/0972-9062.310863 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Ticks can contract ''R. rickettsii'' by many means. First, an uninfected tick can become infected when feeding on the blood of an infected vertebrate host; such as a rabbit, during the larval or nymph stages, this mode of transmission is called ''[[transstadial transmission]]''.<ref name="pmid36797442">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravindran R, Hembram PK, Kumar GS, Kumar KG, Deepa CK, Varghese A | title = Transovarial transmission of pathogenic protozoa and rickettsial organisms in ticks | journal = Parasitology Research | volume = 122 | issue = 3 | pages = 691–704 | date = March 2023 | pmid = 36797442 | pmc = 9936132 | doi = 10.1007/s00436-023-07792-9 }}</ref> Once a tick becomes infected with this pathogen, they are infected for life.

However, this process is unlikely to play a major role in the maintenance of ''R. rickettsii'' within a population as females infected during mating have not been observed to produce infected offspring. Infected female ticks can transmit the infection to their offspring, in a process known as ''[[Transovarial transmission|transovarian passage]]''.<ref name=tor19>{{cite book| vauthors = Tortora GJ, Funke BR, Case CL |title=Microbiology: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-321-73360-3|pages=661–662}}</ref> Notably, ''R. rickettsii'' is inefficient at infecting the ovaries of adult female ticks, resulting in a lowered rate of vertical transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgdorfer W, Brinton LP | title = Mechanisms of transovarial infection of spotted fever Rickettsiae in ticks | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–72 | date = November 1975 | pmid = 829476 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb35088.x | bibcode = 1975NYASA.266...61B }}</ref> Rickettsial colonization of the ovaries sees higher success when ticks obtain the pathogen as a larva or nymph.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Piranda EM, Faccini JL, Pinter A, Pacheco RC, Cançado PH, Labruna MB | title = Experimental infection of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks with the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, using experimentally infected dogs | journal = Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–36 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20569011 | doi = 10.1089/vbz.2009.0250 }}</ref> Reduced fecundity is also observed in ticks infected with ''R. rickettsii''.<ref name="Laukaitis-2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laukaitis HJ, Macaluso KR | title = Unpacking the intricacies of Rickettsia-vector interactions | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 734–746 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34162522 | pmc = 8344978 | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2021.05.008 }}</ref> As a result of these limitations, long-term maintenance of ''R. rickettsii'' in populations of ticks relies mainly on horizontal transmission through the exchange of bacteria during feedings of infected hosts.<ref name="Laukaitis-2021" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin ML, Zemtsova GE, Killmaster LF, Snellgrove A, Schumacher LB | title = Vector competence of Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae) for Rickettsia rickettsii | journal = Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 615–622 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28433728 | pmc = 5657001 | doi = 10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.04.006 }}</ref>

=== Ecology ===
In addition to having vectors in the United States, ''R. rickettsii'' commonly infect certain ticks in South America. The cayenne tick (''Amblyomma cajennense)'' and the brown dog tick (''Rhipicephalus sanguineus)'' are both common vectors found in South America. The yellow dog tick (''Amblyomma aureolatum'') is another vector that infects specific parts of Brazil. Infecting horses and capybaras, the cayenne tick turns vertebrate hosts into amplifier hosts of the bacteria. Other small rodent species serve as amplifier hosts in the United States and South America.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Labruna |first=Marcelo B. |date=May 2009 |title=Ecology of Rickettsia in South America |url=https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04516.x |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=1166 |issue=1 |pages=156–166 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04516.x |pmid=19538276 |bibcode=2009NYASA1166..156L |issn=0077-8923}}</ref>

Specific requirements must be fulfilled when looking at vertebrate hosts to become amplifiers for ''R. rickettsii.'' First, there should be a large population of said host in the endemic area. Then, the vertebrate must be a primary host for the vector, so it can carry out its life cycle. Furthermore, it must be prone to infection from ''R. rickettsii'', and once inside, the bacteria must infect the host to a great enough degree that its blood will infect other vectors that attach to the host. Finally, the host should be part of a prolific species, so that the species has a continuous supply of nonimmune amplifiers.<ref name=":0" />

===Transmission in mammals===
Due to its confinement in the midgut and small intestine, ''Rickettsia rickettsii'' can be transmitted to mammals, including humans.

Transmission can occur in multiple ways. One way to contract the infection is through contact with an infected host's feces. If an infected host's feces come into contact with an open skin barrier, it is possible for the disease to be transmitted. An uninfected host can become infected when eating food that contains the feces of the infected vector.<ref name="pmid35993770">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim HK |title=Rickettsia-Host-Tick Interactions: Knowledge Advances and Gaps |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=90 |issue=9 |pages=e0062121 |date=September 2022 |pmid=35993770 |pmc=9476906 |doi=10.1128/iai.00621-21 |url=}}</ref> Another way of contraction is by the bite of an infected tick. After getting bitten by an infected tick, ''R. rickettsiae'' are transmitted to the bloodstream by tick salivary secretions.<ref name="pmid35993770" />

Having multiple modes of transmission ensures the persistence of ''R. rickettsii'' in a population. Additionally, having multiple modes of transmission helps the disease adapt better to new environments and prevents it from becoming eradicated. ''R. rickettsii'' has evolved a number of strategic mechanisms, or [[virulence]] factors, that allow it to invade the host immune system and successfully infect its host.<ref name="mw">{{cite journal |vauthors=Helminiak L, Mishra S, Kim HK |date=December 2022 |title=Pathogenicity and virulence of Rickettsia |url= |journal=Virulence |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1752–1771 |doi=10.1080/21505594.2022.2132047 |pmc=9553169 |pmid=36208040}}</ref>

== Physiology ==

=== Metabolic Pathways ===
''R. rickettsii'' are obligate intracellular bacteria, meaning they need a host cell in order to replicate and survive. This is due to the pathogen having many metabolic deficiencies and having to borrow metabolites from the host cell. ''R. rickettsii'' is unable to utilize [[glycolysis]] and the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] due to a reduced genome, and since these pathways are unusable, the bacterium must use the [[Citric acid cycle|tricarboxylic acid cycle]] (TCA) as an alternative pathway. However, this can only be done through the use of the host cell's metabolites. This is possible because cell envelope glycoconjugates are synthesized using three particular sugars found in host cells, along with the other metabolites that are acquired from the host cell that will fuel the TCA Cycle.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |vauthors=Driscoll TP, Verhoeve VI, Guillotte ML, Lehman SS, Rennoll SA, Beier-Sexton M, Rahman MS, Azad AF, Gillespie JJ |date=September 2017 |title=Wholly ''Rickettsia''! Reconstructed Metabolic Profile of the Quintessential Bacterial Parasite of Eukaryotic Cells |journal=mBio |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=e00859–17 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00859-17 |pmc=5615194 |pmid=28951473}}</ref> 

One of the metabolites that ''R. rickettsii'' uses from its host cell in order to synthesize [[peptidoglycan]] and [[lipopolysaccharide]]s is a sugar called UDP-''N''-acetyl-α-d-glucosamine. Other metabolites that are needed for this cell to survive within the host cell are imported [[glutamine]], [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], and [[Malic acid|malate]]. These are used to regulate the flow of [[acetyl-CoA]], which is synthesized from [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that the bacteria also takes from the host cell. Overall, ''R. rickettsii'' has a genome that does not encode many of the enzymes and proteins that are required for several pathways besides the TCA cycle. These bacteria import many of the intermediates, cofactors, and byproducts from the host cells' metabolic pathways to use for their own benefit and synthesis of necessary structures and energy for survival.<ref name=":3" />

=== Morphology ===
''R. rickettsii''  has many vital proteins within its cellular membranes. One of these proteins is YbgF, which maintains the structure of the cellular membrane. YbgF is found within both the inner and outer membranes along with another protein called TolC. TolC is a [[transport protein]] that connects to other transport proteins within the [[periplasmic space]] and inner membrane. These two proteins are believed to be associated with pathogenicity of this microbe and serve as specific points that [[Antibody|antibodies]] can bind to in order to prevent the bacteria from interacting with host cells.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last1=Gong |first1=Wenping |last2=Qi |first2=Yong |last3=Xiong |first3=Xiaolu |last4=Jiao |first4=Jun |last5=Duan |first5=Changsong |last6=Wen |first6=Bohai |date=2015-03-04 |title=Rickettsia rickettsii outer membrane protein YbgF induces protective immunity in C3H/HeN mice |journal=Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics |language=en |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=642–649 |doi=10.1080/21645515.2015.1011572 |issn=2164-5515 |pmc=4514262 |pmid=25714655}}</ref>

''R. rickettsii'' also has an outer layer or a "microcapsule", which acts similarly to the S-layer or [[slime layer]] of other bacteria.  This slime layer consists mostly of [[polysaccharide]]s, and the "microcapsule" contributes to mechanisms involving anti-[[phagocytosis]] and attachment to host cells.<ref name="pmid83297">{{cite journal |vauthors=Silverman DJ, Wisseman CL, Waddell AD, Jones M |title=External layers of Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia rickettsii: occurrence of a slime layer |journal=Infect Immun |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=233–46 |date=October 1978 |pmid=83297 |pmc=422141 |doi=10.1128/iai.22.1.233-246.1978 |url=}}</ref>

=== Pathophysiology ===
While humans are hosts for ''R. rickettsii'', they do not contribute to rickettsial transmission. Rather, the pathogen is maintained through its vector: ticks.<ref name="mw" /> ''R. rickettsii'' invades the [[endothelial cells]] that line the blood vessels in the host's body. Increased permeability of vessels, microvascular hemorrhages, and necrosis can result from damage to the cells.<ref name=":2" /> The pathogen causes changes in the host cell [[cytoskeleton]] that induces [[phagocytosis]], and ''R. rickettsii'' replicates further and infects other cells in the host's body.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sahni A, Fang R, Sahni SK, Walker DH |date=January 2019 |title=Pathogenesis of Rickettsial Diseases: Pathogenic and Immune Mechanisms of an Endotheliotropic Infection |journal=Annual Review of Pathology |volume=14 |pages=127–152 |doi=10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012418-012800 |pmc=6505701 |pmid=30148688}}</ref> ''R. rickettsii's'' survival in immune system cells increases the pathogen's [[virulence]] in mammalian hosts.

[[Actin-based motility|Actin-Based Motility (ABM)]] is a virulence factor that allows for the pathogen to evade the host's immune cells and spread to neighboring cells. It is suggested that the Sca2 gene, which is an actin-polymerizing determinant, is a distinguishing factor for the ''Rickettsia'' family, as ''R. rickettsii'' mutants with a Sca2 [[Transposable element|transposon]] the bacteria can avoid autophagic processes by host phagocytic cells. This leads to an increase in disease manifestation for the host.<ref name="mw" />

''R.'' ''rickettsii'' is also able to suppress immune responses while dwelling in infected cells by creating inhibitory proteins such as Rickettsial ankyrin repeat protein 2 (RARP2). RARP2 mediates the fragmentation of TGN, or the [[trans-Golgi network]], causing attenuation of vesicular transport and glycosylation defects in infected host cells. There are two important proteins within the host cell that are affected by these [[glycosylation]] defects: TGN46 and major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-I). [[MHC class I|MHC-I]] is an important protein for defending against pathogens as it functions as a antigen presenting complex signaling it's infection status to lyphocytes. However, since RARP2 causes attenuation of vesicular transport, MHC-I is unable to be transported to the plasma membrane and the infected cell will not be able to alert host immune cells. Thus, the bacterial cells are able to avoid certain immune responses and allow for proliferation within a host cell.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kellermann M, Scharte F, Hensel M |date=June 2021 |title=Manipulation of Host Cell Organelles by Intracellular Pathogens |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=6484 |doi=10.3390/ijms22126484 |pmc=8235465 |pmid=34204285 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Genome and phenotypes ==
''R. rickettsii'' is an obligate intracellular alpha proteobacterium that belongs to the ''Rickettsiacea'' family.<ref name="Hackstadt"/> It has a genome that consists of about 1.27 Mbp with ~1,350 predicted genes,<ref name="Clark_2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark TR, Noriea NF, Bublitz DC, Ellison DW, Martens C, Lutter EI, Hackstadt T | title = Comparative genome sequencing of Rickettsia rickettsii strains that differ in virulence | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 1568–1576 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25644009 | pmc = 4363411 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.03140-14 | veditors = Morrison RP }}</ref> which is smaller compared to most other bacteria.

=== Genomic comparison of strains ===
''R. rickettsii'' has a relatively small genome; however, variances in gene expression between different strains can lead to various functions of the bacteria. For instance, there are two major strains of ''R. rickettsii'' called the Iowa and the Sheila Smith strains. The Sheila Smith strain is a virulent strain, while the Iowa strain is an avirulent strain. Microarrays revealed that there were only four distinct differences in the gene expression of ''R. rickettsii''; however, these four changes lead to complete differences in virulence, and thus the niche of the bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Damon W. |last2=Clark |first2=Tina R. |last3=Sturdevant |first3=Daniel E. |last4=Virtaneva |first4=Kimmo |last5=Porcella |first5=Stephen F. |last6=Hackstadt |first6=Ted |date=February 2008 |title=Genomic comparison of virulent Rickettsia rickettsii Sheila Smith and avirulent Rickettsia rickettsii Iowa |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18025092/ |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=542–550 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00952-07 |issn=1098-5522 |pmc=2223442 |pmid=18025092}}</ref> A key feature allowing for differentiation is the rickettsial outer membrane protein, rOmpA and rOmpB <ref name="Clark_2015" /> which contributes to the identification of ''R. rickettsii'' strains as virulent.

===Signs and symptoms===
During the initial stages of the disease, the infected person may experience headaches, muscle aches, chills, and high fever. Other early symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and conjunctival injection (red eyes). Most people infected by ''R. rickettsii'' develop a spotted rash, that begins to appear 2 to 4 days after the individual develops a fever. If left untreated, more severe symptoms may develop; these symptoms may include insomnia, compromised mental ability, coma, and damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, or additional organs.<ref name="CDC_2019">{{Cite web |last=CDC |date=2019-05-07 |title=Rocky Mountain spotted fever home |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/index.html |access-date=2023-10-21 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us}}</ref><ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics_2018" />

The rash can differ greatly in appearance along the progress of the ''R. rickettsii'' infection.<ref name="CDC_2019" /> It is not itchy and starts out as flat pink macules located on the affected individual's hands, feet, arms, and legs.<ref name="Palatucci" /> During the course of the disease, the rash may form petechiae and take on a more darkened reddish purple spotted appearance, signifying severe disease.<ref>{{Cite web |last=CDC |date=2019-02-19 |title=Signs and symptoms of RMSF for healthcare providers |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/healthcare-providers/signs-symptoms.html |access-date=2023-11-03 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us}}</ref>

In rarer cases, patients may present with chest pain due to [[myocarditis]]. Additionally, rare symptoms include vision impairment and arthritis that may exist as chronic [[sequela]]e, lasting anywhere from 10 days to 4 years. Other chronic sequelae include some cases of neurological challenges, such as impaired speech, [[dysphagia]], [[ataxia]], memory loss, [[cortical blindness]], and decreased attention span. Necrosis of skin is another rare case of sequelae.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jay R, Armstrong PA | title = Clinical characteristics of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the United States: A literature review | journal = Journal of Vector Borne Diseases | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 114–120 | date = 2020 | pmid = 34290155 | doi = 10.4103/0972-9062.310863 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doyle A, Bhalla KS, Jones JM, Ennis DM | title = Myocardial involvement in rocky mountain spotted fever: a case report and review | journal = The American Journal of the Medical Sciences | volume = 332 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–210 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17031247 | doi = 10.1097/00000441-200610000-00009 }}</ref>

===Severe infections===
Patients with severe infections may require hospitalization. The more severe symptoms occur later in response to thrombosis (blood clotting) caused by ''R. rickettsii'' targeting endothelial cells in vascular tissue.<ref name="American Academy of Pediatrics_2018" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kristof MN, Allen PE, Yutzy LD, Thibodaux B, Paddock CD, Martinez JJ | title = Significant Growth by ''Rickettsia'' Species within Human Macrophage-Like Cells Is a Phenotype Correlated with the Ability to Cause Disease in Mammals | journal = Pathogens | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 228 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33669499 | doi = 10.3390/pathogens10020228 | pmc = 7934685 | doi-access = free }}</ref> They may become [[hyponatremic]], experience elevated liver enzymes, and other more pronounced symptoms.  It is not uncommon for severe cases to involve respiratory system, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, or renal system complications. In the case of [[meningoencephalitis]], ''R. rickettsii'' causes cellular damage to brain tissue, resulting in inflammation. Additionally, acute respiratory distress syndrome and [[Coagulopathy]] occur in cases that advance to severe stages of RMSF.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web | vauthors = Drexler N |date=2020 |title=Persistent Sequelae of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: Clinical Evidence, Cost, and Public Health Implications for Arizona Tribal Communities |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2410817332 |access-date=February 29, 2024 |website=ProQuest|id={{ProQuest|2410817332}} }}</ref> This disease is worst for elderly patients, males, African Americans, alcoholics, and patients with [[G6PD deficiency]].

=== Treatment ===
RMSF symptoms can vary from moderate to severe cases, and a delay in treatment is often associated with a higher case-fatality rate.<ref name="Botelho-Nevers-2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Botelho-Nevers E, Raoult D | title = Host, pathogen and treatment-related prognostic factors in rickettsioses | journal = European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 1139–1150 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21519943 | doi = 10.1007/s10096-011-1208-z }}</ref> The most common and effective treatment for Rocky mountain spotted fever is the anti-microbial agent [[doxycycline]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Breitschwerdt EB, Papich MG, Hegarty BC, Gilger B, Hancock SI, Davidson MG | title = Efficacy of doxycycline, azithromycin, or trovafloxacin for treatment of experimental Rocky Mountain spotted fever in dogs | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 813–821 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10103185 | pmc = 89211 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.43.4.813 }}</ref> This antibiotic acts as a [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] drug by inhibiting protein synthesis via blockage of the 30S ribosomal subunit.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Holmes NE, Charles PG |date=January 2009 |title=Safety and Efficacy Review of Doxycycline |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/CMT.S2035 |journal=Clinical Medicine.

Other treatments with [[chloramphenicol]], [[Quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolones]], and [[macrolide]]s have been explored. However, treatment with only chloramphenicol compared to other treatments (tetracycline-class drugs only, both chloramphenicol and tetracycline-class drugs, and neither drug) was associated with a case-fatality rate three times higher.<ref name="Botelho-Nevers-2011" /> Chloramphenicol, like doxycycline, also functions as a bacteriostatic drug, but it binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit in order to prevent protein synthesis. Macrolides target the 50S subunit as well; however, they block the exit site for peptides, while chloramphenicol blocks the aminoacyl-tRNA attachment site for transfer RNA.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Oong |first1=Ginny C. |title=Chloramphenicol |date=2024 |work=StatPearls |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555966/ |access-date=2024-04-10 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=32310426 |last2=Tadi |first2=Prasanna}}</ref>

==History==

[[Rocky Mountain spotted fever|Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever]] (RMSF) first emerged in the Idaho Valley in 1896 after being recognized by Major Marshall H. Wood.<ref name="Patel-2023">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Patel S, Pedroza LV | veditors = Bronze MS |date=2023-06-13 |title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF): Background, Etiology and Pathophysiology, Epidemiology |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/228042-overview?form=fpf |website=Medcape}}</ref> At the time of discovery, not much information was known about the disease. It was originally called "Black Measles" due to the infected area turning black during the late stages of the disease.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-07-08 |title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=www.niaid.nih.gov |language=en}}</ref> The first clinical description of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever was reported in Snake River Valley in 1899 by Edward E. Maxey.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao Y, Beare PA, Best SM, Morens DM, Bloom ME, Taubenberger JK | title = Genetic sequencing of a 1944 Rocky Mountain spotted fever vaccine | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 4687 | date = March 2023 | pmid = 36949107 | pmc = 10031714 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-023-31894-0 | bibcode = 2023NatSR..13.4687X }}</ref> At the time, 69% of individuals diagnosed with RMSF died.<ref name="Patel-2023" />

[[Howard Ricketts]] (1871–1910), an associate professor of pathology at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1902, was the first to identify and study ''R. rickettsii''.<ref name="Patel-2023" /> His research entailed interviewing victims of the disease as well as collecting infected animals to study. He was known to inject himself with [[pathogens]] to measure their effects. His research provided more information on the organism's [[Disease vector|vector]] and route of transmission.<ref name="Patel-2023" />

[[Simeon Burt Wolbach]] is credited for the first detailed description of the pathogenic agent that causes ''R. rickettsii'' in 1919. He described RMSF using the process of [[Giemsa stain]].<ref name="Patel-2023" /> He recognized the pathogenic agent as an intracellular bacterium that was seen most frequently in [[endothelial cells]].<ref name="Vail 2014 252–265"/>

The once lethal infection has become curable due to the research done in recent years. [[Chloramphenicol]] and tetracycline-class drugs, like [[doxycycline]], were first harnessed as treatment for RMSF in the late 1940s, but before their discovery, 1 in 5 infected patients died.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holman RC, Paddock CD, Curns AT, Krebs JW, McQuiston JH, Childs JE | title = Analysis of risk factors for fatal Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: evidence for superiority of tetracyclines for therapy | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 184 | issue = 11 | pages = 1437–1444 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11709786 | doi = 10.1086/324372 | url = https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/zoonoticspub/80 }}</ref> Treatment recommendations changed in the 1990s to support primary therapeutic use of tetracycline-class drugs. This coincided with a decrease in annual case-fatality rates (CFRs) from the 1980s on to the early 1990s.<ref name="CDC-2022" /> The fatality rate has dropped to between 5 and 10% since then.<ref name="CDC-2022">{{Cite web |last=CDC |date=2022-08-15 |title=Epidemiology and statistics of spotted fever rickettsioses |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us}}</ref>
