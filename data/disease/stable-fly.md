'''''Stomoxys calcitrans''''' is commonly called the '''stable fly''', '''barn fly''', '''biting house fly''', '''dog fly''', or '''power mower fly'''.<ref>{{cite thesis|hdl=2097/1072 | last= Talley|first= Justin L.| title= Management and Characterization of Stable Fly Larval Habitats at Round Bale Feeding Sites in Pastures| url= http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/1072/1/JustinTalley2008.pdf| publisher= Kansas State University| page=2|year= 2008| access-date=2009-04-06}}, citing {{cite book|last1=Hall|first1= R.D. |first2= J.P. |last2=Smith|year= 1986|chapter=Life history and economic importance of the stable fly|title=Stable fly biology and control in cattle feedlots|publisher= Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station |id=Publication 86–362–D}}</ref> Unlike most members of the family [[Muscidae]], ''Stomoxys calcitrans'' ('sharp mouth' + 'kicking') and others of its genus [[Hematophagy|suck blood]] from mammals.

==Physical features==
The stable fly resembles the common housefly (''[[Musca domestica]]''), though smaller, and on closer examination has a slightly wider and spotted abdomen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entomology.cornell.edu/cals/entomology/extension/vet/aid/cow/stablefly.cfm |title=Veterinary Entomology &#124; Veterinary Entomology |publisher=Entomology.cornell.edu |date= |access-date=2013-11-27}}</ref> Adults are generally about {{Convert|6|-|8|mm|frac=16|abbr=in}} in length and a lighter color than the housefly. Unlike the housefly, where the mouth part is adapted for sponging, the stable fly mouth parts have biting structures.<ref name=Farmnote>{{cite web|last=Dadour|first=Ian|title=Stable Fly- Farmnote 101/1994|url=http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/PC_92852.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003644/http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/PC_92852.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 December 2013|work=Department of Agriculture and Food|publisher=Government of Western Australia|access-date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

==Habitat==
As its name suggests, the stable fly is abundant in and around where cattle are kept. Its maggots are often seen in the rotting manure near cattle and poultry.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=10633577|year=1999|last1=Cook|first1=DF|last2=Dadour|first2=IR|last3=Keals|first3=NJ|title=Stable fly, house fly (Diptera: Muscidae), and other nuisance fly development in poultry litter associated with horticultural crop production|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1352–7|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|doi=10.1093/jee/92.6.1352|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Biology==
[[File:Gemeine Stechfliege Stomoxys calcitrans Eiablage 0590.ogv|right|thumb|''Stomoxys calcitrans'' laying an egg]]
The earliest and one of the most comprehensive accounts of stable fly biology was presented by F. Bishop in 1913.<ref name=Bishop /> The adults of both sexes feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals during the daytime. For egg production, the female requires its abdomen to be engorged with blood. The female takes approximately 2–5 minutes to engorge, after which it becomes sluggish for a while. The eggs are laid among putrefying organic materials such as hay, manure, and wood. Males usually die after mating and the females after laying eggs. The life cycle has a duration of about two weeks at temperatures around {{Convert|27|°C|°F}}. The duration is highly dependent on temperature and nutrient quality available for the larvae. Bishop (1913) noted that the larvae can endure for more than 30 days in less nutritious environs.<ref name=Bishop />

==Economic importance==
Cattle heavily infested with stable flies have been noted to become [[Anemia|anemic]] and milking cows have been observed to show lower milk production.<ref>{{cite journal|year= 1997|title= Calculating Economic Injury Levels for Stable Flies (Diptera: Muscida) on Feeding Heifers|journal= Journal of Economic Entomology|volume= 90|issue=1|pages= 6–10|pmid=9071886|last1= Catangui|first1= MA|last2= Campbell|first2= JB|last3= Thomas|first3= GD|last4= Boxler|first4= DJ}}</ref> The stable fly bites humans at rest in the outdoors.
