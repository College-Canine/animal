'''Meibomian glands''' (also called '''tarsal glands''', '''palpebral glands''', and '''tarsoconjunctival glands''') are [[sebaceous gland]]s along the rims of the [[eyelid]] inside the [[tarsal plate]].  They produce '''meibum''', an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the [[eye|eye's]] [[tear film]].  Meibum prevents [[tears]] from spilling onto the cheek, traps them between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and makes the closed lids airtight.<ref>"eye, human."  Encyclopædia Britannica. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.</ref> There are about 25 such glands on the upper eyelid, and 20 on the lower eyelid.

[[Meibomian gland dysfunction|Dysfunctional meibomian glands]] is believed to be the most often cause of [[dry eye]]s. They are also the cause of [[blepharitis|posterior blepharitis]].<ref name="workshop-summary" />

==History==
[[File:Meibomian gland by heinrich meibom.png|thumb|left|First drawing of the meibomian gland by  [[Heinrich Meibom (doctor)|Heinrich Meibom]]. Year 1666.]]

The glands were mentioned by [[Galen]] in 200 AD<ref name="workshop-04">{{Cite journal|title=The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction: Report of the Subcommittee on Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology of the Meibomian Gland|year=2011|first1=Erich|last1=Knop |first2=Nadja |last2=Knop|first3=Thomas |last3=Millar|first4=Hiroto|last4=Obata|first5=David A.|last5=Sullivan|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1938–1978|doi=10.1167/iovs.10-6997c|pmid=21450915|pmc=3072159}}</ref> and were described in more detail by [[Heinrich Meibom (doctor)|Heinrich Meibom]] (1638–1700), a German physician, in his work ''De Vasis Palpebrarum Novis Epistola'' in 1666.

==Anatomy==
Although the upper lid have greater number and volume of meibomian glands than the lower lid, there is no consensus whether it contributes more to the tearfilm stability. The glands do not have direct contact with eyelash follicles. The process of blinking releases meibum into the lid margin.<ref name="workshop-summary">{{cite journal |title=The International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction: Executive Summary. |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science |author1=Kelly K.

==Function==
===Meibum===
====Lipids====
[[Lipid]]s are the major components of meibum (also known as "meibomian gland secretions"). The term "meibum" was originally introduced by Nicolaides ''et al.'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nicolaides | first1 = N | last2 = Kaitaranta | first2 = JK | last3 = Rawdah | first3 = TN | last4 = Macy | first4 = JI | last5 = Boswell | first5 = FM | last6 = Smith | first6 = RE | date = April 1981 | title = Meibomian gland studies: comparison of steer and human lipids | journal = Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 522–536 | pmid = 7194326 }}</ref>

The biochemical composition of meibum is extremely complex and very different from that of [[sebum]]. Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. An update{{clarify|date=December 2020}}  was published in 2009 on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Butovich IA|title=The Meibomian puzzle: combining pieces together|journal=Prog Retin Eye Res|date =November 2009|issue=6|volume=28|pages=483–498|pmid=19660571|doi=10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.07.002|pmc=2783885}}</ref>

Currently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is [[mass spectrometry]], either with direct infusion<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J |last2 = Green-Church | first2 = K |last3 = Nichols | first3 = K | year = 2010 | title = Shotgun lipidomic analysis of human meibomian gland secretions with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry| url =http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2126387 | journal =  Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci | volume = 51 | issue = 12| pages = 6220–6231 | pmid = 20671273 | doi=10.1167/iovs.10-5687 | pmc=3055753}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J | last2 = Nichols | first2 = K | year = 2018 | title = Comprehensive shotgun lipidomics of human meibomian gland secretions using MS/MSall with successive switching between acquisition polarity modes| url =http://www.jlr.org/content/59/11/2223.short | journal =  J Lipid Res | volume = 59 | issue = 11| pages = 2223–2236 | pmid = 30279222 | doi=10.1194/jlr.D088138  |doi-access=free | pmc=6210907}}</ref> or in combination with [[liquid chromatography]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Butovich | first1 = IA | year = 2009 | title = Lipidomic analysis of human meibum using HPLC-MS<sup>n</sup>| series = Methods Mol Biol | volume = 579 | pages = 221–246 | pmid = 19763478 | doi=10.1194/jlr.D088138 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The lipids are the main component of the lipid layer of the tear film, preventing rapid evaporation and it is believed they lower the surface tension which helps to stabilize the tear film.<ref name="workshop-04" />

====Proteins====
In humans, more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = PS | last2 = Evans | first2 = JE | last3 = Green | first3 = KM | last4 = Sullivan | first4 = RM | last5 = Schaumberg | first5 = DA | last6 = Richards | first6 = SM | last7 = Dana | first7 = MR | last8 = Sullivan | first8 = DA | date = March 2006 | title = Proteomic analysis of human meibomian gland secretions | journal = Br J Ophthalmol | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 372–7 | doi = 10.1136/bjo.2005.080846 | pmid = 16488965 | pmc=1856970}}</ref>

Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause [[dry eye]]s, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to [[blepharitis]]. Inflammation of the meibomian glands (also known as ''meibomitis'', ''meibomian gland dysfunction'', or ''posterior blepharitis'') causes the glands to be obstructed by thick, cloudy-to-yellow, more opaque and viscous-like, oily and waxy secretions, a change from the glands' normal clear secretions.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Meibomian gland disease: the role of gland dysfunction in dry eye disease |first1=Priyanka|last1=Chhadva |first2=Raquel|last2=Goldhardt |first3=Anat|last3=Galor |date=24 November 2017 |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=124 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S20–S26 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2017.05.031 |pmid=29055358 |pmc=5685175}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite book |author1=Peter Bex |author2=Reza Dana |author3=Linda Mcloon |author4=Jerry Niederkorn |date=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jr1dBAKMM-cC&dq=%22meibomian+gland+dysfunction%22&pg=PA98 |title=Ocular Periphery and Disorders |via=books.google.com |isbn=9780123820426 |access-date=2023-10-30}}</ref> Besides leading to dry eyes, the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial [[lipase]]s, resulting in the formation of free [[fatty acid]]s, which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|punctate keratopathy]].

Meibomian gland dysfunction is more often seen in women and is regarded as the main cause of [[dry eye disease]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revophth.com/content/d/dry_eye/c/36944 |title=Managing and Making Sense of MGD |publisher=Review of Ophthalmology |date=2012 |access-date=26 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aao.org/publications/eyenet/201107/cornea.cfm |title=Rethinking Meibomian Gland Dysfunction: How to Spot It, Stage It and Treat It |publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology |date=2014 |access-date=26 February 2014}}</ref> Factors that contribute to meibomian gland dysfunction can include things such as a person's age and/or hormones,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aaopt.org/mdl/meeting/AttachmentViewer?id=10540 |title=The Role of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction and Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy in Dry Eye Disease |publisher=American Academy of Optometry |date=2012 |access-date=26 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009132625/http://www.aaopt.org/mdl/meeting/AttachmentViewer?id=10540 |archive-date=9 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> or severe infestation of [[Demodex brevis]] mite.

Treatment can include [[warm compresses]] to thin the secretions and eyelid scrubs with a commercial eyelid cleanser or baby shampoo,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Efficacy of baby shampoo and commercial eyelid cleanser in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction|first1=Orapan|last1=Aryasit|first2=Yuwarat|last2=Uthairat|first3=Penny|last3=Singha|first4=Orasa|last4=Horatanaruang|date=8 May 2020|journal=Medicine|volume=99|issue=19|pages=e20155|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000020155|pmid=32384504|pmc=7220370}}</ref><ref name="auto"/> or emptying ("expression") of the gland by a professional. [[Lifitegrast]] and [[Restasis]] are topical medication commonly used to control the inflammation and improve the oil quality. In some cases, topical [[steroid]]s and topical (drops or ointment)/oral [[antibiotic]]s (to reduce bacteria on the lid margin) are also prescribed to reduce inflammation.<ref name="auto"/>  [[Intense pulsed light]] (IPL) treatments have also been shown to reduce inflammation and improve gland function.  Meibomian gland probing is also used on patients who experience deep clogging of the glands.

Meibomian gland dysfunction may be caused by some [[pharmaceutical drug|prescription medications]], notably [[isotretinoin]]. A blocked meibomian gland can cause a [[chalazion]] (or "meibomian cyst") to form in the eyelid.
