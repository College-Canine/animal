'''''Uncinaria stenocephala''''' is a [[nematode]] that [[Parasitism|parasitizes]] [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[fox]]es as well as humans. It is rare to find in cats in the United States. ''Uncinaria stenocephala'' is the most common canine hookworm in cooler regions, such as Canada and the northern regions of the US, where it can be found primarily in foxes (40%).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/gastrointestinal-parasites-of-small-animals/hookworms-in-small-animals?query=uncinaria%20stenocephala|title=Hookworms in Small Animals - Digestive System|website=Merck Veterinary Manual|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> ''U. stenocephala'' is also one of the most common hookworms in the UK, called the northern hookworm, however it has a rather low prevalence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://veterinary-practice.com/article/canine-hookworm-dermatitis-uncinariasis|title=Canine hookworm dermatitis (uncinariasis)|website=veterinary-practice.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> ''U. stenocephala is'' also considered to be zoonotic hookworms because they live in animals but can be transmitted to humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/zoonotichookworm/index.html|title=CDC - Zoonotic Hookworm|date=2019-04-25|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>

== Life cycle ==
The host ingests an infective third stage [[larva]]. The larva matures to the adult in the small intestine.  Eggs are laid in the small intestine and pass out with the feces. The prepatent period is about 15 to 17 days. The eggs hatch in the soil and the larvae molt twice to reach the infective third-stage.<ref name=CAPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.capcvet.org/recommendations/hookworms.html|publisher=Companion Animal Parasite Council|title=Intestinal Parasites - Hookworms|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> Infections worsen and amplify when dogs who are regularly kept outside are not routinely dewormed.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=Shirley|last2=Myers|first2=Sherry L.|last3=Wagner|first3=Brent|last4=Snead|first4=Elisabeth C.R.|date=August 2013|title=Hookworm dermatitis due to ''Uncinaria stenocephala'' in a dog from Saskatchewan|journal=The Canadian Veterinary Journal|volume=54|issue=8|pages=743–747|issn=0008-5286|pmc=3711160|pmid=24155473}}</ref>

Adult worms may live for 4 to 24 months in the small intestine. Dog and cat hookworms range in size from 10 to 20&nbsp;mm by 0.4 to 0.5&nbsp;mm and the eggs are 71 to 93 μm by 35 to 58&nbsp;µm.<ref name=CAPC /> A study shown a high number of eggs per female ''U. stenocephala'' worm was measured at over 5,000 eggs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rep|first1=B. H.|last2=Bos|first2=R.|date=1979-10-01|title=Enige epidemiologische aspecten van Uncinaria stenocephala infectie in Nederland |trans-title=Epidemiological aspects of ''Uncinaria stenocephala'' infections in the Netherlands |journal=Tijdschrift voor Diergeneeskunde |volume=104|issue=19|pages=747–758|issn=0040-7453|pmid=573511}}</ref>

Adult parasites are most often found in their hosts' [[small intestine]].

A second type of infection occurs with transdermal larval infection into the dog's skin, usually made possible by warm weather and humidity which allows the larvae to grow in the environment.<ref name=":1" /> These transdermal infections are not very significant in ''U. stenocephala'' because about 2.3% ± 1.3% of infective larvae actually reach the small intestine to finish its life cycle.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnostic Stage:
* Eggs are found in [[fecal flotation]].
* Eggs measure 75&nbsp;um long by 45&nbsp;um wide.

Common Diagnostic Test
* Fecal float to recover eggs.

Clinical Signs:
*''U. stenocephala'' ingests plasma protein rather than whole blood, so the loss of nutrients is evident.
*All hookworms suck blood, they are capable of removing 0.1mL of blood per worm, per 24-hour period.
* Light infections are asymptomatic.
* Infected pups may present with pale mucus membranes and anemia, ill thrift, failure to gain weight, poor hair coat, dehydration, and dark, tarry diarrhea (melena). Puppies harboring many worms will develop an acute normocytic, normochromic anemia followed by hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. Without immediate intervention, these animals may die of the infection. Those that survive may continue as "poor doers" with chronic anemia.<ref name=CAPC />

''U. stenocephala'' is considered a zoonotic hookworm and can cause a few different diseases in humans, including [[cutaneous larva migrans]].<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2006.03.012|pmid=16682029|title=''Uncinaria stenocephala'': Assessment of antigens for the immunodiagnosis of canine uncinariosis|journal=Experimental Parasitology|volume=114|issue=3|pages=215–219|year=2006|last1=Postigo|first1=I.|last2=Martinez|first2=J.|last3=Guisantes|first3=J.A.}}</ref> Humans become infected when the larvae penetrate unprotected skin due to contaminated animal feces in the environment.

== Treatment/Prevention ==
Effective treatment of ''U. stenocephala'' includes proper medical treatment and the proper choice of anthelmintic. It is recommended for infected animals to have their feces examined 3 weeks after treatment is complete.<ref name=":1" />

[[Febantel]], Febantel/Pyrantel embonate, [[Fenbendazole]], [[Ivermectin]], [[Mebendazole]], [[Pyrantel Pamoate]]

Heartworm prevention products that include Ivermectin/Pyrantal/Praziquantel or Moxidectin are good at controlling ''U. stenocephala'' in dogs.<ref name=":0" />
