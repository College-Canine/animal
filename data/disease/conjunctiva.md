In the [[anatomy]] of the [[eye]], the '''conjunctiva''' ({{plural abbr| '''conjunctivae'''}}) is a thin [[mucous membrane]] that lines the inside of the [[eyelid]]s and covers the [[sclera]] (the white of the eye).<ref name="SD">{{cite web |title=Conjunctiva |url=https://sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/conjunctiva |website=www.sciencedirect.com |access-date=4 August 2022}}</ref> It is composed of non-keratinized, [[stratified squamous epithelium]] with [[goblet cell]]s, [[stratified columnar epithelium]] and [[stratified cuboidal epithelium]] (depending on the zone). The conjunctiva is highly [[Angiogenesis|vascularised]], with many [[microvessel]]s easily accessible for imaging studies.

== Structure ==
The conjunctiva is typically divided into three parts:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Part
! Area
|-
| Palpebral or tarsal conjunctiva
| Lines the eyelids
|-
| Bulbar or ocular conjunctiva
| Covers the eyeball, over the anterior [[sclera]]: This region of the conjunctiva is tightly bound to the underlying sclera by [[Tenon's capsule]] and moves with the eyeball movements. The average thickness of the bulbar conjunctival membrane is 33 microns.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Efron N, Al-Dossari M, Pritchard N | title = In vivo confocal microscopy of the bulbar conjunctiva | journal = Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 335–44 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19594558 | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2009.02065.x | s2cid = 35398240 }}</ref>
|-
| Fornix conjunctiva
| Forms the junction between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctivas:  It is loose and flexible, allowing the free movement of the lids and eyeball.<ref>Eye, human Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>
|}

===Blood supply===
Blood to the bulbar conjunctiva is primarily derived from the ophthalmic artery. The blood supply to the palpebral conjunctiva (the eyelid) is derived from the [[external carotid artery]]. However, the circulations of the bulbar conjunctiva and palpebral conjunctiva are linked, so both bulbar conjunctival and palpebral conjunctival vessels are supplied by both the ophthalmic artery and the external carotid artery, to varying extents.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pavlou AT, Wolff HG | title = The bulbar conjunctival vessels in occlusion of the internal carotid artery | journal = A.M.A. Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 104 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–60 | date = July 1959 | pmid = 13660526 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.1959.00270070055007 }}</ref>

===Nerve supply===
Sensory innervation of the conjunctiva is divided into four parts:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u06/u06_b06.htm |title=Table 1: Summary of sensory nerve supply |access-date=July 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214055618/http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u06/u06_b06.htm |archive-date=February 14, 2013 }}</ref>

===Microanatomy===
The conjunctiva consists of unkeratinized, both stratified squamous and stratified columnar epithelium, with interspersed [[goblet cells]].<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book| vauthors = Goldman L |title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|year=2012|url=https://archive.org/details/goldmanscecilmed00mdle|url-access=limited|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1437727883|page=[https://archive.org/details/goldmanscecilmed00mdle/page/n2974 2426]|edition=24th}}</ref> The epithelial layer contains blood vessels, fibrous tissue, and lymphatic channels.<ref name=Cecil /> [[Accessory lacrimal glands]] in the conjunctiva constantly produce the aqueous portion of tears.<ref name=Cecil /> Additional cells present in the conjunctival epithelium include [[melanocytes]], [[Lymphocyte|T and B cell lymphocytes]].<ref name=Cecil />

== Function ==
The conjunctiva helps lubricate the eye by producing [[mucus]] and [[tears]], although a smaller volume of [[tears]] than the [[lacrimal gland]].<ref>London Place Eye Center (2003). [http://www.lasereye.com/conjuc.htm Conjunctivitis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040808182217/http://lasereye.com/conjuc.htm |date=2004-08-08 }}. Retrieved July 25, 2004.</ref>
It also contributes to [[immune system|immune surveillance]] and helps to prevent the entrance of [[microbes]] into the eye.

==Clinical significance==

Disorders of the conjunctiva and [[cornea]] are common sources of eye complaints, in particular because the surface of the eye is exposed to various external influences and is especially susceptible to [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[infections]], chemical irritation, [[allergic reactions]], and [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dryness]].

== Bulbar conjunctival microvasculature ==
=== Vessel morphology ===
The bulbar conjunctival [[Microvessel|microvasculature]] contains [[arteriole]]s, [[Metarteriole|meta-arterioles]], [[venule]]s, [[Capillary|capillaries]], and communicating vessels. Vessel morphology varies greatly between subjects and even between regions of the individual eyes. In some subjects, arterioles and venules can be seen to run parallel with each other. Paired arterioles are generally smaller than corresponding venules.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meighan SS | title = Blood vessels of the bulbar conjunctiva in man | journal = The British Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 513–26 | date = September 1956 | pmid = 13364178 | pmc = 1324675 | doi = 10.1136/bjo.40.9.513 }}</ref> The average bulbar conjunctival vessel has been reported to be 15.1 microns, which reflects the high number of small capillaries, which are typically <10  microns in diameter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shahidi M, Wanek J, Gaynes B, Wu T | title = Quantitative assessment of conjunctival microvascular circulation of the human eye | journal = Microvascular Research | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–13 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20053367 | pmc = 3253734 | doi = 10.1016/j.mvr.2009.12.003 }}</ref>

=== Blood oxygen dynamics ===
The bulbar conjunctival microvasculature is in close proximity to ambient air, thus [[Diffusion|oxygen diffusion]] from ambient air strongly influences their [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|blood oxygen saturation]]. Because of oxygen diffusion, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] bulbar conjunctival vessels will rapidly reoxygenate (in under 10 seconds) when exposed to ambient air (i.e. when the eyelid is open). Closing the eyelid stops this oxygen diffusion by placing a barrier between the bulbar conjunctival microvessels and ambient air.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = MacKenzie LE, Choudhary TR, McNaught AI, Harvey AR | title = In vivo oximetry of human bulbar conjunctival and episcleral microvasculature using snapshot multispectral imaging | journal = Experimental Eye Research | volume = 149 | pages = 48–58 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27317046 | doi = 10.1016/j.exer.2016.06.008 | s2cid = 25038785 | url = http://dro.dur.ac.uk/25017/1/25017.pdf }}</ref>
