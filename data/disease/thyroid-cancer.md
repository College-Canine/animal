==Signs and symptoms==

Most often, the first symptom of thyroid cancer is a nodule in the thyroid region of the neck.<ref name="hu" /> However, up to 65% of adults have small nodules in their thyroids, but typically under 10% of these nodules are found to be cancerous.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Durante C, Grani G, Lamartina L, Filetti S, Mandel SJ, Cooper DS | title = The Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Nodules: A Review | journal = JAMA | volume = 319 | issue = 9 | pages = 914–924 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29509871 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2018.0898 | s2cid = 5042725 }}</ref> Sometimes, the first sign is an enlarged lymph node. Later symptoms that can be present are pain in the anterior region of the neck and changes in voice due to an involvement of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-01 |title=Thyroid Cancer |url=https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/cancer-types-care/types/thyroid-cancer/about-thyroid-cancer |access-date=2023-02-05 |website=Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) - New York |language=en |archive-date=5 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205115020/https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/cancer-types-care/types/thyroid-cancer/about-thyroid-cancer |url-status=live }}</ref>

Thyroid cancer is usually found in a [[euthyroid]] patient, but symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] or [[hypothyroidism]] may be associated with a large or metastatic, well-differentiated tumor. [[Thyroid nodules]] are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20. The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely, thus the potential for malignancy is far greater.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Causes==
Thyroid cancers are thought to be related to a number of environmental and genetic predisposing factors, but significant uncertainty remains regarding their causes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thyroid Cancer Overview - Signaling Pathway.

Environmental exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from both natural background sources and artificial sources is suspected to play a significant role, and significantly increased rates of thyroid cancer occur in those exposed to mantlefield radiation for [[lymphoma]], and those exposed to [[iodine-131]] following the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Radioactive I-131 from Fallout|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes/i131|publisher=National Cancer Institute|access-date=9 June 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519094306/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes/i131/|archive-date=19 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]], [[Kyshtym disaster|Kyshtym]], and [[Windscale fire|Windscale]]<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal | vauthors = dos Santos Silva I, Swerdlow AJ | title = Thyroid cancer epidemiology in England and Wales: time trends and geographical distribution | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 330–340 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 8431362 | pmc = 1968194 | doi = 10.1038/bjc.1993.61 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> nuclear disasters.<ref>{{cite web|title = Experts link higher incidence of children's cancer to Fukushima radiation|url = http://www.sciencealert.com/experts-link-higher-incidence-of-children-s-cancer-to-fukushima-radiation|website = ScienceAlert| date=12 October 2015 |access-date = 15 January 2016|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160119111805/http://www.sciencealert.com/experts-link-higher-incidence-of-children-s-cancer-to-fukushima-radiation|archive-date = 19 January 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> [[Thyroiditis]] and other thyroid diseases also predispose to thyroid cancer.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pacini F, Castagna MG, Brilli L, Pentheroudakis G | title = Thyroid cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 21 | issue = Suppl 5 | pages = v214–v219 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20555084 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdq190 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Spread===
Thyroid cancer can spread directly, via lymphatics or blood. Direct spread occurs through infiltration of the surrounding tissues. The tumor infiltrates into [[infrahyoid muscle]]s, trachea, oesophagus, [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], [[carotid sheath]], etc. The tumor then becomes fixed. Anaplastic carcinoma spreads mostly by direct spread, while papillary carcinoma spreads so the least. Lymphatic spread is most common in papillary carcinoma. [[Cervical lymph node]]s become palpable in papillary carcinoma even when the primary tumor is unpalpable. [[Deep cervical node]]s, pretracheal, prelaryngeal, and paratracheal groups of lymph nodes are often affected. The lymph node affected is usually the same side as that of the location of the tumor. Blood spread is also possible in thyroid cancers, especially in follicular and anaplastic carcinoma. The tumor emboli do angioinvasion of lungs; end of long bones, skull, and vertebrae are affected. Pulsating metastases occur because of their increased vascularity.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Das S |title=A concise textbook of surgery|date=2008|publisher=Dr S.

==Prognosis==
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2014}}
The prognosis of thyroid cancer is related to the type of cancer and the stage at the time of diagnosis.  For the most common form of thyroid cancer, papillary, the overall prognosis is excellent. Indeed, the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in recent years is likely related to increased and earlier diagnosis. One can look at the trend to earlier diagnosis in two ways. The first is that many of these cancers are small and not likely to develop into aggressive malignancies. A second perspective is that earlier diagnosis removes these cancers at a time when they are not likely to have spread beyond the thyroid gland, thereby improving the long-term outcome for the patient. No consensus exists at present on whether this trend toward earlier diagnosis is beneficial or unnecessary.

The argument against early diagnosis and treatment is based on the logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This view holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are [[overdiagnosed]] that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer.  Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers.<ref name=Welch />  Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with [[autopsy]] studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one-third of older adults technically have thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm.<ref name=Welch />  Detecting nodules that might be cancerous is easy, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis. Benign (noncancerous) nodules frequently co-exist with thyroid cancer; sometimes, a benign nodule is discovered, but surgery uncovers an incidental small thyroid cancer. Increasingly, small thyroid nodules are discovered as incidental findings on imaging (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound) performed for another purpose; very few of these people with accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has the potential to cause harm to them, not to help them.<ref name=Welch>{{cite book| vauthors = Welch HG, Schwartz L, Woloshin S | title = Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health| publisher = Beacon Press| location = [Malaysia?]| year = 2011| pages = 61–34| isbn = 978-0-8070-2200-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofman MS | title = Thyroid nodules: time to stop over-reporting normal findings and update consensus guidelines | journal = BMJ | volume = 347 | pages = f5742 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24068719 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.f5742 | s2cid = 5660811 }}</ref>

The table below highlights some of the challenges with decision making and prognostication in thyroid cancer. While general agreement exists that stage I or II papillary, follicular, or medullary cancer have  good prognoses,  when evaluating a small thyroid cancer to determine which ones will grow and metastasize and which will not is not possible. As a result, once a diagnosis of thyroid cancer has been established (most commonly by a fine needle aspiration),  a total thyroidectomy likely will be performed.

This drive to earlier diagnosis has also manifested itself on the European continent by the use of serum calcitonin measurements in patients with goiter to identify patients with early abnormalities of the parafollicular or calcitonin-producing cells within the thyroid gland. As multiple studies have demonstrated, the finding of an elevated serum calcitonin is associated with the finding of a medullary thyroid carcinoma in as high as 20% of cases.

In Europe where the threshold for thyroid surgery is lower than in the United States, an elaborate strategy that incorporates serum calcitonin measurements and stimulatory tests for calcitonin has been incorporated into the decision to perform a thyroidectomy; thyroid experts in the United States, looking at the same data, have for the most part not incorporated calcitonin testing as a routine part of their evaluations, thereby eliminating a large number of thyroidectomies and the consequent morbidity. The European thyroid community has focused on prevention of metastasis from small medullary thyroid carcinomas; the North American thyroid community has focused more on prevention of complications associated with thyroidectomy (see [[American Thyroid Association]] guidelines below). <!-- It is not clear at this time who is correct.
 -->
As demonstrated in the table below, individuals with stage III and IV disease have a significant risk of dying from thyroid cancer. While many present with widely metastatic disease, an equal number evolve over years and decades from stage I or II disease. Physicians who manage thyroid cancer of any stage recognize that a small percentage of patients with low-risk thyroid cancer will progress to metastatic disease.

Improvements have been made in thyroid cancer treatment during recent years. The identification of some of the molecular or DNA abnormalities  has led to the development of therapies that target these molecular defects. The first of these agents to negotiate the approval process is [[vandetanib]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the ''[[RET proto-oncogene]]'', two subtypes of the [[vascular endothelial growth factor receptor]], and the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm250168.htm|title=FDA approves new treatment for rare form of thyroid cancer|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=6 April 2011|access-date=7 April 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410130203/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm250168.htm|archive-date=10 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  More of these compounds are under investigation and are likely to make it through the approval process. For differentiated thyroid carcinoma, strategies are evolving to use selected types of targeted therapy to increase radioactive iodine uptake in papillary thyroid carcinomas that have lost the ability to concentrate iodide. This strategy would make possible the use of radioactive iodine therapy to treat "resistant" thyroid cancers. Other targeted therapies are being evaluated, making  life extension possible over the next 5–10 years for those with stage III and IV thyroid cancer.

Prognosis is better in younger people than older ones.<ref name=european/>
