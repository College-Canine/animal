'''Masticatory muscle myositis''' (MMM) is an inflammatory disease in [[dog]]s affecting the [[muscle]]s of mastication (chewing).  It is also known as '''atrophic myositis''' or '''eosinophilic myositis'''.  MMM is the most common inflammatory [[myopathy]] in dogs.<ref name=Neumann>{{cite journal |vauthors=Neumann J, Bilzer T |title=Evidence for MHC I-restricted CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunopathology in canine masticatory muscle myositis and polymyositis |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=215–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16270307 |doi=10.1002/mus.20456}}</ref>  The disease mainly affects large breed dogs.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

Symptoms of acute MMM include swelling of the jaw muscles, drooling, and pain on opening the mouth.  Ophthalmic signs may include [[nictitating membrane|third eyelid]] protrusion, red eyes, and [[exophthalmos]] (protruding eyeballs).<ref>{{cite web | last = Gelatt | first = Kirk | title = Treatment of Orbital Diseases in Small Animals | work = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2641 | accessdate = 2007-02-10 }}</ref>  In chronic MMM there is [[atrophy]] of the jaw muscles, and scarring of the masticatory muscles due to [[fibrosis]] may result in inability to open the mouth ([[trismus]]).  The affected muscles include the [[Temporalis muscle|temporalis]], [[Masseter muscle|masseter]], and [[Lateral pterygoid muscle|pterygoid muscle]]s.  The disease is usually bilateral.

MMM is caused by the presence of [[2M fiber]]s in the muscles of the jaw.  2M fibers are not found elsewhere in the body.  The [[immune system]] recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in [[inflammation]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Diagnosis of MMM is through either [[biopsy]] of the temporalis or masseter muscles or the 2M antibody assay, in which blood serum of the possible MMM-dog is reacted with temporalis tissue of a normal dog, or both. False negatives by the 2M antibody assay may be obtained if MMM is end-stage with destruction of type 2M fibers and marked fibrosis. Treatment is usually with [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[prednisone]], often with decreasing doses for up to 4–6 months, and in the case of trismus, manual opening of the mouth under [[anesthesia]].<ref name=Chrisman_2003>{{cite book|author1=Chrisman, Cheryl |author2=Clemmons, Roger |author3=Mariani, Christopher |author4=Platt, Simon |title=Neurology for the Small Animal Practitioner|edition=1st|publisher=Teton New Media|year=2003|isbn=1-893441-82-2}}</ref>  Feeding very soft or liquid food during this time is usually necessary. The ultimate degree of recovery of jaw function and muscle mass will depend upon the extent of damage to the muscle tissue. Recurrence of MMM may occur.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clooten J, Woods J, Smith-Maxie L |title=Myasthenia gravis and masticatory muscle myositis in a dog |journal=Can Vet J |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=480–3 |year=2003 |pmid=12839242 |pmc=340171}}</ref>  Misdiagnosis of MMM as a retroorbital [[abscess]] based on physical examination and finding of trismus leads to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, which will not impede the progress of MMM.
