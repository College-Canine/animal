'''Malignant histiocytosis'''  is a rare [[hereditary disease]] found in the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] and humans, characterized by [[histiocyte|histiocytic]] infiltration of the lungs and [[lymph node]]s.  The [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[central nervous system]] can also be affected.  Histiocytes are a component of the [[immune system]] that proliferate abnormally in this disease.  In addition to its importance in veterinary medicine, the condition is also important in human pathology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dermnetnz.org/topics/malignant-histiocytoses|title=Malignant histiocytoses &#124; DermNet NZ|website=dermnetnz.org}}</ref>

==Histiocytic disorders==
A histiocyte is a differentiated tissue cell that has its origin in the [[bone marrow]].  The source for histiocytes is the [[monocyte]]/[[macrophage]] line.  Monocytes (found in the blood) and macrophages (found in tissue) are responsible for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion) of foreign material in the body.  [[Langerhans cell]]s are [[dendritic cell]]s found in the skin and function by internalizing [[antigen]]s (foreign particles) and presenting them to [[T cell]]s.  They arise from monocytes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ginhoux F, Tacke F, Angeli V, Bogunovic M, Loubeau M, Dai XM, Stanley ER, Randolph GJ, Merad M |title=Langerhans cells arise from monocytes in vivo |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=265–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16444257 |doi=10.1038/ni1307|pmc=4727824 }}</ref>  Histiocytic disorders refer to diseases that are caused by abnormal behavior of these cells.  They include the following:
* Reactive diseases of Langerhans cells (most important feature in immune histochemistry is expression of E-cadherin)
** [[Histiocytoma (dog)|Histiocytoma]]s
* Reactive histiocytosis (immunohistochemical features show that interstitial/dermal DCs are involved)
** Cutaneous [[histiocytosis]] (CH)
** Systemic histiocytosis (SH)
* Reactive diseases of macrophages
** [[Hemophagocytic syndrome]] – a condition where macrophages phagocytose [[myeloid]] and [[erythroid]] precursors (similar to [[HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)|hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]] in humans)
* Histiocytic sarcoma complex (immunohistochemical features of dendritic cells, possibly interdigitating or perivascular DCs)
** Malignant histiocytosis
** Diffuse [[histiocytic sarcoma]]
** Localized histiocytic sarcoma
* Malignant diseases of macrophages
** [[Histiocytic lymphoma]]

==Breed disposition==
Up to 25 percent of Bernese Mountain Dogs may develop malignant histiocytosis in their lifetime.<ref>E Cadieu, B Hedan, G Parker H, Gr Rutteman, A Baffoe-Bonnie, et al..

==Signs and symptoms==
The disease in the lungs is characterized by enlargement of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and infiltration of the lungs, sometimes leading to lung lobe consolidation and [[pleural effusion]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kessler, Martin|year=2006|title=Radiographic diagnosis of primary and metastatic lung tumors|work=Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference|url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/275.pdf?LA=1|access-date=2007-01-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105002/http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/275.pdf?LA=1|archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>  Signs and symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia, and difficulty breathing.<ref>{{cite web | last = Affolter | first = Verena K. | title = Histiocytic Proliferative Diseases in Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8600&O=Generic | access-date = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  [[Seizure]]s and rear limb weakness can be seen.  Invasion of the bone marrow can cause [[pancytopenia]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kearns | first = Shawn Ann |author2=Ewing, Patty | title = Causes of canine and feline pancytopenia | journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–133 | publisher = Veterinary Learning Systems | date = Feb 2006 }}</ref>  Diagnosis requires a [[biopsy]].

==Treatment==
Treatment with [[chemotherapy]] has been used with some success, particularly using [[lomustine]], [[prednisone]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[cyclophosphamide]].<ref name=DVM>{{cite journal | last = Cronin | first = Kim | title = Deciphering the histiocytic code | journal = DVM | pages = 1S–8S | publisher = Advanstar Communications | date = Dec 2006 }}</ref>  Because of the rapid progression of this aggressive disease, the [[prognosis]] is very poor.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Affolter V, Moore P |s2cid=17366063 |title=Localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcoma of dendritic cell origin in dogs |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=74–83 |year=2002 |pmid=12102221 |doi=10.1354/vp.39-1-74}}</ref>

==Other histiocytic diseases in Bernese Mountain Dogs==
A similar disease is '''diffuse histiocytic sarcoma''', a term used to designate a localized histiocytic sarcoma that has spread throughout the body. Other signs and symptoms include weight loss and loss of appetite.<ref name=DVM/>{{better source|reason=Website, not peer reviewed journal|date=July 2020}}
