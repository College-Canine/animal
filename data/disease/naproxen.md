<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Naproxen''', sold under the brand name '''Aleve''' among others, is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) used to treat pain, [[menstrual cramp]]s, and [[inflammatory diseases]] such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[gout]] and [[fever]].<ref name=AHFS2018/> It is [[Oral administration|taken orally]].<ref name=AHFS2018/> It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations.<ref name=AHFS2018/> Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours.<ref name=AHFS2018/>

<!-- Side effects -->
Common side effects include dizziness, [[headache]], [[bruising]], allergic reactions, [[heartburn]], and stomach pain.<ref name=AHFS2018/> Severe side effects include an increased risk of [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], and [[stomach ulcers]].<ref name=AHFS2018/> The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs.<ref name=AHFS2018/> It is not recommended in people with [[kidney problems]].<ref name=AHFS2018/> Use is not recommended in the [[third trimester of pregnancy]].<ref name=AHFS2018/>

<!-- Mechanism -->
Naproxen is a nonselective [[Cyclooxygenase|COX]] inhibitor.<ref name=AHFS2018/> As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called [[prostaglandins]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McEvoy GK |title=AHFS Drug Information, 2000 |date=2000 |publisher=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |isbn=9781585280049 |page=1854 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3iynUKXWoYC }}</ref> It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.<ref name=AHFS2018/>

== Medical uses ==
Naproxen's medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound.<ref name="Naprosyn label" /> Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive [[inflammation]], such as [[pain]] and [[fever]] (naproxen has fever-reducing, or [[antipyretic]], properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity).<ref name="Naprosyn label" /> Naproxen's anti-inflammatory properties may relieve pain caused by inflammatory conditions such as [[migraine]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[kidney stones]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[gout]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[menstrual cramp]]s, [[tendinitis]], and [[bursitis]].<ref name="drugs" >{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/naproxen.html|title=Naproxen|publisher=Drugs.com|date=2017|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref>

===Available formulations===
Naproxen sodium is available as both an immediate release and as an extended release tablet. The extended release formulations (sometimes called "sustained release", or "enteric coated") take longer to take effect than the immediate release formulations, and therefore are less useful when immediate pain relief is desired. Extended release formulations are more useful for the treatment of chronic, or long-lasting, conditions, in which long-term pain relief is desirable.<ref name="L490 Pill Identification"/>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
As with all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), naproxen use should be avoided in pregnancy due to the importance of prostaglandins in vascular and renal function in the fetus. NSAIDs should especially be avoided in the third trimester. Small amounts of naproxen are excreted in breast milk.<ref name=drugs/> However, adverse effects are uncommon in infants breastfed from a mother taking naproxen.<ref name="LactMed">{{cite web|title=LACTMED: NAPROXEN|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/f?./temp/~H9DD3g:1|website=TOXNET|publisher=NIH|access-date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet [[thromboxane]] throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet [[COX-1]] and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Naproxen is a minor substrate of [[CYP1A2]] and [[CYP2C9]]. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vree TB, van den Biggelaar-Martea M, Verwey-van Wissen CP, Vree JB, Guelen PJ | title = Pharmacokinetics of naproxen, its metabolite O-desmethylnaproxen, and their acyl glucuronides in humans | journal = Biopharmaceutics & Drug Disposition | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 491–502 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 8218967 | doi = 10.1002/bdd.2510140605 | s2cid = 35920001 }}</ref> An analysis of two [[clinical trials]] shows that naproxen's time to [[Cmax (pharmacology)|peak plasma concentration]] occurs between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration, though naproxen sodium reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours.<ref name="CV Safety Review Article" >{{cite journal|author-link1=Dominick Angiolillo | vauthors = Angiolillo DJ, Weisman SM | title = Clinical Pharmacology and Cardiovascular Safety of Naproxen | journal = American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–107 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27826802 | pmc = 5340840 | doi = 10.1007/s40256-016-0200-5 }}</ref>{{what|date=December 2021}}

=== Pharmacogenetics ===

=== Toxicology scandal ===
Naproxen was one of the four substances named in the prosecution of [[Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories]] (IBT) for fraudulent toxicology testing.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=gpng0055 | title=Industry Documents Library }}</ref> Naproxen passed subsequent legitimate toxicology testing.

==Research==
Naproxen may have antiviral activity against [[influenza]]. In laboratory research, it blocks the RNA-binding groove of the nucleoprotein of the virus, preventing formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex—thus taking the viral nucleoproteins out of circulation.<ref name="pmid23459490">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lejal N, Tarus B, Bouguyon E, Chenavas S, Bertho N, Delmas B, Ruigrok RW, Di Primo C, Slama-Schwok A | display-authors = 6 | title = Structure-based discovery of the novel antiviral properties of naproxen against the nucleoprotein of influenza A virus | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 2231–42 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23459490 | pmc = 3632891 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.02335-12 }}<br>Lay summary at: {{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/561119|title=Pain reliever shows anti-viral activity against flu|website=EurekAlert!}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==

Naproxen is given by mouth to horses at a dose of 10{{nbsp}}mg/kg, and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at three times the recommended dose for 42 days).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE |title=Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs |journal=Proceedings of the Annual Convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners |volume=47 |year=2001 |pages=182–187 |issn=0065-7182 }}</ref> It is more effective for [[myositis]] than the commonly used NSAID [[phenylbutazone]], and has shown especially good results for treatment of [[equine exertional rhabdomyolysis]],<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = May SA, Lees P |chapter=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs | veditors = McIlwraith CW, Trotter GW |title=Joint disease in the horse |location=Philadelphia |publisher=WB Saunders |year=1996 |pages=223–237 |isbn=0-7216-5135-6 }}</ref> a disease of muscle breakdown; it is less commonly used for [[musculoskeletal disease]].{{medcn|date=December 2019}}
