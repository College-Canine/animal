The latter three infections are not well studied.  Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis was recently discovered and has low reporting numbers due to the fact that it is relatively new and because its symptoms are very similar to the symptoms caused by other Ehrlichia bacteria.

In 2008, human infection by a [[Panola Mountain]] (in Georgia, USA) ''Ehrlichia'' species was reported.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reeves WK, Loftis AD, Nicholson WL, Czarkowski AG |title=The first report of human illness associated with the Panola Mountain Ehrlichia species: a case report |journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports |volume=2 |pages=139 |year=2008 |pmid=18447934 |pmc=2396651 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-139 |doi-access=free }}</ref> On August 3, 2011, infection by a yet-unnamed bacterium in the genus ''Ehrlichia'' was reported, carried by [[Ixodes scapularis|deer ticks]] and causing [[flu-like]] symptoms in at least 25 people in [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]].

''Ehrlichia'' species are transported between cells through the host-cell [[filopodia]] during the initial stages of infection; whereas, in the final stages of infection, the pathogen ruptures the host cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas S, Popov VL, Walker DH |title=Exit Mechanisms of the Intracellular ''Bacterium Ehrlichia'' |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e15775 |year=2010 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015775 |pmid=21187937 |pmc=3004962 |editor1-last=Kaushal |editor1-first=Deepak|bibcode=2010PLoSO...515775T |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms in humans==
Specific symptoms include fever, chills, severe headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, confusion, and a splotchy or pinpoint rash.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Meghan|last2=Yokoe|first2=Deborah S.|last3=Stelling|first3=John|last4=Kaganov|first4=Rebecca E.|last5=Letourneau|first5=Alyssa R.|last6=O'Brien|first6=Thomas|last7=Kulldorff|first7=Martin|last8=Babalola|first8=Damilola|last9=Barrett|first9=Craig|last10=Drees|first10=Marci|last11=Platt|first11=Richard|date=2015|title=Automated Outbreak Detection of Hospital-Associated Infections|journal=Open Forum Infectious Diseases|volume=2|issue=suppl_1|doi=10.1093/ofid/ofv131.60|issn=2328-8957|doi-access=free}}</ref>  More severe symptoms include brain or nervous system damage, respiratory failure, uncontrollable bleeding, organ failure, and death.  Ehrlichiosis can also blunt the immune system by suppressing production of [[TNF-alpha]], which may lead to opportunistic infections such as [[candidiasis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Most of the signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis can likely be ascribed to the immune dysregulation that it causes.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A "[[toxic shock]]-like" syndrome is seen in some severe cases of ehrlichiosis. Some cases can present with [[purpura]] and in one such case, the organisms were present in such overwhelming numbers that in 1991, Dr. Aileen Marty of the [[AFIP]] was able to demonstrate the bacteria in human tissues using standard stains, and later proved that the organisms were indeed ''Ehrlichia'' using immunoperoxidase stains.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marty AM, Dumler JS, Imes G, Brusman HP, Smrkovski LL, Frisman DM |title=Ehrlichiosis mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Experiments in mouse models further support this hypothesis, as mice lacking TNF-alpha I/II receptors are resistant to liver injury caused by  ''Ehrlichia'' infection.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McBride JW, Walker DH |title=Molecular and cellular pathobiology of Ehrlichia infection: targets for new therapeutics and immunomodulation strategies |journal=Expert Rev Mol Med |volume=13 |pages=e3 |year=2011 |pmid=21276277 |pmc=3767467 |doi=10.1017/S1462399410001730 }}</ref>

About 3% of human monocytic ehrlichiosis cases result in death; however, these deaths occur "most commonly in immunosuppressed individuals who develop [[acute respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], [[hepatitis]], or opportunistic [[nosocomial infection]]s."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Rachael J|author2=Dumler, J Stephen |author3=Carlyon, Jason A |title=Current management of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and ehrlichiosis|journal=Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy|date=1 August 2009|volume=7|issue=6|pages=709–722|doi=10.1586/eri.09.44|pmid=19681699|pmc=2739015}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms in dogs==
Ehrlichiosis in dogs will show obvious symptoms on the later part of infection. This is why some symptoms are already severe when diagnosed. There are three stages of ehrlichia infection - the acute (or the early stage), sub-clinical (symptoms are not yet evident), and clinical or chronic (symptoms are obvious and long-standing). <ref>{{Cite web |title=Ehrlichiosis in Dogs {{!}} VCA Animal Hospitals |url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/ehrlichiosis-in-dogs |access-date=2023-11-03 |website=Vca |language=en}}</ref>

Dogs infected with Ehrlichia often show lameness, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, and loss of appetite during the acute phase, which is one to three weeks after infection. Other symptoms include cough, diarrhea, vomiting, abnormal bruising and/or bleeding, fever, and loss of balance.<ref name="PetMD">{{cite web |title=Ehrlichiosis in Dogs |url=https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_dg_ehrlichiosis |website=Pet MD |access-date=24 January 2023}}</ref>

Dogs with this disease can develop anemia which will show low platelet count which can eventually result to bleeding or blindness. Some doctors also check for arthritis-like symptoms, where the dogs cannot stand on one feet or more because of sore joints. Urinalysis may also be done to the dog to check if the kidneys were infected by the disease. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Ehrlichiosis in Dogs {{!}} VCA Animal Hospitals |url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/ehrlichiosis-in-dogs |access-date=2023-11-03 |website=Vca |language=en}}</ref>

==Prevention==
No human vaccine is available for ehrlichiosis. Tick control is the main preventive measure against the disease. However, in late 2012, a breakthrough in the prevention of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis was announced when a vaccine was accidentally discovered by Prof. Shimon Harrus, Dean of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s Koret School of Veterinary Medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudoler N, Baneth G, Eyal O, van Straten M, Harrus S |title=Evaluation of an attenuated strain of ''Ehrlichia canis'' as a vaccine for canine monocytic ehrlichiosis |journal=Vaccine |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=226–33 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23072894 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.003 }}</ref>

Measures of tick bite prevention include staying out of tall grassy areas that ticks tend to live in, treating clothes and gear that a tick could jump on, using EPA approved bug repellent, tick checks for all humans, animals, and gear that potentially came into contact with a tick, and showering soon after being in an area that ticks might also be in.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2020-07-01|title=Preventing tick bites on people {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref>

Since prevention is the most advanced way of fighting the disease, the veterinarians advise dog owners to get rid of ticks and fleas by using products like Advantix®, Frontline Plus®, Vectra 3D® or Bravecto®. Oral chewable options include Nexgard®, Simparica®, Credelio®, or Bravecto®.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jongejan |first1=Frans |last2=Crafford |first2=Dionne |last3=Erasmus |first3=Heidi |last4=Fourie |first4=Josephus J. |last5=Schunack |first5=Bettina |date=2016-06-17 |title=Comparative efficacy of oral administrated afoxolaner (NexGard™) and fluralaner (Bravecto™) with topically applied permethrin/imidacloprid (Advantix®) against transmission of Ehrlichia canis by infected Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks to dogs |journal=Parasites & Vectors |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=348 |doi=10.1186/s13071-016-1636-9 |issn=1756-3305|doi-access=free |pmid=27317101 |pmc=4912781 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Doxycycline]] and [[minocycline]] are the medications of choice. For people allergic to [[antibiotic]]s of the [[tetracycline]] class, [[rifampin]] is an alternative.<ref name="Goddard"/> Early clinical experience suggested that [[chloramphenicol]] may also be effective, but'' in vitro'' susceptibility testing revealed resistance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Since decline in platelets may also be evident in dogs with this disease, Eupherbia Hirta (Tawa-tawa in Philippines) can also be a supplemental treatment. This plant (or medicines which has this ingredient) helps with the increase of platelets.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sariego |first=Shyne |title=TAWA TAWA LEAVES (Euphorbia hirta) SUPPLEMENTAL TABLET AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR REDUCING HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA |url=https://www.academia.edu/36920180}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Ehrlichiosis is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Cases have been reported in every month of the year, but most cases are reported during April–September.<ref name=":0">Dahlgren FS, Heitman KN, Drexler NA, Massung RF, Behravesh CB.

Since the first case of Ehrlichiosis was reported in 2000, cases reported to the CDC have increased, for example, in 2000, 200 cases were reported and in 2019, 2,093 cases were reported.  Fortunately, the "proportion of ehrlichiosis patients that died as a result of infection" has gone down since 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2021-08-04|title=Ehrlichiosis epidemiology and statistics {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/stats/index.html|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref>

From 2008 to 2012, the average yearly incidence of ehrlichiosis was 3.2 cases per million persons. This is more than twice the estimated incidence for 2000–2007.<ref name=":1" /> The incidence rate increases with age, with the ages of 60–69 years being the highest age-specific years. Children less than 10 years and adults aged 70 years and older have the highest case-fatality rates.<ref name=":1" /> A documented higher risk of death exists among persons who are immunosuppressed.<ref name=":0" />
