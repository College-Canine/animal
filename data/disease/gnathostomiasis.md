==Symptoms and signs==
A few days after ingestion epigastric pain, [[fever]], [[vomiting]], and loss of appetite resulting from migration of larvae through intestinal wall to the [[abdominal cavity]] will appear in the patient.<ref name="John_Petri"/> Migration of parasites in the subcutaneous tissues causing intermittent, migratory, painful, pruritic swellings is known as ''cutaneous larva migrans''. Patches of edema appear after initial symptoms clear and are usually found on the [[abdomen]].<ref name="John_Petri"/> These [[lesions]] vary in size and can be accompanied by [[pruritus]], [[rash]], and stabbing pain. Swellings may last for 1 to 4 weeks in a given area and then reappear in a different location.<ref name="John_Petri"/> Migration to other tissues causes ''visceral larva migrans'' and can result in [[cough]], [[hematuria]], ocular involvement,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=P.

==Causes==
Human gnathostomiasis is infection by the migrating third-stage larvae of any of five species of [[Gnathostoma]].  The most common cause in Asia is ''G. spinigerum'', and the most common cause in the Americas is ''G. binucleatum''. ''G. hispidium'' and ''G. doloresi'' occur in East and Southeast Asia; the former has also been found in Eastern Europe''.'' ''G. nipponicum'' occurs only in Japan and China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/gnathostomiasis/index.html|title=CDC - DPDx - Gnathostomiasis|date=2019-05-07|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref><ref name=Katchanov2011>{{cite journal|vauthors=Katchanov J, Sawanyawisuth K, Chotmongkol V, Nawa Y | title = Neurognathostomiasis, a neglected parasitosis of the central nervous system| journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases| year = 2011| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 1174–1180| url = http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/745014| doi = 10.3201/eid1707.101433| pmid = 21762569| pmc = 3321562}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Herman JS, Chiodini PL | title = Gnathostomiasis, another emerging imported disease| journal = Clin Microbiol Rev| year = 2009| volume = 22| pages = 484–92| doi = 10.1128/CMR.00003-09| pmid = 19597010| issue = 3| pmc = 2708391}}</ref> There is one unconfirmed report of G.

==Transmission==
[[File:Gnathostoma LifeCycle lg.jpg|alt=|thumb|Life-cycle of ''Gnathostoma'']]
Gnathostomiasis is transmitted by the ingestion of [[wikt:raw|raw]] or insufficiently cooked definitive hosts such as fresh water [[fish]], [[poultry]], or [[frog]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In Thailand and Vietnam, the most common cause appears to be consumption of undercooked Asian swamp eels (''[[Monopterus albus]],'' also called ''Fluta alba'') which transmit ''G. spinigerum''.<ref name="Setasuban1991">{{cite journal|author1=Setasuban P |author2=Nuamtanong S |author3=Rojanakittikoon V |author4=Yaemput S |author5=Dekumyoy P |author6=Akahane H |author7=Kojima S | title = Gnathostomiasis in Thailand: a survey on intermediate hosts of Gnathostoma spp. with special reference to a new type of larvae found in ''Fluta alba''| journal = Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health| year = 1991| volume = 22 Suppl| pages = 220–4| pmid = 1822890}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Akahane H, Setasuban P, Nuamtanong S, Horiuchi S, Koga M, Kojima S | title = A new type of advanced third-stage larvae of the genus Gnathostoma in freshwater eels, Fluta alba, from Nakhon Nayok, central Thailand| journal = Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health| year  = 1995| volume = 26| issue = 4| pages = 743–7| pmid = 9139388}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Saksirisampant W, Kulkaew K, Nuchprayoon S, Yentakham S, Wiwanitkit V | s2cid = 24447639| title = A survey of the infective larvae of ''Gnathostoma spinigerum'' in swamp eels bought in a local market in Bangkok, Thailand| journal = Ann Trop Med Parasitol|date=Mar 2002| volume = 96| issue = 2| pages = 191–5| pmid = 12080980| doi = 10.1179/000349802125000295}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sieu TP, Dung TT, Nga NT, Hien TV, Dalsgaard A, Waikagul J, Murrell KD | s2cid = 23748298| title = Prevalence of Gnathostoma spinigerum infection in wild and cultured swamp eels in Vietnam| journal = J Parasitol|date=Feb 2009| volume = 95| issue = 1| pages = 246–8| pmid = 19245276| doi = 10.1645/GE-1586.1}}</ref> ''Monopterus albus'' is an invasive species in North America, but no ''Gnathostoma'' infections in humans have yet been conclusively identified in the US.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Nico LG, Paul Sharp P, Collins TM | title = Imported Asian swamp eels (Synbranchidae: Monopterus) in North American live food markets: potential vectors of non-native parasites| journal = Aquatic Invasions| year = 2011| volume = 6| issue = 1| pages = 69–76 | doi =  10.3391/ai.2011.6.1.08| doi-access = free}}</ref>

==Hosts==

===Intermediate host===
The primary [[intermediate host]] is the minute [[crustacean]]s of the genus ''[[Cyclops (genus)|Cyclops]]''.<ref name="Tolan"/> These crustaceans are then ingested by a second intermediate host, such as frogs.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===Definitive host===
The [[Host (biology)|definitive hosts]] for gnathostomiasis include [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, tigers, [[leopard]]s, [[lion]]s, [[mink]], [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, poultry, frogs, freshwater fish, [[snake]]s or [[bird]]s.<ref name="gideon"/>

==Incubation period==
The [[incubation period]] for gnathostomiasis is 3–4 weeks when the larvae begin to migrate through the subcutaneous tissue of the body.<ref name="Seal">{{cite journal |author1=G. N. Seal |author2=A. K. Gupta |author3=M. K. Das |year=1969 |title=Intra-ocular gnathostomiasis |journal=[[Indian Journal of Ophthalmology]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=109–13 |pmid=5392612 |url=http://www.ijo.in/text.asp?1969/17/3/109/38523}}</ref>

==Morphology==
The adult parasite is reddish-brown in color and has a globular cephalic dome that is separated from the rest of the body by constriction.<ref name="Seal"/> The posterior portion of the nematode is smooth while the [[anterior]] half is covered with fine leaf-like spines.<ref name="Seal"/> The head is round and contains 4 to 8 transverse rows of hooklets that are protected by a pair of fleshy lips . The [[males]] are shorter than the [[females]], {{convert|11|-|25|mm|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|25|-|54|mm|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref name="Seal"/> [[Egg (biology)|Eggs]] are oval and have a mucoid plug at one end.<ref name="Seal"/>

==Life cycle==

===Life cycle in definitive hosts===
Adult worms are found in a tumor located in the gastric wall of the definitive hosts and release eggs into the host's digestive tract. The eggs are then released with [[feces]] and in about a week hatch in water to develop into [[first stage larva]].<ref name="Murrell">{{cite book |author1=K.

Cockman-Thomas |author2=Curtis A. Colleton |author3=Chris H. Gardiner |author4=Wayne M. Meyers |year=1993 |title=Gnathostomiasis in a wild-caught nine-banded armadillo (''Dasypus novemcinctus'') |journal=[[Laboratory Animal Science]] |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=630–2 |pmid=8158995}}</ref> If the [[cyst]] containing flesh of these hosts is ingested by a definitive host, such as dogs, and cats, the cysts are ingested and the larvae escape the cysts and penetrate the gastric wall.<ref name="Murrell"/> These released larvae travel to the [[connective tissue]] and muscle as observed before and after 4 weeks they return to the gastric wall as adults.<ref name="Murrell"/> Here they form a [[tumor]] and continue to mature into adults for the next 6–8 months.<ref name="John_Petri"/> Worms [[mating|mate]] and females begin to excrete [[fertilized]] eggs with feces 8–12 months after ingestion of cysts.<ref name="Tolan"/> They are passed out in the feces and eaten by another fish.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

=== Life cycle in humans ===
Infection of humans by gnathostomiasis is accidental because humans are not one of the definitive hosts of the parasite and do not allow the parasite to complete its life cycle. Infection in humans follows ingestion of raw or insufficiently cooked infected intermediate hosts.<ref name="Tolan"/> The ingested third stage larva migrates from the gastric wall and its migration results in the symptoms associated with infection by gnathostomiasis.<ref name="John_Petri"/> The third stage larvae don't return to the gastric wall preventing it from maturing into adult worms, leaving the life cycle incomplete. Instead the larvae continue to migrate unpredictably unable to develop into adults, so eggs are seldom found in diagnostic tests.<ref name="gideon"/> This also means the number of worms present in humans is a reflection of the number of third stage larvae ingested.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Diagnosis==
[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of gnathostomiasis is possible (with [[microscopy]]) after removal of the worm.
The primary form of diagnosis of gnathostomiasis is the identification of larva in the tissue.<ref name="gideon"/> Serological testing such as [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) or the [[Western blot]] are also reliable but may not be easily accessible in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref name="gideon"/>

[[CT scan]]ning or [[MRI]] can be used to help identify a soft tissue worm and when looking at CNS disease it can be used to reveal the presence of the worm.<ref name="John_Petri"/> The presence of haemorrhagic tracks on gradient-echo T2-weighted MRI is characteristic and possibly diagnostic.<ref name=Katchanov2011/>

==Prevention==
The best strategies for preventing accidental infection of humans is to educate those living in endemic areas to only consume fully cooked meat. The inability of the parasite to complete its life cycle within humans means that transmission can easily be contained by adequate preparation of meat from intermediate hosts. This is especially useful because of the difficulty and lack of feasibility inherent in eliminating all intermediate hosts of gnathostomiasis. So instead, individuals in endemic areas should avoid eating raw and undercooked meat in endemic areas, but this may be difficult in these areas.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

The dish ceviche is native to [[Peru]] and a favorite of Mexico. It consists of [[onion]], cubed fish, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] or [[lemon]] juice and Andean spices including [[salt]] and [[chili pepper|chili]]. The ingredients are mixed together and they are allowed to marinate several hours before being served at room temperature. Then in endemic areas in Southeast Asia there are traditional dishes associated with these areas that also include raw uncooked fish, such as koipla in Thailand, goi ca song in Vietnam, sashimi and sushi in Japan.<ref name="Murrell"/>

Acknowledging these cultural traditions, individuals in these cultural can be educated on methods of adapting their food preparation activities in order to remove the larvae without greatly altering these traditional dishes. For instance, meat should be marinated in [[vinegar]] for six hours or in [[soy sauce]] for 12 hours in order to successfully kill the larvae. In areas with reliable electricity, meat can be frozen at -20 degrees Celsius for 3–5 days to achieve the same results of killing the larvae present.<ref name="Tolan"/>

==Treatment==
[[Surgery|Surgical removal]] or treatment with [[albendazole]] or [[ivermectin]] is recommended.
The most prescribed treatment for gnathostomiasis is surgical removal of the larvae but this is only effective when the worms are located in an accessible location.<ref name="gideon"/> In addition to surgical excision, albendazole and ivermectin have been noted in their ability to eliminate the parasite.<ref name="John_Petri"/> Albendazole is recommended to be administered at 400&nbsp;mg daily for 21 days as an adjunct to surgical excision, while ivermectin is better tolerated as a single dose.<ref name="gideon"/> Ivermectin can also serve as a replacement for those that can't handle albendazole 200&nbsp;ug/kg p.o. as a single dose.<ref name="gideon"/> However, ivermectin has been shown to be less effective than albendazole.<ref name="Thiangtrongjit Nogrado Ketboonlue Malaitong 2021 p.

==Epidemiology==
Endemic areas include [[Asia]], [[Mexico]], [[India]] and parts of [[South Africa]].<ref name="John_Petri"/> Originally believed to be confined to Asia, in the 1970s gnathostomiasis was discovered in Mexico,<ref name="John_Petri"/> and found in Australia in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cameron J Jeremiah |author2=Chanad S Harangozo |author3=Andrew J Fuller |year=2011 |title=Gnathostomiasis in remote northern Western Australia: the first confirmed cases acquired in Australia |journal=[[Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=42–44 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/195_01_040711/jer11082_fm.html|doi=10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb03188.x |pmid=21728942 |s2cid=37139535 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/vic/latest/a/-/newshome/9784278/couple-eaten-alive-by-tiny-worms/ |title=Couple eaten alive by tiny worms |publisher=[[Yahoo]] |date=July 5, 2011 |access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> Even though it is endemic in areas of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Latin America]], it is an uncommon disease. However, researchers have noticed recently an increase in incidence.

==History==
The first case of ''Gnathostoma'' infection was identified by Sir [[Richard Owen]] when inspecting the stomach of a young tiger that had died at [[London Zoo]] from a [[ruptured aorta]].<ref>[http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40000483/ Yangtse Oedema (Gnathostomiasis) Patient UK]</ref> However it was not until 1889 that the first human case was described by Levinson when he found the ''Gnathostoma'' larva in an infested Thai woman. The lifecycle of ''G. spinigerum'' was described by Svasti Daengsvang and [[Chalerm Prommas]] from Thailand in 1933 and 1936.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Valai Bussaratid |author2=Srivicha Krudsood |author3=Udomsak Silachamroon |author4=Sornchai Looareesuwan |year=2005 |title=Tolerability of ivermectin in gnathostomiasis |journal=[[Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=644–9 |pmid=16124431 |url=http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2005_36_3/17-3443.pdf }}</ref> This delay in identification of the parasite in humans is due to the fact that humans are not a definitive host for this [[parasite]] making infection from this parasite rare. Gnathostomiasis infection is rare because the parasite must be digested when it has reached its third larvae stage, providing only a short time frame in which the parasite is capable of infecting humans. It is uncommon for the larvae to penetrate the skin of individuals exposed to contaminated food or water without ingestion.<ref name="Tolan">{{cite web |author=Robert W.
