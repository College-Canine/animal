== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:CongenitalHeartCase-133.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Digital clubbing]] with [[cyanosis|cyanotic]] nail beds in an adult with tetralogy of Fallot]]
Tetralogy of Fallot results in low [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] of blood. This is due to a mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle via the [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) and preferential flow of the mixed blood from both ventricles through the aorta because of the obstruction to flow through the pulmonary valve. The latter is known as a [[right-to-left shunt]].<ref name="Abdulla_2011">{{Cite book | vauthors = Abdulla R |title=Heart diseases in children : a pediatrician's guide|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781441979940|location=New York|pages=169–70|oclc=719361786}}</ref>

Infants with TOF – a cyanotic heart disease – have low blood oxygen saturation.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> Blood oxygenation varies greatly from one patient to another depending on the severity of the anatomic defects.<ref name="Curr2016" /> Typical ranges vary from 60% to around 90%.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> Depending on the degree of obstruction, symptoms vary from no cyanosis or mild cyanosis to profound cyanosis at birth.<ref name="Curr2016" /> If the baby is not cyanotic, then it is sometimes referred to as a "pink tet".<ref name="urlTetralogy of Fallot: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/760387-overview|title=Tetralogy of Fallot: Overview – eMedicine|access-date=2009-01-02|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223044046/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/760387-overview|archive-date=2008-12-23}}</ref> Other symptoms include a [[heart murmur]] which may range from almost imperceptible to very loud, difficulty in feeding, failure to gain weight, retarded growth and physical development, labored breathing (dyspnea) on exertion, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and [[polycythemia]].<ref name="NIH2011Sym" /> The baby may turn blue with breastfeeding or crying.<ref name="NIH2011Sym" />

Those born with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to experience psychiatric disorders such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) in later life, potentially due to underlying genetic changes that predispose to both conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell MW, Chung WK, Kaltman JR, Miller TA | title = Advances in the Understanding of the Genetic Determinants of Congenital Heart Disease and Their Impact on Clinical Outcomes | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29523523 | pmc = 5907537 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.117.006906 }}</ref>

=== Tet spells ===
Infants and children with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot may develop "tet spells".<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> These are acute hypoxia spells, characterized by shortness of breath, cyanosis, agitation, and loss of consciousness.<ref name="Munoz_2010"/>{{rp|200}} This may be initiated by any event – such as anxiety, pain, dehydration, or fever<ref name="Munoz_2010">{{cite book | vauthors = Munoz R, Morell V, Cruz E, Vetterly C |title=Critical care of children with heart disease : basic medical and surgical concepts|date=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=9781848822627|location=London|pages= 18 |oclc=663096154}}</ref> – leading to decreased oxygen saturation or that causes decreased systemic vascular resistance, which in turn leads to increased shunting through the ventricular septal defect.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> Typically, these spells decrease in frequency after the first four years of life.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />

Clinically, tet spells are characterized by a sudden, marked increase in cyanosis followed by [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|200}}

Older children will often [[Squatting position|squat]] instinctively during a tet spell.<ref name="Abdulla_2011" /> This increases [[systemic vascular resistance]] and allows for a temporary reversal of the [[Cardiac shunt|shunt]].

== Cause ==
While the specific causes of TOF have not been fully identified, there are various environmental or genetic factors that have been associated with TOF. So far, around 20% of overall congenital heart defect cases have been due to known causes such as genetic defects and [[teratogens]] which are various factors causing embryo development abnormalities or birth defects.<ref name="Wang_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Li P, Chen S, Xi L, Guo Y, Guo A, Sun K | title = Influence of genes and the environment in familial congenital heart defects | journal = Molecular Medicine Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 695–700 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24337398 | doi = 10.3892/mmr.2013.1847 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, the other 80% of cases have little known about their cause.<ref name="Wang_2014"/>

Genetic factors linked to TOF include various gene mutations or deletions.

[[Embryology]] studies show that [[anterior]] malalignment of the [[aorticopulmonary septum]] results in the clinical combination of a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD), [[Pulmonary Stenosis|pulmonary stenosis]], and an [[overriding aorta]].<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|200}} [[Right ventricular hypertrophy]] develops progressively from resistance to blood flow through the [[Ventricle (heart)|right ventricular]] outflow tract.<ref name="Curr2016" />

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Tetralogy of fallot video.webm|thumb|Video explanation]]
In healthy individuals, the human heart develops around the 20th day of gestation, when the outer endocardial tubes merge into a single cardiac tube. Thereafter, the cardiac tube begins to fold, developing into the atrium and ventricle. The right ventricle is dominant prior to birth, receiving 65% of the venous return to the heart, and is the main contributor of blood flow to the lower part of the body, the placenta, and the lungs. Though the exact cause of TOF is unknown, an association that has been observed is an anterior deviation of the infundibular septum that results in a misaligned VSD, with an overriding aorta causing a subsequent right ventricular obstruction.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />

Different factors such as pulmonary stenosis can also contribute with the right ventricular outflow obstruction. During tet spells, a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary resistance would be physiologically observed.

The main anatomic defect in TOF is the anterior deviation of the pulmonary outflow septum.<ref name="Curr2016" /> This defect results in narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), override of the aorta, and a VSD.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine | vauthors = Jameson JL, Kasper DL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Loscalzo J |isbn=9781259644047|edition=Twentieth |location=New York|oclc=990065894|date=2018-02-06 }}</ref>

=== Four malformations ===
"[[Tetralogy]]" denotes four parts, here implying the syndrome's four anatomic defects.<ref name="NIH2011Sym" /> This is not to be confused with the similarly named [[teratology]], a field of medicine concerned with abnormal development and congenital malformations (including tetralogy of Fallot). Below are the four [[heart]] malformations that present together in tetralogy of Fallot:

! Condition
! Description
|-
| [[Pulmonary stenosis|Pulmonary Infundibular Stenosis]]
| A narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. It can occur at the [[pulmonary valve]] (valvular stenosis) or just below the [[heart|pulmonary valve]] (infundibular stenosis).<ref name="NIH2011What" /> Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by the overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae),<ref name=gatzoulis/> however, the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartelings MM, Gittenberger-de Groot AC | title = Morphogenetic considerations on congenital malformations of the outflow tract.

|-
| [[Overriding aorta]]
| An [[aortic valve]] with biventricular connection, that is, it is situated above the ventricular septal defect and connected to both the right and the left ventricle. The degree to which the aorta is attached to the right ventricle is referred to as its degree of "override." The aortic root can be displaced toward the front (anteriorly) or directly above the septal defect, but it is always abnormally located to the right of the root of the pulmonary artery. The degree of override is extremely variable, with 5-95% of the valve being connected to the right ventricle.<ref name=gatzoulis/>
|-
| [[Ventricular septal defect]] (VSD)
| A hole between the two bottom chambers (ventricles) of the heart. The defect is centered around the most superior aspect of the ventricular septum (the outlet septum), and in the majority of cases is single and large. In some cases, thickening of the septum (septal hypertrophy) can narrow the margins of the defect.<ref name=gatzoulis>Gatzoulis MA, Webb GD, Daubeney PE. (2005) ''Diagnosis and Management of Adult Congenital Heart Disease''. Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia. {{ISBN|0-443-07103-9}}.</ref>
|-
| [[Right ventricular hypertrophy]]
| The [[right ventricle]] is more muscular than normal, causing a characteristic boot-shaped ([[coeur-en-sabot]]) appearance as seen by chest X-ray. Due to the misarrangement of the external ventricular septum, the right ventricular wall increases in size to deal with the increased obstruction to the right outflow tract. This feature is now generally agreed to be a secondary anomaly, as the level of hypertrophy tends to increase with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson RH, Tynan M | title = Tetralogy of Fallot--a centennial review | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–232 | date = December 1988 | pmid = 3068155 | doi = 10.1016/0167-5273(88)90100-3 }}</ref>

[[File:PLC Fallots tetralogy.jpg|thumb|Fallot's tetralogy specimen, from the UCT Pathology Learning Centre]]

There is anatomic variation between the hearts of individuals with tetralogy of Fallot.<ref name="Curr2016" /> Primarily, the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction varies between patients and generally determines clinical symptoms and disease progression.<ref name="Curr2016" />

Presumably, this arises from an unequal growth of the [[aorticopulmonary septum]] (aka pulmonary outflow septum).<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|199}} The aorta is too large, thus "overriding," and this "steals" from the pulmonary artery, which is therefore stenosed. This then prevents ventricular wall closure, therefore VSD, and this increases the pressures on the right side, and so the R ventricle becomes bigger to handle the work.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|199}}

=== Additional anomalies ===

In addition, tetralogy of Fallot may present with other anatomical anomalies, including:<ref name="Francois_2016"/>{{rp|66–8}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hennein HA, Mosca RS, Urcelay G, Crowley DC, Bove EL | title = Intermediate results after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot in neonates | journal = The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 332–42, 344; discussion 342–3 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7531798 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5223(95)70395-0 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:HeartTOP.jpg|thumb|A chest X-ray of a child with tetralogy of Fallot]]
There are three different useful diagnostic tests used for the diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot.<ref name="Bailliard_2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bailliard F, Anderson RH | title = Tetralogy of Fallot | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 4 | pages = 2 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19144126 | pmc = 2651859 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-4-2 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These include a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram.<ref name="Bailliard_2009" /> The echocardiography determines the final diagnosis and typically offers enough information for surgical treatment planning.<ref name="Bailliard_2009" /> About half of all patients are now diagnosed before they are born.<ref name="Bailliard_2009" /> Differential diagnosis is when physicians diagnose between two or more conditions for a person's symptoms and this can include primary pulmonary causes of cyanosis, cyanotic heart lesions, pulmonary stenosis and transposed arterial trunks.<ref name="Bailliard_2009" />

=== Chest radiograph ===
Before more sophisticated techniques became available, chest X-ray was the definitive method of diagnosis. The abnormal "[[coeur-en-sabot]]" (boot-like) appearance of a heart with tetralogy of Fallot is classically visible via chest X-ray, although most infants with tetralogy may not show this finding.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Weerakkody Y |title=Tetralogy of Fallot - Radiology Reference Article - Radiopaedia.org|url=http://radiopaedia.org/articles/tetralogy-of-fallot|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220221208/http://radiopaedia.org/articles/tetralogy-of-fallot|archive-date=2012-02-20|website=radiopaedia.org}}</ref> The boot like shape is due to the right ventricular hypertrophy present in TOF.

=== Electrocardiogram ===
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most basic procedures for assessing the heart.<ref name="Woods_1952">{{cite journal | vauthors = Woods A | title = The electrocardiogram in the tetralogy of Fallot | journal = British Heart Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–203 | date = April 1952 | pmid = 14916062 | pmc = 479443 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.14.2.193 }}</ref> Tiny electrodes are applied to specific areas on the body, near the chest, arm, and neck. Lead cables connect the electrodes to an ECG machine. The heart's electrical activity is then measured.<ref name="Woods_1952" /> Natural electrical impulses help maintain blood flowing properly by coordinating contractions in different areas of the heart.<ref name="Woods_1952" /> These impulses are recorded by an ECG, which shows how fast, the rhythm, intensity and timing of the electrical impulses as they travel through the heart.<ref name="Woods_1952" />

Electrocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), along with right axis deviation.<ref name="Francois_2016" /> RVH is noted on EKG as tall R-waves in lead V1 and deep S-waves in lead V5-V6.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-01|title=Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) • LITFL • ECG Library Diagnosis|url=https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/|access-date=2019-01-21|website=Life in the Fast Lane|language=en-US|archive-date=2019-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122044412/https://litfl.com/right-ventricular-hypertrophy-rvh-ecg-library/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Echocardiogram ===
Congenital heart defects are now diagnosed with [[echocardiography]], which is quick, involves no radiation, is very specific, and can be done prenatally.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Congenital Heart Defects {{!}} National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/congenital-heart-defects#Signs,-Symptoms,-and-Complications|access-date=2019-02-01|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|archive-date=2018-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022221210/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/congenital-heart-defects#Signs,-Symptoms,-and-Complications|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Echocardiography]] establishes the presence of TOF by demonstrating a VSD, RVH, and aortic override. Many patients are diagnosed prenatally. Color Doppler (type of echocardiography) measures the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, close monitoring of the ductus arteriosus is done in the neonatal period to ensure that there is adequate blood flow through the pulmonary valve.<ref name="Francois_2016" /><ref name="Abdulla_20112" />{{rp|171–72}}

In certain cases, coronary artery anatomy cannot be clearly viewed using echocardiogram. In this case, cardiac catheterization can be done.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|37, 201}}

=== Genetics ===
From a genetics perspective, it is important to screen for DiGeorge in all babies with TOF.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|37, 201}}

== Treatment ==

=== Tet spells ===
Tet spells are defined as cyanotic spells occurring due to the obstruction right ventricular outflow.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu IL, Tseng JC | title = Pulmonary embolism in a patient of tetralogy of Fallot: a diagnostic challenge | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 865.e5–865.e6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25619873 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2014.12.061 }}</ref> Tet spells can be triggered by various factors such as crying, [[Tachypnea|progressive tachypnea]], and deep breathing, with symptoms including but not limited to blue skin, nails and lips, profound crying and difficulty breathing.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gawalkar AA|date=December 3, 2021|title=Management of Tet Spell –an updated Review|url=https://www.corpuspublishers.com/assets/articles/article-pdf-253.pdf|journal=Current Research in Emergency Medicine |volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–2 |doi=10.54026/CREM/1002 |s2cid=248489949 |access-date=December 3, 2021|archive-date=December 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211203163442/https://www.corpuspublishers.com/assets/articles/article-pdf-253.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tet spells may be treated with [[beta-blockers]] such as [[propranolol]], but acute episodes require rapid intervention with [[morphine]] or intranasal [[fentanyl]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsze DS, Vitberg YM, Berezow J, Starc TJ, Dayan PS | title = Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot hypoxic spell with intranasal fentanyl | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = e266–e269 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24936003 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2013-3183 | s2cid = 2996572 }}</ref> to reduce ventilatory drive, a vasopressor such as [[phenylephrine]], or [[norepinephrine]] to increase systemic vascular resistance, and IV fluids for volume expansion.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|18, 201}}

Oxygen (100%) may be effective in treating spells because it is a potent pulmonary vasodilator and systemic vasoconstrictor. This allows more blood flow to the lungs by decreasing shunting of deoxygenated blood from the right to left ventricle through the VSD. There are also simple procedures such as [[squatting position|squatting]] and the knee chest position which increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|18, 201}}<ref name="Squatting: the hemodynamic change i"/>

If the spells are refractory to the above treatments, people are usually intubated and sedated. The treatment of last resort for tet spells is [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) along with consideration of Blalock Taussig shunt (BT shunt).<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|18, 201}}

=== Total surgical repair ===
Total surgical repair of TOF is a curative surgery. Different techniques can be used in performing TOF repair. However, a transatrial, transpulmonary artery approach is used for most cases.<ref name = "Mavroudis_2015">{{cite book| vauthors = Mavroudis C, Backer CL, Idriss RF |title=Atlas of pediatric cardiac surgery |isbn=9781447153191|location=London |oclc=926915143 |date=2015-10-24}}</ref>{{rp|153}} The repair consists of two main steps: closure of the VSD with a patch and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract.<ref name="Corno_2009" />

This open-heart surgery is designed to relieve the right ventricular outflow tract stenosis by careful [[Segmental resection|resection]] of muscle and to repair the VSD.<ref name = "Mavroudis_2015" />{{rp|154}}The right ventricle outflow tract can be reconstructed using mainly 2 procedures: a transannular patch (TAP) or a pulmonary valve-sparing procedure (PVS). The decision on the type of the procedure depends on individual anatomy (especially the size of the pulmonary valve). PVS showed better overall survival, event-free survival and less pulmonary regurgitation at 10, 20 and 30 years after the operation.  PVS  can be performed with or without [[Ventriculotomy (cardiac)|ventriculotomy]]. A study found similar overall and event-free survival and pulmonary regurgitation rate between patients who underwent PVS with ventriculotomy and the ones who did not.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ono |first1=Yoshikazu |last2=Hoashi |first2=Takaya |last3=Imai |first3=Kenta |last4=Okuda |first4=Naoki |last5=Komori |first5=Motoki |last6=Kurosaki |first6=Kenichi |last7=Ichikawa |first7=Hajime |date=2022-03-01 |title=Impact of right ventriculotomy for tetralogy of Fallot repair with a pulmonary valve–sparing procedure |url=https://www.jtcvsopen.org/article/S2666-2736(22)00005-5/abstract |journal=JTCVS Open |language=English |volume=9 |pages=191–205 |doi=10.1016/j.xjon.2021.10.061 |pmid=36003424 |pmc=9390402 |issn=2666-2736}}</ref>

Additional reparative or reconstructive surgery may be done on patients as required by their particular cardiac anatomy.<ref name="Mavroudis_2015" />{{rp|153}}

Timing of surgery in asymptomatic patients is usually between the ages of two months to one year.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|201–2}} However, in symptomatic patients showing worsening blood oxygen levels, severe tet-spells (cyanotic spells), or dependence on prostaglandins from early neonatal period (to keep the ductus arteriosus open) need to be planned fairly urgently<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|201–2}}

Potential surgical repair complications include residual ventricular septal defect, residual outflow tract obstruction, complete atrioventricular block, arrhythmias, aneurysm of right ventricular outflow patch, and pulmonary valve insufficiency.<ref name="Corno_2009" />{{rp|59}} Long-term complications most commonly include pulmonary valve regurgitation, and arrhythmias.<ref name="Chessa_2012" />

Total repair of tetralogy of Fallot initially carried a high mortality risk, but this risk has gone down steadily over the years. Surgery is now often carried out in infants one year of age or younger with less than 5% perioperative mortality.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|205}} Post surgery, most patients enjoy an active life free of symptoms.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|205}} Currently, long-term survival is close to 90%.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|167}} Today the adult TOF population continues to grow and is one of the most common congenital heart defects seen in adult outpatient clinics.<ref name="Roos-Hesselink_2017" />{{rp|100–101}}

=== Palliative surgery ===
Initially surgery involved forming a side to end [[surgical anastomosis|anastomosis]] between the [[subclavian artery]] and the [[pulmonary artery]] -i.e. a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt.<ref name="Corno_2009">{{Cite book| vauthors = Corno AF, Festa GP |title=Congenital heart defects : decision making for cardiac surgery.

=== Approaches to surgical repair ===
After years of tetralogy of Fallot surgical repair expertise, the attention shifted to the emerging evidence that long-term pulmonary insufficiency is detrimental to right ventricular function and clinical prognosis.<ref name="Bové_2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bové T | title = Surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot: the quest for the 'ideal' repair | journal = Translational Pediatrics | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–66 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28164034 | pmc = 5253268 | doi = 10.21037/tp.2016.11.02 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Ven JP, van den Bosch E, Bogers AJ, Helbing WA | title = Current outcomes and treatment of tetralogy of Fallot | journal = F1000Research | volume = 8 | pages = F1000 Faculty Rev–1530 | date = 2019-08-29 | pmid = 31508203 | pmc = 6719677 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.17174.1 | doi-access = free }}</ref> As a result, the hunt for surgical procedures to relieve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction while minimizing pulmonary regurgitation has intensified.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" />

A constrained right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with a Dacron patch matched to a nominal pulmonary annulus expansion or an annulus-sparing approach yielded primary complete repair outcomes in 94 TOF infants.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" /> The pulmonary annulus size was larger in babies treated with the latter technique, as predicted.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" /> After an average follow-up of around eight years, the first group had a higher than moderate PR, yet there was no significant difference in independence from severe PR after ten years.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" />

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in right ventricular dilation between the two techniques.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" /> Finally, they found that reconstructing the pulmonary annulus in TOF with only a tiny transannular incision and a stiff Dacron patch to inhibit pulmonary annulus extension throughout the normal growing phase produces the same long-term benefits as preserving the full pulmonary annulus integrity.<ref name="Bové_2017" /><ref name="van_der_Ven_2019" />

== Complications ==

=== Short-term ===
Residual ventricular septal defects and persistent right ventricular outflow blockage are common problems in the immediate postoperative period. Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia can occur after tetralogy repair.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> With broad complex tachycardia, the ECG will likely show a right bundle branch block or left bundle branch block patterns. Patients who have had their hearts repaired may experience sudden cardiac death. Risk factors for abnormal heart rhythms include:

* Age (at repair)<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />
* Male gender<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />
* Transient complete heart block beyond post operative day three<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />
* QRS duration greater than 180 milliseconds<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />

=== Long-term ===
Adult patients with congenital cardiac disease are on the rise at a rate of about 5% per year, outpacing the pediatric population.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> Right ventricular volume overload form pulmonary insufficiency, right ventricular aneurysm from outflow patch or ventriculotomy, distal pulmonary artery obstruction, ventricular hypertrophy, chamber enlargement, biventricular dysfunction, and aortic root dilation and insufficient are all long-term complications seen in these patients.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> Arrhythmia, heart failure, and complications from reoperations are the three primary causes of death in individuals with corrected tetralogy of Fallot. QRS duration greater than 180 milliseconds, older age at repair (greater than three years), significant pulmonary valve or tricuspid valve regurgitation, history of syncope, multifocal premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia are some of the factors associated with sudden death after 30 years of procedure.<ref name="Singab_2021">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Singab H |date=2021-07-15|title=Review of: "Circulation derived from 4D flow MRI correlates with right ventricular dysfunction in patients with tetralogy of Fallot"|journal=Qeios| doi = 10.32388/ab6qgw |s2cid=237843363|doi-access=free}}</ref> Pulmonary insufficiency is the most common reason for reoperation, and pulmonary valve replacement criteria have traditionally been based on the severity of the regurgitant fraction on a magnetic resonance or CT scan. Right and left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices, ejection fractions, and the existence of aneurysm generating obstructive outflow are all parameters seen in this research. Exercise intolerance, heart failure signs and symptoms, syncope, and prolonged ventricular tachycardia are all possible symptoms. A transcatheter pulmonary valve method can also be used to replace a pulmonary valve.<ref name="Singab_2021" />

=== Pregnancy ===
In comparison to the general obstetric population, women who had their tetralogy of Fallot repaired completely have similar outcomes.<ref name="Singh_2021">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Singh Y, Thomson J |date=November 2011 |title=Complications During Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterisation in Children with Tetralogy of Fallot |journal=Pediatric Research|volume=70 |pages=279 |doi=10.1038/pr.2011.504 |s2cid=6071354 |issn=0031-3998|doi-access=free }}</ref> The degree of pulmonary regurgitation with right or left ventricular dysfunction, as well as the level of pulmonary hypertension, are linked to an increased risk of pregnancy complications.<ref name="Singh_2021" /> Fetal death is more likely in women who have moderate right ventricular hypertension or who have undergone a palliative shunt. In comparison to 0.8% of the general population, offspring of women with tetralogy have a 3–5% chance of developing congenital cardiac disease. If the 22q11 deletion is present, there is a 50% chance of transferring the damaged chromosome, with a high risk of a congenital cardiac abnormality.<ref name="Singh_2021" />

== Prognosis ==

Untreated, tetralogy of Fallot rapidly results in progressive right ventricular hypertrophy due to the increased resistance caused by narrowing of the pulmonary trunk.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|199}} This progresses to heart failure which begins in the right ventricle and often leads to left heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. Mortality rate depends on the severity of the tetralogy of Fallot. If left untreated, TOF carries a 35% mortality rate in the first year of life, and a 50% mortality rate in the first three years of life.<ref name="Chessa_2012"/> Patients with untreated TOF rarely progress to adulthood.<ref name="Chessa_2012">{{Cite book | vauthors = Chessa M, Giamberti A |title=The right ventricle in adults with tetralogy of fallot |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9788847023581 |location=Milan |pages=155 |oclc=813213115}}</ref>

Patients who have undergone total surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot have improved hemodynamics and often have good to excellent cardiac function after the operation with some to no exercise intolerance (New York Heart Association Class I-II).<ref name="Cobanoglu_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cobanoglu A, Schultz JM | title = Total correction of tetralogy of Fallot in the first year of life: late results | journal = The Annals of Thoracic Surgery | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–138 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12118745 | doi = 10.1016/s0003-4975(02)03619-6 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Long-term outcome is usually excellent for most patients, however residual post-surgical defects such as pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary artery stenosis, residual VSD, right ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction may affect life expectancy and increase the need for reoperation.<ref name="Munoz_2010" />{{rp|205}}

Within 30 years after correction, 50% of patients will require reoperation.<ref name="Chessa_2012" /> The most common cause of reoperation is a leaky pulmonary valve ([[Pulmonary insufficiency|pulmonary valve insufficiency]]).<ref name="Chessa_2012" /> This is usually corrected with a procedure called [[Valve replacement|pulmonary valve replacement]].<ref name="Francois_2016" />{{rp|136}}

One common prognostic factor with TOF is the development of [[Ischemia-reperfusion injury|ischemia reperfusion injury]]. Insufficient myocardial protection is considered one of the main causes of death in the correction of TOF.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu Q, Wang T, Chen S, Zhou Q, Li H, Hu N, Feng Y, Dong N, Yao S, Xia Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Cardiac protective effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in children undergoing tetralogy of fallot repair surgery: a randomized controlled trial | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | pages = 1028–1037 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28329231 | pmc = 6018784 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehx030 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ji Q, Mei Y, Wang X, Feng J, Wusha D, Cai J, Zhou Y | title = Effect of ischemic postconditioning in correction of tetralogy of Fallot | journal = International Heart Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 312–317 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22008443 | doi = 10.1536/ihj.52.312 | s2cid = 27528923 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Comorbidities ==

There are many [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions that can occur with TOF that may exacerbate the condition. Often, TOF can present with low birth weight and prematurity. In both of these cases, mortality and morbidity were both seen to increase.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Survival and morbidities among very low birth weight infants with chromosomal anomalies |publisher=The University of Iowa| vauthors = Boghossian NS |year=2011 |doi= 10.17077/etd.lm364r03}}</ref> Differences in right atrial and ventricular mechanics and liver stiffness was also observed in adults with repaired TOF, as well as pulmonary atresia and persistent pulmonary stenosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li VW, So EK, Li W, Chow PC, Cheung YF | title = Interplay between right atrial function and liver stiffness in adults with repaired right ventricular outflow obstructive lesions | journal = European Heart Journal: Cardiovascular Imaging | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 1285–1294 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 33367540 | doi = 10.1093/ehjci/jeaa344 }}</ref> In patients with pulmonary atresia, there is complete failure of forward flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arterial vasculature.

Even after operative care, these patients remain at higher risk for pulmonary arterial stenoses and [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Quinlan CA, Latham GJ, Joffe D, Ross FJ | title = Perioperative and Anesthetic Considerations in Tetralogy of Fallot With Pulmonary Atresia | journal = Seminars in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–228 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34380349 | doi = 10.1177/10892532211027395 | s2cid = 236990212 }}</ref>

[[Danon disease]], which is a rare genetic disorder, was also observed to complicate TOF. In particular, elongation of the [[QRS complex]] and a shortened [[PR interval]].

== History ==
Tetralogy of Fallot was initially described in 1671 by the Danish researcher [[Nicolas Steno|Niels Steensen]].<ref name=Name2016/><ref name=VanP2009/> Also referenced as Nicolaus Steno in Latin, Stensen was a pioneer in anatomy and geology, his work making significant specific contribution to the fields of cardiac anatomy and pathology.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> A further description was published in 1888 by the French physician [[Etienne Fallot|Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot]], after whom it was ultimately named.<ref name=Name2016/><ref name=Fallot1888/> In 1924, Maude Elizabeth Seymour Abbott, a pediatric cardiologist from Montreal, Canada, named it tetralogy of Fallot.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Abbott ME, Dawson WT |date=1924|title=The clinical classification of congenital cardiac disease, with remarks upon its pathological anatomy, diagnosis and treatment|journal=Int Clin.|volume=4|pages=156–88}}</ref>

The short paper "Dissection of a Monstrous Foetus in Paris" in 1671 first described the conditions that would later together be known as TOF. In particular, it highlighted the unusual formation of arteries, the stenosing of the pulmonary artery, the absence of the ductus arteriosus, an overriding aorta, and fetal cardiac circulation where blood was redirected to the aorta from the pulmonary artery.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> Over a hundred years later in 1777, Dutch physician [[Eduard Sandifort]] reported what he referred to as "the blue boy" patient. This patient, who was 16 months old, was initially thought to have [[asthma]], though an autopsy postmortem revealed a cardiac malformation with no ductus arteriosus or ligamentum arteriosum, indicating that the child may have died from TOF.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> Another 13-year-old patient was reported by Scottish physician [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] in 1782. Hunter described the patient, along with three others, as suffering from cyanosis after a posthumous examination in 1774.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />

Other cases, such as those presented by Pulteney (1785), Abernethy (1793), Bell (1797), Dorsey (1812), and Farre (1814) also contributed to modern understandings of TOF. The first reported case of TOF was in America at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1816, with more cases being reported by Peacock (1858 and 1869), Widman (1881), and finally Fallot (1888), after whom the condition is named.<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" /> Fallot was the first to elegantly describe the four key features that differentiate it from other cyanotic cardiac conditions, and was prominent in the disqualification of a [[patent foramen ovale]] as a fifth feature. Fallot initially referred to it as "La maladie bleue", which is French for "the blue disease" or "cyanose cardiaque", translating to "cardiac cyanosis".<ref name="Diaz-Frias_2021" />

The first surgical repair was carried out in 1944 at Johns Hopkins.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun B |title=Vivien Thomas helped develop the 'blue baby' operation at Johns Hopkins |website=Baltimoresun.com |date=8 February 2007 |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-blackhistory-thomas-story.html |access-date=17 February 2019 |archive-date=14 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214233441/https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-blackhistory-thomas-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The procedure was conducted by surgeon [[Alfred Blalock]] and cardiologist [[Helen B.
