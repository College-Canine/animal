'''Perineal hernia''' is a [[hernia]] involving the [[perineum]] ([[pelvic floor]]).  The hernia may contain fluid, [[fat]], any part of the [[intestine]], the [[rectum]], or the [[urinary bladder|bladder]]. It is known to occur in [[human]]s, [[dog]]s, and other mammals, and often appears as a sudden swelling to one side (sometimes both sides) of the [[anus]].

A common cause of perineal hernia is surgery involving the perineum.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2023}} Perineal hernia can be caused also by excessive straining to defecate.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2023}} [[Atrophy]] of the [[levator ani muscle]] and disease of the [[pudendal nerve]] may also contribute to a perineal hernia.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2023}}

==In humans==
In humans, a major cause of perineal hernia is perineal surgery without adequate reconstruction.  In some cases, particularly surgeries to remove the coccyx and distal sacrum, adequate reconstruction is very difficult to achieve.  The posterior perineum is a preferred point of access for surgery in the [[pelvic cavity]], particularly in the [[presacral space]].  Surgeries here include repair of [[rectal prolapse]] and anterior [[meningocele]], [[radical perineal prostatectomy]], removal of [[tumor]]s including [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]], and [[coccygectomy]].  Perineal hernia is a common complication of coccygectomy in adults,<ref name="pmid9207665">{{cite journal

Several surgeries have been described for perineal hernias in dogs.  The current standard involves transposition of the [[Obturator internus muscle|internal obturator muscle]].  This technique has a lower recurrence and complication rate than traditional hernia repair.  A new technique uses [[pig|porcine]] [[small intestine|small intestinal]] [[submucosa]] as a [[biomaterial]] to help repair the defect.  This is can also be done in combination with internal obturator muscle transposition, especially when that muscle is weak.<ref name=Ettinger>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=6th|publisher=W.B.
