==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Blausen 0082 BladderCancer.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Location of bladder cancer]]
Bladder cancer characteristically causes [[blood in the urine]], which may be visible or detectable only by microscope. Blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer, and is painless. Visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration, and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood. Between 80 and 90% of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Avellino GJ, Bose S, Wang DS | title = Diagnosis and Management of Hematuria | journal = The Surgical Clinics of North America | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 503–15 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27261791 | doi = 10.1016/j.suc.2016.02.007 | s2cid = 41691491 }}</ref> Blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers or vascular malformations, though these conditions (except [[kidney cancer]]s) would typically be painful.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Other possible symptoms include [[Dysuria|pain during urination]], [[frequent urination]], or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, including [[prostate]] infections, [[overactive bladder]] or [[cystitis]]. Some rare forms of bladder cancer like [[Urachal cancer|urachal adenocarcinoma]] produce [[mucin]], which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick.<ref name="Klaile 2016 692–701">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klaile Y, Schlack K, Boegemann M, Steinestel J, Schrader AJ, Krabbe LM | title = Variant histology in bladder cancer: how it should change the management in non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive disease? | journal = Translational Andrology and Urology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 692–701 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27785426 | pmc = 5071184 | doi = 10.21037/tau.2016.06.13 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Causes==

===Smoking===

[[Tobacco]] [[smoking]] is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer; in most populations, smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeegers MP, Tan FE, Dorant E, van Den Brandt PA | title = The impact of characteristics of cigarette smoking on urinary tract cancer risk: a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies | journal = Cancer | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 630–9 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10931463 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(20000801)89:3<630::AID-CNCR19>3.0.CO;2-Q | url = https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/the-impact-of-characteristics-of-cigarette-smoking-on-urinary-tract-cancer-risk-a-metaanalysis-of-epidemiologic-studies(01f8bed8-20fb-4f9d-8980-73eb7e24ccc2).html | doi-access = free }}</ref> however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in Europe and North America.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Osch FH, Jochems SH, van Schooten FJ, Bryan RT, Zeegers MP | title = Quantified relations between exposure to tobacco smoking and bladder cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 89 observational studies | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 857–70 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27097748 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyw044 | doi-access = free }}</ref> There is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration (in years), [[Pack-year|pack years]] and bladder cancer risk. A risk plateau at smoking about 15 cigarettes a day can be observed (meaning that those who smoke 15 cigarettes a day are approximately at the same risk as those smoking 30 cigarettes a day). Smoking in any form (cigar, cigarette, pipe, Egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco) increases the risk for bladder cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Letašiová S, Medve'ová A, Šovčíková A, Dušinská M, Volkovová K, Mosoiu C, Bartonová A | title = Bladder cancer, a review of the environmental risk factors | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 11 | pages = S11 | date = June 2012 | issue = Suppl 1 | pmid = 22759493 | pmc = 3388449 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-11-S1-S11 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2012EnvHe..11S..11L }}</ref> Quitting smoking reduces the risk.

===Occupational exposure===

Thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens. Occupational or circumstantial exposure to the following substances has been implicated as a cause of bladder cancer; [[benzidine]] (dyes manufacturing), [[4-Aminobiphenyl|4-aminobiphenyl]] (rubber industry), [[2-Naphthylamine|2-naphtylamine]] (azo dyes manufacturing, foundry fumes, rubber industry, cigarette smoke and cancer research), [[phenacetin]] (analgesic), [[arsenic]] and chlorinated [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbons]] in drinking water, [[Auramine O|auramine]] (dye manufacturing), magenta (dye manufacturing), [[ortho-toluidine]] (dye manufacturing), [[epoxy]] and [[polyurethane]] resin hardening agents (plastics industry), [[chlornaphazine]], [[Coal tar|coal-tar pitch]].<ref>{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risk to Humans |title=4-AMINOBIPHENYL |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK304408/ |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |language=en |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saint-Jacques N, Parker L, Brown P, Dummer TJ | title = Arsenic in drinking water and urinary tract cancers: a systematic review of 30 years of epidemiological evidence | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 13 | pages = 44 | date = June 2014 | issue = 1 | pmid = 24889821 | pmc = 4088919 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-13-44 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2014EnvHe..13...44S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clin B, Pairon JC | title = Medical follow-up for workers exposed to bladder carcinogens: the French evidence-based and pragmatic statement | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 14 | pages = 1155 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25377503 | pmc = 4230399 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1155 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risk to Humans |title=CHLORNAPHAZINE |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK304335/ |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |language=en |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK304406/|title=2-NAPHTHYLAMINE|last=Humans|first=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risk to|date=2012|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|language=en}}</ref> Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, painters, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, machine setters, and mechanics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reulen RC, Kellen E, Buntinx F, Brinkman M, Zeegers MP | title = A meta-analysis on the association between bladder cancer and occupation | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology.

Currently, the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of [[cystoscopy]], which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube (called a ''cystoscope'') bearing a camera and various instruments is inserted into the bladder through the [[urethra]]. The flexible procedure allows for a visual inspection of the bladder, for minor remedial work to be undertaken and for samples of suspicious lesions to be taken for a [[biopsy]]. A rigid [[Cystoscopy|cystoscope]] is used under general anesthesia in the operating room and can support remedial work and biopsies as well as more extensive tumor removal. Unlike papillary lesion, which grow into the bladder cavity and are readily visible, [[carcinoma in situ]] lesion are flat and obscure. Detection of carcinoma in situ lesions requires multiple biopsies from different areas of interior bladder wall.<ref name= eau_nmibc>{{cite web |title=EAU Guidelines: Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Diagnosis |url=https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/#note_109 |website=Uroweb |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref> Photodynamic detection (blue light cystoscopy) can aid in the detection of carcinoma in situ. In photodynamic detection, a dye is instilled into the bladder with the help of a catheter. Cancer cells take up this dye and are visible under blue light, providing visual clues on areas to be biopsied or resected.<ref name = eau_mibc>{{cite web |title=EAU Guidelines: Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer diagnosis |url=https://uroweb.org/guideline/bladder-cancer-muscle-invasive-and-metastatic/#5 |website=Uroweb |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>

However, visual detection in any form listed above, is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification, cell type or the stage of the present tumor. A so-called cold cup [[biopsy]] during an ordinary cystoscopy (rigid or flexible) will not be sufficient for pathological staging either. Hence, a visual detection needs to be followed by transurethral surgery. The procedure is called [[transurethral resection of bladder tumor]] (TURBT). Further, a rectal and vaginal bimanual examination should be carried out before and after the TURBT to assess whether there is a palpable mass or if the tumour is fixed ("tethered") to the pelvic wall. The pathological classification and staging information obtained by the TURBT-procedure, is of fundamental importance for making the appropriate choice of ensuing treatment and/or follow-up routines.<ref name="uroweb.org">{{cite web|title=Uroweb - European Association of Urology (EAU)|url=https://uroweb.org/|website=Uroweb|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>

If invasive or high grade (includes [[carcinoma in situ]]) cancer is detected on TURBT, an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] and/or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and [[CT scan|CT chest]] should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread ([[metastasis]]).<ref name="journals.lww.com">{{cite journal |last1=Awiwi |first1=MO |last2=Vikram |first2=R |title=Radiologic Diagnosis and Staging of Bladder Cancer: An Update. |journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography |date=18 June 2022 |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=530–544 |doi=10.1097/RCT.0000000000001322 |pmid=35723651 |s2cid=249869037 |url=https://journals.lww.com/jcat/Fulltext/9900/Radiologic_Diagnosis_and_Staging_of_Bladder.56.aspx |access-date=23 June 2022}}</ref> Increase in [[alkaline phosphatase]] levels without evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for [[bone metastasis]] by a [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scan]].<ref name="NCI2017Pt">{{cite web|date=8 May 2020|title=Bladder Cancer Treatment|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/patient/bladder-treatment-pdq#section/all|access-date=2020-06-04|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en}}</ref> Although <sup>18</sup>[[Positron emission tomography|F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)]]/CT has been explored as a viable method for staging, there is no consensus to support its role in routine clinical evaluations.<ref name="eau_mibc" />

[[Urine cytology]] can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy ("bladder washing").

Bladder cancer is staged (classified by the extent of spread of the cancer) and graded (how abnormal and aggressive the cells appear under the microscope) to determine treatment and predict outcomes. Staging is usually performed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and radiologic imaging (CT and MRI). Papillary tumors confined to the mucosa or which invade the [[lamina propria]] are classified as Ta or T1. Flat lesions that do not invade the basement membrane of the bladder mucosa are termed Tis (in situ). All three categories (Tis, Ta and T1) are grouped together as non-muscle invasive disease for therapeutic purposes and in most cases they are offered cystoscopic resection with TURBT without the need for radical resection of the entire urinary bladder. Tumors in the remaining categories (T2, T3 and T4) are termed muscle-invasive disease and are associated with less favorable prognosis.<ref name="journals.lww.com"/>

The EORTC and CUETO model use a cumulative score obtained from individual prognostic factors, which are then converted into risk of progression and recurrence. The six prognostic factors included in the EORTC model are number of tumors, recurrence rate, T-stage, presence of carcinoma-in-situ and grade of the tumor. Scoring for recurrence in the CUETO model incorporates 6 variables; age, gender, grade, tumor status, number of tumors and presence of tis. For progression scoring the previous 6 variables plus T stage is used.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sylvester RJ, van der Meijden AP, Oosterlinck W, Witjes JA, Bouffioux C, Denis L, Newling DW, Kurth K | display-authors = 6 | title = Predicting recurrence and progression in individual patients with stage Ta T1 bladder cancer using EORTC risk tables: a combined analysis of 2596 patients from seven EORTC trials | journal = European Urology | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 466–5; discussion 475–7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16442208 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2005.12.031 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernandez-Gomez J, Madero R, Solsona E, Unda M, Martinez-Piñeiro L, Gonzalez M, Portillo J, Ojea A, Pertusa C, Rodriguez-Molina J, Camacho JE, Rabadan M, Astobieta A, Montesinos M, Isorna S, Muntañola P, Gimeno A, Blas M, Martinez-Piñeiro JA | display-authors = 6 | title = Predicting nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer recurrence and progression in patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin: the CUETO scoring model | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 182 | issue = 5 | pages = 2195–203 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19758621 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2009.07.016 }}</ref>

===Non-muscle invasive===

====Transurethral resection====

Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (those not entering the muscle layer of the bladder) can be "shaved off" using an [[electrocautery]] device attached to a [[cystoscope]], which in that case is called a resectoscope. The procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and serves primarily for pathological staging. In case of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer the TURBT is in itself the treatment, but in case of muscle invasive cancer, the procedure is insufficient for final treatment.<ref name="uroweb.org"/> Additionally, blue light [[cystoscopy]] with optical-imaging agent Hexaminolevulinate (HAL) is recommended at initial TURBT to increase lesion detection (especially carcinoma in situ) and improve resection quality thereby reducing recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witjes JA, Babjuk M, Gontero P, Jacqmin D, Karl A, Kruck S, Mariappan P, Palou Redorta J, Stenzl A, van Velthoven R, Zaak D | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical and cost effectiveness of hexaminolevulinate-guided blue-light cystoscopy: evidence review and updated expert recommendations | journal = European Urology | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 863–71 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25001887 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2014.06.037 | url = https://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/187392/1/Elsevier_171019.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daneshmand S, Schuckman AK, Bochner BH, Cookson MS, Downs TM, Gomella LG, Grossman HB, Kamat AM, Konety BR, Lee CT, Pohar KS, Pruthi RS, Resnick MJ, Smith ND, Witjes JA, Schoenberg MP, Steinberg GD | display-authors = 6 | title = Hexaminolevulinate blue-light cystoscopy in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: review of the clinical evidence and consensus statement on appropriate use in the USA | journal = Nature Reviews.

Moreover, nearly half of the people with high-grade noninvasive disease have residual tumor after primary TURBT; in such cases a second TURBT is important for avoiding under-staging.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Miladi M, Peyromaure M, Zerbib M, Saïghi D, Debré B | title = The value of a second transurethral resection in evaluating patients with bladder tumours | journal = European Urology | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–5 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12600426 | doi = 10.1016/s0302-2838(03)00040-x | s2cid = 5784606 }}</ref><ref name = uroweb_treatment >{{cite web |title=EAU Guidelines: Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer |url=https://uroweb.org/guideline/non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/#7 |website=Uroweb}}</ref> At this point classifying people into risk groups is recommended. Treatment and surveillance for different risk groups is indicated in the table below.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Another method for reducing recurrence of tumors is medication after TURBT surgery.

====BCG treatment failure====
BCG treatment failure can be classified into 3 groups; BCG relapse, BCG-refractory and BCG-intolerant. In BCG relapse, tumor reoccurs after a disease free period. BCG-refractory tumors are the ones which do not respond to induction and maintenance doses of BCG or which progress during therapy. In BCG-intolerant, tumor reoccurs due to incomplete treatment as the person receiving it is unable to tolerate an induction course of BCG. Around 50% of the people fail BCG treatment and would require further treatment.<ref name = nature_25800393/>

People whose tumors recurred after treatment with BCG or who were unresponsive to treatment, are more difficult to treat.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witjes JA | title = Management of BCG failures in superficial bladder cancer: a review | journal = European Urology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 790–7 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16464532 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2006.01.017 | s2cid = 5103506 }}</ref> In such people a [[cystectomy|radical cystectomy]] is recommendation<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Babjuk W, Oosterlinck W, Sylvester R |year=2010 |title=Guidelines on TaT1 (Non-muscle invasive) Bladder Cancer |url=http://www.uroweb.org/?id=218&gid=1 |publisher=[[European Association of Urology]] |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424015200/http://www.uroweb.org/?id=218&gid=1 |archive-date=24 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bladder Cancer Clinical Guideline Update Panel |year=2007 |title=Bladder Cancer: Guideline for the Management of Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: (Stages Ta, T1, and Tis): 2007 Update |publisher=[[American Urological Association]]}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> In people who do not show response to BCG therapy and are unfit or unwilling to undergo [[Cystectomy|radical cystectomy]], salvage therapies can be considered.

====Photodynamic Therapy====

[[Photodynamic therapy|Photodynamic therapy (PDT)]] is a treatment option involving the administration of a [[Photosensitizer|photosensitizing agent]], followed by the exposure of the bladder’s inner lining to a specific wavelength of light through a cystoscope. The light activation of the photosensitizer helps to destroy cancerous cells while sparing much of the surrounding healthy tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=C |title=A clinical evaluation of the optical characteristics of the prostate in men with prostate cancer |journal=European Urology |volume=5 |issue=Suppl |page=131 |year=2006 |url=https://www.eu-urology.com/article/S0302-2838(06)00589-1/fulltext |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Photodynamic therapy for bladder cancer—a review of current status and future promise |journal=Nature Reviews Urology |last=Fleshker |first=S. |year=2008 |volume=84 |pages=1231–1237 |doi=10.1038/nrurol.2008.123 |doi-broken-date=29 April 2024 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrurol.2008.123 |access-date=}}</ref>

PDT is particularly advantageous for patients who might be at high risk from surgery or those who prefer a less invasive option. The procedure is known for its precision and the ability to be repeated, which is important for managing the recurrent nature of NMIBC. Clinical trials and studies have shown that PDT can be effective in reducing tumor recurrence rates and is associated with a favorable safety profile, emphasizing its potential as a primary or adjuvant treatment modality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Limami |first1=Youness |title=Shining a Light on Prostate Cancer: Photodynamic Therapy and Combination Approaches |journal=Pharmaceutics |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=1767 |year=2023 |doi=10.3390/pharmaceutics15061767 |doi-access=free |pmid=37376215 }}</ref>

Research continues to evaluate the long-term outcomes of PDT for bladder cancer and explore potential improvements in photosensitizers and light delivery systems to enhance the treatment’s efficacy and patient outcomes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Advances in Management of Bladder Cancer—The Role of Photodynamic Therapy |url=https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics/special_issues/Bladder_Cancer |website=MDPI Pharmaceutics |access-date=}}</ref>

===Muscle invasive===

[[File:Diagram showing bladder reconstruction CRUK 111.svg|thumb|Surgical reconstruction (neobladder) of the bladder following removal.]]

====Multimodal therapy (standard treatment)====
{{Further|Cystectomy}}
Untreated, non-muscle invasive tumors may gradually begin to infiltrate the muscular wall of the bladder (muscle invasive bladder cancer). Tumors that infiltrate the bladder wall require more radical surgery, where part ([[partial cystectomy]]) or all ([[Cystectomy|radical cystectomy]]) of the bladder is removed (a cystectomy) and the urinary stream is diverted into an isolated bowel loop (called an ileal conduit or [[urostomy]]). In some cases, skilled surgeons can create a substitute bladder (a [[neobladder]]) from a segment of intestinal tissue, but this largely depends upon a person's preference, age of the person, [[renal function]], and the site of the disease.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

A bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy should accompany radical cystectomy. At minimum, a standard template of [[lymphadenectomy]] should be followed by removing the [[External iliac lymph nodes|external]] and [[Internal iliac lymph nodes|internal iliac]] and [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Lymph-drainage-of-the-cervix-uteri-is-complex-bilateral-and-can-affect-lymph-nodes-in_fig1_46221277 obturator lymph node].<ref name="aua_mibc" /> When performing a lymphadenectomy, the surgeon can either remove lymph nodes from a smaller (standard) or from larger (extended) area. In comparison with a standard lymph node dissection, having an extended dissection may reduce a person's likelihood of death from any reason, including dying from bladder cancer.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Eu Chang|last2=Sathianathen|first2=Niranjan J|last3=Imamura|first3=Mari|last4=Kuntz|first4=Gretchen M|last5=Risk|first5=Michael C|last6=Dahm|first6=Philipp|date=2019-05-14|editor-last=Cochrane Urology Group|title=Extended versus standard lymph node dissection for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder in patients undergoing radical cystectomy|url= |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2019|issue=5 |pages=CD013336|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD013336|pmc=6528183|pmid=31111956}}</ref> The extended procedure may lead to more serious unwanted effects and may or may not influence the likelihood of the cancer recurring over time.<ref name=":12" /> The rate of not-so-serious side effects may be similar for both surgeries.<ref name=":12" />

Survival after [[Cystectomy|radical cystectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection is dependent on the pathological stage. If the disease has not spread to the [[lymph node]] and is limited to the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] (T1 or T2, N0) the 5-year survival is 78%. If it has spread locally around the region of the bladder with no [[lymph node]] involved (T3, N0) then the 5-year survival drops to 47%. In disease with lymph node spread (N+, irrespective of T stage) the 5-year survival is 31%. Locally advanced and metastatic disease drastically decreases survival, with a median survival of 3–6 months without chemotherapy. [[Cisplatin]]-based chemotherapy has increased the median survival to 15-months. However, the 5-year survival is still 15%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyson MD, Chang SS, Keegan KA | title = Role of consolidative surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced or regionally metastatic bladder cancer | journal = Bladder | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | date = 2016 | pages = e26 | pmid = 28261632 | pmc = 5336315 | doi = 10.14440/bladder.2016.89 | doi-broken-date = 29 April 2024 }}</ref>
