The '''Havanese''', a [[bichon]]-type dog, is the national dog of [[Cuba]], developed from the now extinct ''Blanquito de la Habana'' ("little white dog of [[Havana]]").<ref>{{Cite news |last=Portuondo |first=Zoila |date=26 Aug 2023 |title=Bichón habanero, el carismático faldero nacido en Cuba |url=https://oncubanews.com/cuba/sociedad-cuba/bichon-habanero-el-carismatico-faldero-nacido-en-cuba/ |access-date=28 Feb 2024 |work=OnCubaNews}}</ref> The ''Blanquito'' descended from the also now-extinct Bichón Tenerife. It is believed that the ''Blanquito'' was eventually [[cross-bred]] with other [[bichon]] types, including the [[poodle]], to create what is now known as the Havanese. They are sometimes referred to as "Havana Silk Dogs", but this is a separate breed, which has been bred to meet the original Cuban standards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}} 

==Characteristics==

[[File:Havanese0315.jpg|thumb|200px|Havanese in the "Puppy Cut" which is favored by some non-show dog owners]]

===Appearance===
The Havanese is a [[toy dog]] with a silky coat. The height of the Havanese ranges from {{cvt|8+1/2|to|11+1/2|in|cm}} at the withers with {{cvt|9|to|10+1/2|in|cm}} being the ideal height. The body, measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall.<ref name="AKC">{{cite web |title=Havanese Standard |url=https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Havanese.pdf |website=American Kennel Club |access-date=24 February 2024}}</ref>

A unique aspect of the breed is the topline, which rises just slightly from withers to the croup, creating a topline that is straight but not level. Renowned for their flashy, lively gait, their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far-reaching one. The angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait.<ref name="AKC"/>

The muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose. It does not have the appearance of being short or snipy. Length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle. The top of the skull is rather flat and the back skull is rounded.<ref name="AKC"/>

The length from [[foot]] to [[elbow]] is equal to the length from elbow to withers. The fore chest is pronounced. When in a standing position, the sternum lines up with the elbows, creating a deep chest. Ribs are well-sprung and the abdomen is moderately tucked up.<ref name="AKC" />

The Havanese has solid black eyes — except for the chocolate colored dogs which may have brown eyes — and almond-shaped lids surrounded by black pigment. The ears, when extended, reach half way to the nose. They arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face. The tail is carried arched forward up over the back. While the tail's long plume of hair falls on the body, the tail itself never touches the back.<ref name="AKC"/>

====Coat and color====
Havanese have a long and furnished double [[Double coat|coat]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bellamy |first1=Kim K.

Unlike other double-coated breeds, the Havanese outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense, but rather soft and light.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The undercoat is sometimes completely absent.{{cn|date=February 2024}}  The Havanese coat should be very soft, almost cool to the touch, like silk.<ref name="AKC"/>

The coat is shown naturally brushed out or [[cording (dog grooming)|corded]],<ref name="AKC"/> a technique which turns the long coat into cords of hair, similar to dreadlocks in humans.{{cn|date=February 2024}} 

Although there are a few arguments on whether the original Havanese were all white or of different colors{{cn|date=February 2024}} , modern Havanese are acceptable in all coat colors and patterns.<ref name="AKC"/> All colored dogs should have a black nose and black pigment around the eyes, with the exception of chocolate (brown) dogs, which may have dark brown pigment on their nose instead.<ref name="AKC" />

==Health==
Havanese suffer primarily from [[luxating patella]], liver disease, heart disease, [[cataracts]] and [[retinal dysplasia]].<ref name="upei">{{cite web|url=http://www.upei.ca/cidd/breeds/havanese2.htm |title=Havanese |access-date=21 May 2009 |date=2 January 2004 |work=Canine Inherited Disorders Database }}</ref>

The Havanese is predisposed to [[sebaceous adenitis]].<ref>{{cite book | last1=Hnilica | first1=Keith A. | last2=Patterson | first2=Adam P. | title=Small Animal Dermatology | publisher=Saunders | publication-place=St. Louis (Miss.) | date=2016-09-19 | isbn=978-0-323-37651-8 | page=}}</ref>

A study of over 90,000 dogs attending the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital found the Havanese to be predisposed to [[portosystemic shunt]]: 4.35% of Havanese had the condition compared to 0.35% for [[Mongrel|mixed-breed dogs]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bellumori | first1=Thomas P. | last2=Famula | first2=Thomas R. | last3=Bannasch | first3=Danika L. | last4=Belanger | first4=Janelle M. | last5=Oberbauer | first5=Anita M. | title=Prevalence of inherited disorders among mixed-breed and purebred dogs: 27,254 cases (1995–2010) | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) | volume=242 | issue=11 | date=2013-06-01 | issn=0003-1488 | doi=10.2460/javma.242.11.1549 | pages=1549–1555| pmid=23683021 }}</ref>

==History==
The Havanese is a member of the [[bichon]] family of dogs. The progenitors of the breed are believed to have come from [[Tenerife]].<ref name=AKCgettoknow /> Ship manifests from Tenerife bound for Cuba list dogs as passengers brought aboard, and these dogs were most probably the dog of Tenerife. Some believe the entire bichon family of dogs can be traced back to the Tenerife dog, while others theorize that the origins are in Malta, citing the writings of Aristotle, and other historical evidence of the early presence of such dogs in [[Malta]]. Whatever the actual origins of bichon dogs, these little dogs soon became devoted companions to the Spanish colonists in Cuba and were highly admired by the nobility.<ref name=AKCgettoknow /><ref name="AKC Havanese">{{cite web |title=Havanese |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/havanese/ |website=American Kennel Club |access-date=24 February 2024}}</ref>

As part of the [[Cuban Revolution]], upper-class Cubans and others marked out for annihilation by the communists fled to the [[United States]], but few were able to bring their dogs. When American breeders became interested in this [[Rare breed (dog)|rare]] and charming dog in the 1970s, the US gene pool was only 11 dogs.<ref>{{cite book| section=Chapter 1: History of the Havanese: In Cuba and Beyond|title= The Havanese| first1=Diane |last1=Klumb| first2= Joanne |last2= Baldwin |publisher= BookSurge Publishing| date= 10 July 2006| isbn= 978-1-4196-4280-7}}</ref> The American Kennel Club (AKC) only officially recognized the Havanese breed in 1996.<ref name=AKCgettoknow />

With dedicated breeding, and the acquisition of some new dogs internationally, the Havanese has made a huge comeback and is one of the fastest growing breeds of dogs in the AKC.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The 2013 [[AKC National Championship|AKC]] statistics rank the Havanese as the 25th most popular [[Purebred dog|pure-breed]] in the United States, a rise in popularity from 28th place in 2012.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ American Kennel Club 2013 Dog Registration Statistics Historical Comparisons & Notable Trends], ''The American Kennel Club'', Retrieved 14 May 2014</ref>

==Activities==
Because of the Havanese's friendly and readily trained nature, it is used for a variety of jobs involving the public, including [[therapy dog]]s, [[assistance dog]]s, such as [[hearing dog|signal dogs]] for the hearing impaired, performing dogs, [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[termite]] detection, and [[tracking (dog)|tracking]].{{cn|date=February 2024}}

Havanese also compete in a variety of [[dog sports]], such as [[dog agility]], [[flyball]], [[musical canine freestyle]], and [[obedience training]].{{cn|date=February 2024}}


==As show dogs==

The breed standard notes that except for slight trimming around the feet to allow for a tidy foot, they are to be shown untrimmed;<ref name=AKCgettoknow /> any further trimming, back-combing, or other fussing is against type and will not be allowed to the point of precluding placement in dog shows. The breed standard specifies that the tail may not be docked. The [[American Kennel Club]] Standard allows head furnishings above each eye to be held in two small braids secured with plain elastic bands.<ref name="AKC"/>
