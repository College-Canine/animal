The '''English Springer''' is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[gun dog]] in the [[Spaniel]] group traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. They are descended from the [[Norfolk Spaniel|Norfolk]] or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. It is closely related to the [[Welsh Springer Spaniel]] and very closely to the [[English Cocker Spaniel]]; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller "cockers" were used in [[woodcock]] hunting while their larger littermates were used to flush, or "spring", other game birds. In 1902, [[The Kennel Club]] recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_springer_spaniel/index.cfm|title=English Springer Spaniel Dog Breed Information|website=Akc.org|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref> They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term ''Springer'' comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would [[Flushing dog|flush]] (spring) [[birds]] into the air.

== Description ==
[[File:English Springer Spaniel liver & white.jpg|thumb|A liver & white bitch]]
The English Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds but are registered together. The gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years.<ref name="diff">{{cite web | url=http://www.essft.com/fieldshow.html#FIELD | work=English Springer Spaniel Information and Field Trial Page | title=Know The Difference Between A Show Bred & Field Bred English Springer Spaniel | access-date=9 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630213919/http://www.essft.com/fieldshow.html#FIELD | archive-date=30 June 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.<ref name="spring.org"/>

The English Springer Spaniel field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog may be docked a few inches in comparison to the show dog.  Field-bred dogs are selected for their sense of smell, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance.<ref name="spring.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.springerspaniel.org.uk/english_springer_spaniel.htm |work=SpringerSpaniel.org.uk |title=English Springer Spaniel |access-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509032143/http://www.springerspaniel.org.uk/english_springer_spaniel.htm |archive-date=9 May 2010  }}</ref>

Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, [[dewlap]]s and dangling flews. The tail is [[Docking (dog)|docked]] to a short stub in those [[Docking (dog)#Legal status of dog tail docking and ear cropping by country|countries that permit docking]]. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers.<ref name="spring.org"/>

The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the [[English Cocker Spaniel]] and at first glance, the only major difference is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant.<ref name="differences">{{cite web|last=Gormish |first=Denise |publisher=English Cocker Spaniel Club of America |url=http://www.ecsca.org/difference.html |title=A comparison of English Cocker Spaniels, American Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels |access-date=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121224038/http://ecsca.org/difference.html |archive-date=21 November 2010  }}</ref> The major differences between the [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Springer]] and the English Springer are that the Welsh have more limited colors and tend to be slightly smaller.

=== Coat and colors ===
Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months but shed occasionally in the autumn.<ref name="diff"/> The [[coat (dog)|coat]] comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

=== Sizes ===
Males in the show dog line are typically approximately {{convert|19|to|21|in|cm}} at the [[withers]] and weigh {{convert|40|to|60|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. According to the UK Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be {{convert|20|in|cm}} at the withers. The females should be {{convert|18|to|20|in|cm}} and usually {{convert|35|to|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Working types can be lighter in weight and finer in bone.<ref>{{cite web |title=English Springer Spaniel Standard |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breed-standards/gundog/spaniel-english-springer/ |website=The Kennel Club |access-date=12 February 2024}}</ref>

== History ==
The English physician [[John Caius]] described the spaniel in his book the ''Treatise of Englishe Dogs'' published in 1576. His book was the first work to describe the various British breeds by function.<ref name="arielhistory">{{cite web|first=Mindy|last=Mymudes|url=http://www.ariel-ess.com/essfaq/history.html|title=An English Springer History|date=3 March 2002|access-date=24 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120183121/http://www.ariel-ess.com/essfaq/history.html|archive-date=20 January 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> By 1801, [[Sydenham Edwards]] explained in the ''Cynographia Britannica'' that the land spaniel should be split into two kinds, the Springing, Hawking Spaniel, or Starter; and the Cocking or [[English Cocker Spaniel|Cocker Spaniel]].<ref name="arielhistory"/>

At this point, both cocker spaniels and springer spaniels were born in the same litters. The purpose of the breed was to serve as a hunting dog. The smaller cockers were used to hunt [[woodcock]], while their larger littermates, the springer spaniels, would "spring"—or flush—the [[gamebird]] into the air where a trained [[falcon]] or hawk would bring it to the handler.<ref name="akc">{{cite web| url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_springer_spaniel/| title=AKC MEET THE BREEDS: English Springer Spaniel| work=[[American Kennel Club]]| access-date=24 November 2010| archive-date=22 November 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122113434/http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_springer_spaniel/| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Many spaniel breeds were developed during the 19th century, and often named after the counties in which they were developed, or after their owners, who were usually nobility. Two strains of larger land spaniel were predominant and were said to have been of "true springer type." These were the [[Norfolk spaniel|Norfolk]] and the Shropshire spaniels, and by the 1850s, these were shown under the breed name of Norfolk spaniel.<ref name="westwing">{{cite web|url=http://www.westwingsess.com/ESS_History.htm |title=The History of the Springer Spaniel |access-date=24 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913111912/http://www.westwingsess.com/ESS_History.htm |archive-date=13 September 2009  }}</ref>

In January 1899, the Spaniel Club of England and the Sporting Spaniel Society held their trials together for the first time. Three years later, in 1902, a combination of the physical standard from the Spaniel Club of England and the ability standard from the Sporting Spaniel Society led to the English Springer Spaniel breed being officially recognized by the [[The Kennel Club|English Kennel Club]]. The [[American Kennel Club]] followed in 1910.<ref name="westwing"/> In 1914, the first English Field Champion was crowned, FTC Rivington Sam, whose dam was a registered cocker spaniel, Rivington Riband. Sam is considered one of the foundation sires for modern field lines.<ref name="westwing"/>

===Skills===
An English Springer Spaniel is foremost a [[game bird]] flushing dog. There are several skills that breeders train the dog to perform for their occupation.<ref name="skills">{{cite web|publisher=Petwave.com|url=http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Dog-Breed-Center/Sporting-Group/English-Springer-Spaniel/Field-Skills.aspx|title=English Springer Spaniel – Key Field Skills| access-date=25 October 2009}}</ref>
* '''Retrieve to Hand''' Most hunters and all [[hunt test]] or [[field trial]] judges require that a dog deliver a bird to hand, meaning that a dog will hold the bird until told to give it to the hunter directly.
* '''Soft Mouth''' Springers are taught to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not puncture it with his teeth. The game should always be ''fit for the table''. If a springer damages the bird, it may be hard-mouthed. This is a serious fault, but it can be difficult to determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard-mouthed.
* '''Quarter''' A flushing spaniel's primary role is often as a game bird flushing dog. Dogs must work in a zig-zag pattern in front of the hunter seeking game birds. The dog is taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside shooting distance. This pattern is one of the primary criteria used to judge a dog in a [[field trial]].
* '''Scenting''' Having the ability to scent game is of vital importance to the hunter. A springer should have a good nose in both wet and dry conditions. A dog with a good nose will learn to use the wind as it quests for game, ever adjusting its pattern according to the nuances of the wind.
* '''Flushing''' The springer should have a positive flush. It should not hesitate or point when encountering game. Some field trial dogs will often get airborne during a flush. This is exciting to watch but is not necessary to win. Most hunters prefer that their dog not flush in that style, as it can present a risk to the dog.
* '''Hup''' This is the traditional command to sit and stay. When hupped the dog can be given direction called by the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allows the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.
* '''Follow Hand Signals''' Game bird hunting involves pursuing wild game in its native habitat. Gun dogs must investigate likely covers for game birds. The dog must be responsive to hand signals for the hunter to be able to direct the dog into areas of particular interest.
* '''Steady''' When hunting game birds, a flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning that he sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. He does this to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds when pursuing a missed bird.
* '''Blind Retrieve''' An adequately trained and experienced working springer can be expected to use all of the aforementioned attributes to be conducted by hand, whistle and command to a position whereby an unmarked lost game bird can be picked and retrieved to hand.
