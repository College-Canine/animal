<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Hypophosphatemia''' is an [[electrolyte disorder]] in which there is a low level of [[phosphate]] in the [[blood]].<ref name=Mer2018/> Symptoms may include weakness, trouble breathing, and loss of appetite.<ref name=Mer2018/> Complications may include [[seizures]], [[coma]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], or [[osteomalacia|softening of the bones]].<ref name=Mer2018/>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Causes include [[alcohol use disorder]], [[refeeding syndrome|refeeding]] in those with [[malnutrition]], recovery from [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[burn]]s, [[hyperventilation]], and certain medications.<ref name=Mer2018/> It may also occur in the setting of [[hyperparathyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], and [[Cushing syndrome]].<ref name=Mer2018/> It is diagnosed based on a blood phosphate concentration of less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL).<ref name=Mer2018/> When levels are below 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) it is deemed to be severe.<ref name=Ad2012>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=James G. |title=Emergency Medicine: Clinical Essentials (Expert Consult - Online and Print) |date=2012 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-1455733941 |page=1416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpoH-KYE93IC&pg=PA1416 |language=en}}</ref>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
Treatment depends on the underlying cause.<ref name=Mer2018/> Phosphate may be given by mouth or by injection into a vein.<ref name=Mer2018/> Hypophosphatemia occurs in about 2% of people within hospital and 70% of people in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU).<ref name=Mer2018>{{cite web |title=Hypophosphatemia |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hypophosphatemia |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |access-date=28 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Yu2012>{{cite book |last1=Yunen |first1=Jose R. |title=The 5-Minute ICU Consult |date=2012 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=9781451180534 |page=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlDABaeQukIC&pg=PA152 |language=en}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
* Muscle dysfunction and weakness – This occurs in major muscles, but also may manifest as: [[diplopia]], low cardiac output, [[dysphagia]], and respiratory depression due to respiratory muscle weakness.
* Mental status changes – This may range from irritability to gross confusion, delirium, and coma.
* [[White blood cell]] dysfunction, causing worsening of infections.
* Instability of cell membranes due to low [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) levels – This may cause [[rhabdomyolysis]] with increased serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, and also [[hemolytic anemia]].
* Increased affinity for oxygen in the blood caused by decreased production of [[2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid]].
* If hypophosphatemia is chronic; rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults may develop.

==Causes==
* [[Refeeding syndrome]] – This causes a demand for phosphate in cells due to the action of [[hexokinase]], an enzyme that attaches phosphate to glucose to begin metabolism of glucose. Also, production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] when cells are fed and recharge their energy supplies requires phosphate. A similar mechanism is seen in the treatment of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pappoe |first1=Lamioko Shika |last2=Singh |first2=Ajay K. |title=Hypophosphatemia |journal=Decision Making in Medicine |date=2010 |pages=392–393 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-04107-2.50138-1|isbn=978-0-323-04107-2 }}</ref> which can be complicated by [[respiratory failure]] in these cases due to respiratory muscle weakness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Konstantinov |first1=NK |last2=Rohrscheib |first2=M |last3=Agaba |first3=EI |last4=Dorin |first4=RI |last5=Murata |first5=GH |last6=Tzamaloukas |first6=AH |title=Respiratory failure in diabetic ketoacidosis. |journal=World Journal of Diabetes |date=25 July 2015 |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=1009–1023 |pmid=26240698 |doi=10.4239/wjd.v6.i8.1009|pmc=4515441 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Choi |first1=HS |last2=Kwon |first2=A |last3=Chae |first3=HW |last4=Suh |first4=J |last5=Kim |first5=DH |last6=Kim |first6=HS |title=Respiratory failure in a diabetic ketoacidosis patient with severe hypophosphatemia. |journal=Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism |date=June 2018 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=103–106 |doi=10.6065/apem.2018.23.2.103 |pmid=29969883|pmc=6057019 }}</ref>
* [[Respiratory alkalosis]] – Any alkalemic condition moves phosphate out of the blood into cells. This includes most common respiratory alkalemia (a higher than normal blood pH from low carbon dioxide levels in the blood), which in turn is caused by any hyperventilation (such as may result from sepsis, fever, pain, anxiety, drug withdrawal, and many other causes).  This phenomenon is seen because in respiratory alkalosis carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) decreases in the extracellular space, causing intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> to freely diffuse out of the cell.  This drop in intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> causes a rise in cellular pH which has a stimulating effect on [[glycolysis]].  Since the process of glycolysis requires phosphate (the end product is [[adenosine triphosphate]]), the result is a massive uptake of phosphate into metabolically active tissue (such as muscle) from the serum.  However, that this effect is not seen in [[metabolic alkalosis]], for in such cases the cause of the alkalosis is increased bicarbonate rather than decreased CO<sub>2</sub>.  Bicarbonate, unlike CO<sub>2</sub>, has poor diffusion across the cellular membrane and therefore there is little change in intracellular pH.<ref name="obrien">{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien |first1=Thomas M|last2=Coberly|first2=LeAnn|year=2003|title=Severe Hypophosphatemia in Respiratory Alkalosis |journal=Advanced Studies in Medicine|volume=3|issue=6|pages=347 |url=http://www.jhasim.com/files/journal_p345%28V3-6%29ClinicalV.pdf|access-date=2011-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815161118/http://www.jhasim.com/files/journal_p345(V3-6)ClinicalV.pdf |archive-date=2012-08-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Alcohol use disorder]] – Alcohol impairs phosphate absorption. People who excessively consume alcohol are usually also malnourished with regard to minerals. In addition, alcohol treatment is associated with refeeding, which further depletes phosphate, and the stress of [[alcohol withdrawal]] may create respiratory alkalosis, which exacerbates hypophosphatemia (see above).
* [[Malabsorption]] – This includes gastrointestinal damage, and also failure to absorb phosphate due to lack of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as [[sucralfate]], aluminum-containing antacids, and (more rarely) calcium-containing antacids.
* Intravenous iron (usually for anemia) may cause hypophosphatemia. The loss of phosphate is predominantly the result of renal wasting. 

Primary hypophosphatemia is the most common cause of non-nutritional [[rickets]]. Laboratory findings include low-normal serum [[calcium]], moderately low serum [[phosphate]], elevated serum [[alkaline phosphatase]], and low serum 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D levels, [[hyperphosphaturia]], and no evidence of [[hyperparathyroidism]].<ref>Toy, Girardet, Hormann, Lahoti, McNeese, Sanders, and Yetman. ''Case Files: Pediatrics, Second Edition.'' 2007. McGraw Hill.</ref>

Hypophosphatemia decreases 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) causing a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

Other rarer causes include:
* Certain blood cancers such as lymphoma or leukemia
* [[Hereditary]] causes
* [[Liver failure]]
* [[Tumor-induced osteomalacia]]{{cn|date=April 2019}}

==Pathophysiology==
Hypophosphatemia is caused by the following three mechanisms:
* Inadequate intake (often unmasked in refeeding after long-term low phosphate intake)
* Increased excretion (e.g. in [[hyperparathyroidism]], hypophosphatemic rickets)
* Shift of phosphorus from the [[extracellular space|extracellular]] to the [[intracellular space]].{{clarify|date=October 2016}} This can be seen in treatment of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], refeeding, short-term increases in cellular demand (e.g. [[hungry bone syndrome]]) and acute [[respiratory alkalosis]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}

==Diagnosis==
Hypophosphatemia is diagnosed by measuring the concentration of phosphate in the blood. Concentrations of phosphate less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) are considered diagnostic of hypophosphatemia, though additional tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of the disorder.<ref name="Merck Manual Hypophos">{{cite web|title=Hypophosphatemia - Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-disorders/hypophosphatemia#v8376611|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.|access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Standard intravenous preparations of potassium phosphate are available and are routinely used in malnourished people and people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol. Supplementation by mouth is also useful where no intravenous treatment are available. Historically one of the first demonstrations of this was in people in concentration camp who died soon after being re-fed: it was observed that those given milk (high in phosphate) had a higher survival rate than those who did not get [[milk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
