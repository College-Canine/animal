In [[organic chemistry]], '''organophosphates''' (also known as '''phosphate esters''', or '''OPEs''') are a class of [[organophosphorus compound]]s with the general structure {{chem2|O\dP(OR)3}}, a central phosphate molecule with [[alkyl]] or [[Aryl|aromatic substituents]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Greaves|first1=Alana K.|last2=Letcher|first2=Robert J.|last3=Chen|first3=Da|last4=McGoldrick|first4=Daryl J.|last5=Gauthier|first5=Lewis T.|last6=Backus|first6=Sean M.|date=2016-10-01|title=Retrospective analysis of organophosphate flame retardants in herring gull eggs and relation to the aquatic food web in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935116302389|journal=[[Environmental Research]]|language=en|volume=150|pages=255–263|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.006|pmid=27322497|bibcode=2016ER....150..255G|issn=0013-9351}}</ref>  They can be considered as [[ester]]s of [[phosphoric acid]].

==Forms==
Organophosphates are a class of compounds encompassing a number of distinct but closely related [[function group]]s. These are primarily the [[ester]]s of [[phosphoric acid]] and can be mono‑esters, di‑esters or tri‑esters depending on the number of attached [[Organic compound|organic]] groups (abbreviated as 'R' in the image below).  In general man‑made organophosphates are most often triesters, while biological organophosphates are usually  mono- or di-esters. The hydolysis of triesters can form diesters and monoesters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Yaxin |last2=Gong |first2=Shuai |last3=Ye |first3=Langjie |last4=Li |first4=Jianhua |last5=Liu |first5=Chunsheng |last6=Chen |first6=Da |last7=Fang |first7=Mingliang |last8=Letcher |first8=Robert J. |last9=Su |first9=Guanyong |title=Organophosphate (OP) diesters and a review of sources, chemical properties, environmental occurrence, adverse effects, and future directions |journal=Environment International |date=October 2021 |volume=155 |pages=106691 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2021.106691|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[File:Phosphorsäureester.png|400px]]

In the context of pesticides, derivatives of organophosphates such as [[organothiophosphate]]s (P=S) or [[phosphorodiamidate]]s (P-N) are included as being organophosphates. The reason is that these compound are converted into organophosphates biologically.

[[File:Thiophosphorsäureester Dithiophosphorsäureester.svg|300px]]

In biology the esters of [[diphosphoric acid]] and [[triphosphoric acid]] are generally included as organophosphates. The reason is again a practical one, as many cellular processes involve the mono- di and tri- phosphates of the same compound. For instance, the phosphates of [[adenosine]] ([[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) play a key role in many metabolic processes.

[[File:Di u Triphosphorsäureester.png|475px]]

==Synthesis==
;Alcoholysis of {{chem2|POCl3}}
[[Phosphorus oxychloride]] reacts readily with [[alcohols]] to give organophosphates. This is the dominate industrial route and is responsible for almost all organophosphate production.

:{{chem2|O\dPCl3 + 3 ROH -> O\dP(OR)3 + 3 HCl}}

When aliphatic alcohols are used the HCl by-product can react with the phosphate esters to give [[organochloride]]s and a lower ester. 

:{{chem2|O\dP(OR)3 + HCl -> O\dP(OR)2OH + RCl}}

This reaction is usually undesirable and is exacerbated by high reaction temperatures. It can be inhibited by the use of a base or the removal of HCl through [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparging]].

;Esterification of phosphoric acid and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
[[Esterification]]s of [[phosphoric acid]] with alcohols proceed less readily than the more common [[carboxylic acid]] esterifications, with the reactions rarely proceeding much further than the phosphate mono-ester. The reaction requires high temperatures, under which the phosphoric acid can dehydrate to form poly-phosphoric acids. These are exceedingly viscous and their linear polymeric structure renders them less reactive than phosphoric acid.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arora |first1=Pinklesh |last2=Singh |first2=Rakhi |last3=Seshadri |first3=Geetha |last4=Tyagi |first4=Ajay Kumar |title=Synthesis, Properties and Applications of Anionic Phosphate Ester Surfactants: A Review |journal=Tenside Surfactants Detergents |date=16 July 2018 |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=266–272 |doi=10.3139/113.110570|s2cid=105424570 }}</ref> Despite these limitations the reaction does see industrial use for the formation of monoalkyl phosphates, which are used as [[surfactant]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tracy |first1=David J. |last2=Reierson |first2=Robert L. |title=Commercial synthesis of monoalkyl phosphates |journal=Journal of Surfactants and Detergents |date=April 2002 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=169–172 |doi=10.1007/s11743-002-0218-9|s2cid=96234775 }}</ref> A major appeal of this route is the low cost of phosphoric acid compared to phosphorus oxychloride. 

:{{chem2|OP(OH)3 + ROH -> OP(OH)2(OR) + H2O}}

[[P2O5|P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] is the anhydride of phosphoric acid and acts similarly. The reaction yields equimolar amounts of di- and monoesters with no phosphoric acid. The process is mostly limited to primary alcohols, as secondary alcohols are prone to undesirable side reactions such as dehydration.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arora |first1=Pinklesh |last2=Singh |first2=Rakhi |last3=Seshadri |first3=Geetha |last4=Tyagi |first4=Ajay Kumar |title=Synthesis, Properties and Applications of Anionic Phosphate Ester Surfactants: A Review |journal=Tenside Surfactants Detergents |date=16 July 2018 |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=266–272 |doi=10.3139/113.110570|s2cid=105424570 }}</ref>

;Oxidation of phosphite esters
[[Organophosphites]] can be easily oxidised to give organophosphates. This might ordinarily be considered a specialised method, however large quantities of organophosphites are produced as antioxidant [[Polymer stabilizers|stabilisers]] for plastics, with their gradual oxidation forming organophosphates in the human environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Runzeng |last2=Mabury |first2=Scott A. |title=Organophosphite Antioxidants in Indoor Dust Represent an Indirect Source of Organophosphate Esters |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |date=19 February 2019 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=1805–1811 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.8b05545|pmid=30657667 |s2cid=58665691 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bi |first1=Ruifeng |last2=Meng |first2=Weikun |last3=Su |first3=Guanyong |title=Organophosphate esters (OPEs) in plastic food packaging: non-target recognition, and migration behavior assessment |journal=Environment International |date=July 2023 |volume=177 |pages=108010 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2023.108010|pmid=37307603 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gong |first1=Xinying |last2=Zhang |first2=Wenjun |last3=Zhang |first3=Shuyi |last4=Wang |first4=Yu |last5=Zhang |first5=Xinyi |last6=Lu |first6=Yuan |last7=Sun |first7=Hongwen |last8=Wang |first8=Lei |title=Organophosphite Antioxidants in Mulch Films Are Important Sources of Organophosphate Pollutants in Farmlands |journal=Environmental Science & Technology |date=1 June 2021 |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=7398–7406 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.0c08741}}</ref>

;Phosphorylation
{{Main|Phosphorylation}}
The formation of organophosphates is an important part of biochemistry and living systems achieve this using a variety of [[enzyme]]s. Phosphorylation is essential to the processes of both [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] and [[aerobic respiration]], which involve the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the "high-energy" exchange medium in the cell.

==Properties==
===Bonding===
The bonding in organophosphates has been a matter of prolonged debate; the phosphorus atom is classically [[Hypervalent molecule|hypervalent]], as it possesses more bonds than the [[octet rule]] should allow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fugel |first1=Malte |last2=Malaspina |first2=Lorraine A. |last3=Pal |first3=Rumpa |last4=Thomas |first4=Sajesh P. |last5=Shi |first5=Ming W. |last6=Spackman |first6=Mark A. |last7=Sugimoto |first7=Kunihisa |last8=Grabowsky |first8=Simon |title=Revisiting a Historical Concept by Using Quantum Crystallography: Are Phosphate, Sulfate and Perchlorate Anions Hypervalent? |journal=Chemistry – A European Journal |date=7 May 2019 |volume=25 |issue=26 |pages=6523–6532 |doi=10.1002/chem.201806247|pmid=30759315 |s2cid=73451989 }}</ref> The focus of debate is usually on the nature of the [[phosphoryl]] P=O bond, which displays (in spite of the common depiction) non-classical bonding, with a [[bond order]] somewhere between 1 and 2. Early papers explained the hypervalence in terms of d-[[orbital hybridisation]], with the energy penalty of promoting electrons into the higher energy orbitals being off-set by the stabilisation of additional bonding.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cundari |first1=Thomas R. |title=Chemical bonding involving d-orbitals |journal=Chemical Communications |date=2013 |volume=49 |issue=83 |pages=9521–9525 |doi=10.1039/c3cc45204b|pmid=24013652 }}</ref> Later advances in computational chemistry showed that d-orbitals played little significant role in bonding.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Magnusson |first1=Eric |title=Hypercoordinate molecules of second-row elements: d functions or d orbitals? |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=October 1990 |volume=112 |issue=22 |pages=7940–7951 |doi=10.1021/ja00178a014}}</ref><ref name=Simons>{{cite journal |last1=Gamoke |first1=Benjamin |last2=Neff |first2=Diane |last3=Simons |first3=Jack |title=Nature of PO Bonds in Phosphates |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A |date=14 May 2009 |volume=113 |issue=19 |pages=5677–5684 |doi=10.1021/jp810014s|pmid=19378976 }}</ref> Current models rely on either [[negative hyperconjugation]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rajani |first1=Puchakayala |last2=Gopakumar |first2=Gopinadhanpillai |last3=Nagarajan |first3=Sivaraman |last4=Brahmmananda Rao |first4=Cherukuri Venkata Siva |title=Does the basicity of phosphoryl oxygen change with alkyl chain length in phosphate ligands? |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |date=July 2021 |volume=775 |pages=138641 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2021.138641|s2cid=234836388 }}</ref> or a more complex arraignment with a [[coordinate covalent bond|dative]]-type bond from P to O, combined with back-donation from a 2p orbital on the oxygen.<ref name=Simons /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chesnut |first1=D.

It has been argued that a more accurate depiction is dipolar (i.e. (RO)<sub>3</sub>P<sup>+</sup>-O<sup>-</sup>),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rai |first1=Uma S. |last2=Symons |first2=Martyn C.

Soc., Faraday Trans. |date=1994 |volume=90 |issue=18 |pages=2649–2652 |doi=10.1039/FT9949002649}}</ref> which is similar to the depiction [[Ylide|phosphorus ylides]] such as [[methylenetriphenylphosphorane]]. However in contrast to ylides, the phosphoryl group is unreactive and organophosphates are poor nucleophiles, despite the high concentration of charge on the phosphoryl oxygen. The polarisation accounts in part for the higher melting points of phosphates when compared to their corresponding [[phosphite]]s. The bonding in penta-coordinate [[phosphoranes]] (i.e. P(OR)<sub>5</sub>) is entirely different and involves [[three-center four-electron bond]]s.

===Acidity===
Phosphate esters bearing P-OH groups are [[acid]]ic. The pKa of the first OH group is typically between 1-2, with the second OH [[deprotonation|deprotonating]] at a pKa of 6-7.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kumler |first1=W.

===Water solubility===
The water solubility of organophosphates is an important factor in biological, industrial and environmental settings.  The wide variety of substitutes used in organophosphate esters results in great variations in physical properties. OPEs exhibit a wide range of octanol/water [[partition coefficient]]s where log Kow values range from -0.98 up to 10.6.<ref name=":4" /> Mono- and di- esters are usually water soluble, particularity biomolecules. Tri-esters such as flame retardants and plasticisers have positive log Kow values ranging between 1.44 and 9.49, signifying [[hydrophobicity]].<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Möller |first1=A. |last2=Sturm |first2=R. |last3=Xie |first3=Z. |last4=Cai |first4=M. |last5=He |first5=J. |last6=Ebinghaus |first6=R. |date=2012 |title=Organophosphorus Flame Retardants and Plasticizers in Airborne Particles over the Northern Pacific and Indian Ocean toward the Polar Regions: Evidence for Global Occurrence |url=https://doi.org/10.1021/es204272v |journal=Environmental Science and Technology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=3127–3134 | pmid=22332897 | doi=10.1021/es204272v|bibcode=2012EnST...46.3127M }}</ref><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{cite journal |last1=Greaves |first1=Alana K. |last2=Letcher |first2=Robert J. |title=A Review of Organophosphate Esters in the Environment from Biological Effects to Distribution and Fate |journal=Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |date=January 2017 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.1007/s00128-016-1898-0|pmid=27510993 |s2cid=19824807 }}</ref> Hydrophobic OPEs are more likely to be bioaccumulated and biomagnified in aquatic ecosystems.<ref name=":5" /> Halogenated organophosphates tend to be denser than water and sink, causing them to accumulate in sediments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McDonough|first1=Carrie A.|last2=De Silva|first2=Amila O.|last3=Sun|first3=Caoxin|last4=Cabrerizo|first4=Ana|last5=Adelman|first5=David|last6=Soltwedel|first6=Thomas|last7=Bauerfeind|first7=Eduard|last8=Muir|first8=Derek C.

===Pesticides{{anchor|Insecticides}}===
[[File:Malathion.png|thumb|right|[[Malathion]], one of the first organophosphate insecticides. It remains important as a Vector control agent.]]

Organophosphates are best known for their use as pesticides.

Health concerns have seen their use significantly decrease since the turn of the century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Status and Trends of Pesticide Use |url=https://wedocs.unep.org/20.500.11822/40351 |website=United Nations Environment Programme |publisher=World Health Organization, & Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=2022}}</ref><ref name=Vector-trends>{{cite journal |last1=van den Berg |first1=Henk |last2=da Silva Bezerra |first2=Haroldo Sergio |last3=Al-Eryani |first3=Samira |last4=Chanda |first4=Emmanuel |last5=Nagpal |first5=Bhupender N. |last6=Knox |first6=Tessa B. |last7=Velayudhan |first7=Raman |last8=Yadav |first8=Rajpal S. |title=Recent trends in global insecticide use for disease vector control and potential implications for resistance management |journal=Scientific Reports |date=13 December 2021 |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=23867 |doi=10.1038/s41598-021-03367-9|pmid=34903838 |pmc=8669011 }}</ref> [[Glyphosate]] is sometimes called an organophosphate, but is in-fact a [[phosphonate]].

The development of organophosphate insecticides and the earliest [[nerve agent]]s was conjoined, with Schrader also developing the nerve agents [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[sarin]]. Organophosphate pesticides were not commercialised until after WWII. [[Parathion]] was among the first marketed, followed by [[malathion]] and [[azinphosmethyl]] <!--very early ones may have also included [[dimefox]], [[diisopropyl fluorophosphate]], [[Schradan]] and Bladan ([[Hexaethyl tetraphosphate]]?) -->. Although organophosphates were used in considerable qualities they were originally less important than [[organochlorine]] insecticides such as [[DDT]], [[dieldrin]], and [[heptachlor]]. When many of the organochlorines were banned in the 1970s, following the publishing of [[Silent Spring]], organophosphates became the most important class of insecticides globally. Nearly 100 were commercialised, with the following being a varied selection:

Organophosphates act multifunctionally to retard fire in both the gas phase and condensed (solid) phase. Halogenated organophosphates are more active overall as their degradation products interfere with combustion directly in the gas phase. All organophosphates have activity in the condensed phase, by forming phosphorus acids which promote [[Charring|char]] formation, insulating the surface from heat and air. 

Organophosphates were originally thought to be a safe replacements for brominated flame retardants, however many are now coming under regulatory pressure due to their apparent health risks.<ref name=ECHA-PFR /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Arlene |last2=Behl |first2=Mamta |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Linda S. |last4=Diamond |first4=Miriam L. |last5=Phillips |first5=Allison |last6=Singla |first6=Veena |last7=Sipes |first7=Nisha S. |last8=Stapleton |first8=Heather M. |last9=Venier |first9=Marta |title=Organophosphate Ester Flame Retardants: Are They a Regrettable Substitution for Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers? |journal=Environmental Science & Technology Letters |date=12 November 2019 |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=638–649 |doi=10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00582|doi-access=free|pmid=32494578 |pmc=7269169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Du |first1=Jia |last2=Li |first2=Huanxuan |last3=Xu |first3=Shaodan |last4=Zhou |first4=Qingwei |last5=Jin |first5=Meiqing |last6=Tang |first6=Junhong |title=A review of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs): occurrence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and organism exposure |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |date=August 2019 |volume=26 |issue=22 |pages=22126–22136 |doi=10.1007/s11356-019-05669-y|pmid=31243659 |s2cid=195694322 }}</ref> The chlorinated organophosphates may be carcinogenic, while others such as [[tricresyl phosphate]] have necrotoxic properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barth |first1=Mary L. |last2=Craig |first2=Peter H. |title=Evaluation of the hazards of industrial exposure to tricresyl phosphate:a review and interpretation of the literature |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |date=October 1999 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=281–300 |doi=10.1080/109374099281142|pmid=10596299 }}</ref>

Plasticisers are added to polymers and plastics to improve their flexibility and processability, giving a softer more easily deformable material. In this way brittle polymers can be made more durable. Organophosphates find use because they are multifunctional; primarily plasticising but also imparting flame resistance. The most frequently plasticised polymers are the vinyls ([[PVC]], [[Polyvinyl butyral|PVB]], [[poly(vinyl acetate)|PVA]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride acetate|PVCA]]), as well as cellulose plastics ([[cellulose acetate]], [[nitrocellulose]] and [[cellulose acetate butyrate]]).<ref name=Ullmann's>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cadogan DF, Howick CJ |title=Plasticizers |journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=15 June 2000 |volume=27 |pages=613–614 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a20_439|isbn=3527306730 }}</ref> PVC dominates the market, consuming 80-90% of global plasticiser production.<ref name=Ullmann's /><ref name=Plast-market>{{cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=M |last2=Brazel |first2=C |title=The plasticizer market: an assessment of traditional plasticizers and research trends to meet new challenges |journal=Progress in Polymer Science |date=December 2004 |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1223–1248 |doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2004.10.001}}</ref> PVC can accept large amounts of plasticiser; in extreme cases an item may be 70-80% plasticiser by mass, but loadings of between 0-50% are more common.<ref name="additives handbook">{{cite book | vauthors = Krauskopf LG |title=Plastics additives handbook |date=2009 |publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-446-40801-2 |pages=485–511 |edition=6. |chapter=3.13 Plasticizers}}</ref> The main applications of these products are in wire and cable insulation, flexible pipe, automotive interiors, plastic sheeting, [[sheet vinyl flooring|vinyl flooring]], and toys.

===Hydraulic fluids and lubricant additives===
Similar to their use as plastisiers, organophosphates are well suited to use as [[hydraulic fluid]]s due to their low freezing points and high boiling points, fire-resistance, non-corrosiveness, excellent boundary lubrication properties and good general chemical stability. The triaryl phosphates are the most important group, with tricresyl phosphate being the first to be commercialised in the 1940s, with [[trixylyl phosphate]] following shortly after. Butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and propylphenyl diphenyl phosphate became available after 1960.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rudnick |first=L.R. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YXRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA81 |title=Synthetics, Mineral Oils, and Bio-Based Lubricants: Chemistry and Technology, Second Edition |publisher=CRC Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4398-5538-6 |series=Chemical Industries |pages=81–104 |chapter=Chapter 4: Neutral Phosphate Esters |doi=10.1201/9781315158150-4 |s2cid=235095497 |access-date=2024-01-07}}</ref>
