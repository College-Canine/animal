'''''Proteus mirabilis''''' is a [[Gram-negative]], facultatively [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], rod-shaped [[bacterium]]. It shows [[swarming motility]] and [[urease]] activity. ''P. mirabilis'' causes 90% of all ''Proteus'' infections in humans. It is widely distributed in soil and water.<ref>{{cite web | title = Proteus mirabilis | quote = Bacteria of the species ''Proteus mirabilis'' are widely distributed in soil and water in the natural environment.

''Proteus mirabilis'' is most frequently associated with [[Urinary tract infection|infections of the urinary tract]], especially in complicated or catheter-associated urinary tract infections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CY, Chen YH, Lu PL, Lin WR, Chen TC, Lin CY | title = Proteus mirabilis urinary tract infection and bacteremia: risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–236 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22572004 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.11.007 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
An [[alkaline]] [[urine]] sample is a possible sign of ''P. mirabilis''.  It can be diagnosed in the lab due to characteristic swarming motility, and inability to metabolize [[lactose]] (on a [[MacConkey agar]] plate, for example). Also ''P. mirabilis'' produces a very distinct fishy odor.

==Disease==
This rod-shaped bacterium has the ability to produce high levels of [[urease]], which hydrolyzes [[urea]] to [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), so makes the urine more alkaline. Prolonged increased alkalinity can lead to the formation of [[crystal]]s of [[struvite]], [[calcium carbonate]], and/or [[apatite]], which can result in [[struvite]] kidney stones. Delayed or suboptimal treatment often allows these kidney stones to act as a nidus for ''P. mirabilis'' growth causing recurrent infections despite antibiotic treatment. If the stones grow large enough they can cause obstruction and [[kidney failure]]. ''Proteus'' species can also cause wound infections, sepsis, and pneumonia, mostly in hospitalized patients.<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Proteus mirabilis'' and Urinary Tract Infection | url = http://www.bact.wisc.edu/Microtextbook/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=254&page=1 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311064203/http://www.bact.wisc.edu/Microtextbook/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=254&page=1 | archive-date = 11 March 2007 | date = 11 March 2007 | work =  Microbiology Textbook | vauthors = Paustian TD | publisher = University of Wisconsin - Madison }}</ref>

This species' ability to inhibit growth of unrelated strains had been a topic for scientific curiosity, which then resulted in the discovery a macroscopically visible line of reduced bacterial growth where two swarming strains intersect.

== Swarming motility ==
Swarming is a specialized form of motility that groups of multicellular, flagellated bacteria can undergo to expand their populations to new locations.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Howery KE, Clemmer KM, Şimşek E, Kim M, Rather PN | title = Regulation of the Min Cell Division Inhibition Complex by the Rcs Phosphorelay in Proteus mirabilis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 197 | issue = 15 | pages = 2499–2507 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25986901 | pmc = 4518839 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00094-15 | veditors = Armitage JP }}</ref> The swarming capability of ''Proteus mirabilis'' is important because it is implicated in the pathogenesis of the bacteria and the swarming capability is associated with the bacteria's ability to express virulence factors<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rather PN | title = Swarmer cell differentiation in Proteus mirabilis | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 1065–1073 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16011745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00806.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> ''Proteus mirabilis'' has a very characteristic bulls-eye appearance on an agar plate due to the regular periodic cycling between the vegetative and swarming state of the cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morgenstein RM, Szostek B, Rather PN | title = Regulation of gene expression during swarmer cell differentiation in Proteus mirabilis | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 753–763 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20497230 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2010.00229.x | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In liquid culture, ''Proteus mirabilis'' exists as a vegetative cell that is approximately 2&nbsp;µm long and has four to ten peritrichous flagella. In the vegetative cell the flagella are used to propel the bacterium forward. Swarming cells are only formed when the bacteria are grown on solid surfaces so the ability to detect these solid surfaces is a required feature. It has been proposed that ''Proteus mirabilis'' senses a solid surface by the inhibition of its flagellum rotation, and it is this lack of freely rotating flagella that let the bacteria know it is on a solid surface. When ''Proteus mirabilis'' encounters a solid surface, and other necessary conditions have been met, the cell will undergo the differentiation process into a swarmer cell. This differentiation process includes the elongation of the cell 20 to 50 times longer than the vegetative cell, multinucleation, and more than a 50-fold greater surface density of flagella.<ref name=":0" />

The swarming process continues as periodic cycles of cell differentiation, population migration, and consolidation as the bacteria undergo these changes in response to environmental stimulants. The repetition of this cycle is what gives ''Proteus mirabilis'' its distinctive bulls-eye pattern when growing on solid media. This pattern can be used to distinguish ''Proteus mirabilis'' from other species of swarming bacteria. Each ring is formed when the bacteria is in the consolidation stage and the bacteria is increasing in population.<ref name=":1" />
