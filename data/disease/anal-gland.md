== Other animals ==

=== Dogs and cats ===
[[File:Anal gland abscess.JPG|thumb|Anal gland [[abscess]] on a dog]]

Dogs and cats primarily use their anal gland secretions to mark their [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and generally will secrete small amounts of fluid every time they [[Defecation|defecate]]. Many will often express these glands when anxious or frightened as well. Dogs who are healthy can usually have a wide variety in the appearance of their sac's content.<ref name=":6" /> Anal sac fluid varies from yellow to tan or brown in color. The consistency of the fluid ranges from thin, watery secretions to thick, gritty paste. There can also be a range in the malodorousness, or how strongly the contents smell.<ref name=":6" /> These factors can all be different from animal to animal.<ref name=":6" />

The inability to effectively express this fluid can lead to anal sacculitis. This is characterized by a build-up of fluid in the anal sac, an uncomfortable condition that can lead to pain and itching. Dogs and cats of any age may be affected, but dogs are far more likely to suffer from anal sacculitis than cats. Dogs and cats with anal glands that do not express naturally may exhibit specific signs, such as scooting the backside upon the ground, straining to defecate, and excessive licking of the anus. Cats may also defecate in areas outside the litter box.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vetstream.com/treat/canis/diseases/anal-sacculitis|title=Anal sacculitis in dogs {{!}} Vetlexicon Canis from Vetstream {{!}} Definitive Veterinary Intelligence|website=www.vetstream.com|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

Discomfort may also be evident with impaction or infection of the anal glands. Anal sac impaction results from blockage of the duct leading from the gland to the opening. The sac is usually non-painful and swollen. Anal sac infection results in pain, swelling, and sometimes [[abscess]]ation and fever.

Initial treatment usually involves the manual expression of the anal sacs, most often by a veterinary professional. The frequency of this procedure depends on the patient's individual degree of discomfort but can range from weekly to every few months.<ref name=":0" /> Treatment may include [[Incision and drainage|lancing]] of an abscess or [[antibiotic]] infusion into the gland in the case of infection. The most common bacterial [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolate]]s from anal gland infection are ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'', ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', and ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' species.<ref name="Ettinger_1995">{{cite book| vauthors = Ettinger SJ, Feldman EC |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref> Increasing [[dietary fiber]] is also commonly recommended.<ref name=":0" />

Anal sacs may be removed surgically in a procedure known as anal sacculectomy. This is usually done in the case of recurrent infection or because of the presence of an [[anal sac adenocarcinoma]], a malignant [[Neoplasm|tumor]].  Potential complications include [[fecal incontinence]] (especially when both glands are removed), [[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]] from [[Stenosis|stricture]] or scar formation, and persistent draining [[fistula]]e.<ref name=Hill>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill LN, Smeak DD | title = Open versus closed bilateral anal sacculectomy for treatment of non-neoplastic anal sac disease in dogs: 95 cases (1969-1994) | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 221 | issue = 5 | pages = 662–665 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12216905 | doi = 10.2460/javma.2002.221.662 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Opossums ===
[[Didelphimorphia|Opossums]] use their anal glands when they "[[play possum]]". As the opossum mimics death, the glands secrete a foul-smelling liquid, suggesting the opossum is rotting. Opossums are not members of the order Carnivora, and their anal sacs differ from those of dogs and their relatives.<ref name="Ford" />

=== Skunks ===
[[Skunk]]s use their anal glands to spray a foul-smelling and sticky fluid as a defense against predators.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}

==== Beavers ====
Both female and male beavers (''Castor canadensis'') have a pair of castor sacs and a pair of anal glands between the pelvis and tail. The physiology of the castor sac is unique to the beaver and contains an outer, vascular layer of connective tissue, a thicker layer of epithelial cells, and an inner packed layer of epithelial sheets.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walro JM, Svendsen GE | title = Castor sacs and anal glands of the north american beaver (Castor canadensis): their histology, development, and relationship to scent communication | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 809–819 | date = May 1982 | pmid = 24415179 | doi = 10.1007/BF00994781 | s2cid = 19327243 }}</ref> Castoreum is the chemical compound that is secreted from the castor sacs and is originally a thin, yellowish liquid. It is composed of a mixture of varied metabolic compounds, from the sacs and other bodily systems, and excreted urine.<ref name=":1" /> An extraction of [[castoreum]], the scent glands from the male and female [[beaver]] are used in perfumery and as a flavor ingredient.

The vestibule of the anal glands are connected to the ducts of the castor glands. The anal glands of beavers are characterized as holocrine sebaceous glands, which means they secrete substances by disintegrating cells in the process.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Svendsen GE, Jollick JD |date=1978 |title=Bacterial contents of the anal and castor glands of beaver (Castor canadensis) |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00988920 |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |language=en |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=563–569 |doi=10.1007/BF00988920 |s2cid=25447438 |issn=0098-0331}}</ref> Variations in color of anal glands range from a light straw color to brown. Compared to the castor sacs, anal glands secrete a much more sharp odor.<ref name=":2" /> Beavers do have a presence of bacterial flora in their anal glands, with the most abundant being ''B. fragilis'' and ''E. coli''. These two bacteria are common in the digestive tracts of mammals and are seen across all beaver populations regardless of sex, colony, age, class, and other factors.<ref name=":2" /> This gives evidence to the idea that beavers do not have varied bacterial flora or significant varied odors within a family. Furthermore, this opposes the bacterial fermentation hypothesis that is common among a number of mammalian species.<ref name=":1" />

Beavers create scent mounds, which are essentially “mud pies”, where they deposit castoreum and other secretions on top of them. As scent communication is a common method across many species, beavers use scent mounds as a way to alert that a region is inhabited by a family of beavers and to mark territory.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Svendsen GE |date=1980 |title=Patterns of scent-mounding in a population of beaver (Castor canadensis) |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |language=en |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=133–148 |doi=10.1007/BF00987533 |s2cid=22234085 |issn=0098-0331}}</ref> The frequency of scent mounding is typically highest during the spring and after winter when the ice has melted. This is prevalent as the water sources are more available from which beavers can gather mud.<ref name=":3" /> Scent mounding is highest during intergroup interactions, vicinity of abutting beaver populations, and gestation periods.<ref name=":3" /> Scent mounds are mainly a medium of communication against adjacent beaver populations and it prevents the exploitation of food resources, marks distinct family territories, and prevents extreme colonization of a habitat.<ref name=":3" />

==== Badgers ====
The [[European badger]] (''Meles meles''), a nocturnal carnivore, has a powerful [[olfactory system]].<ref name=":03">{{cite journal | vauthors = Raymer J, Wiesler D, Novotny M, Asa C, Seal US, Mech LD | title = Chemical investigations of wolf (Canis lupus) anal-sac secretion in relation to breeding season | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 593–608 | date = May 1985 | pmid = 24310125 | doi = 10.1007/BF00988570 | s2cid = 26151726 }}</ref> Anal gland secretions (AGS) of badgers are not commonly studied but contribute to key information for communication due to [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs).<ref name=":03"/> Like many other carnivorous mammals, such as mongoose, bears, and otters, they can detect sex differences from the different ratios of compounds of VOCs.<ref name=":03"/> VOCs in AGS of badger samples have individual-specific information, including health, fitness, reproductive status, and group membership.<ref name=":03"/> Male badgers react differently to VOCs in AGS from fertile females versus non-fertile females.<ref name=":03"/> The VOCs can change yearly based on diet and environmental factors, and seasonal changes of VOCs are influenced by breeding season.<ref name=":03"/>

In the majority of mammals, group integration is performed by the adult. However, in badgers cubs begin this gradual process (14–16 weeks).<ref name=":22">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin YW, Buesching CD, Burke T, Macdonald DW | title = Molecular characterization of the microbial communities in the subcaudal gland secretion of the European badger (Meles meles) | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 648–659 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22530962 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01396.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Badgers have the reputation of being aggressive towards one another and cubs are often victims to [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].<ref name=":22" /> To lower aggression within a group of badgers, members will [[Social grooming|allogroom]] (a form of social grooming) or allomark (transferring scents between other group members) more frequent and intense during spring months.<ref name=":22" /> Maturing cubs rub themselves against adult badger's subcaudal region via allomarking.<ref name=":22" /> This is also referred to as “scent theft” as cubs that do this have the same group scent.<ref name=":22" /> Badger cubs do not have the subcaudal gland secretion ability until approximately four months old .<ref name=":22" />

==== Wolves ====
Volatile compounds found in the anal sac secretions of intact males, intact females, [[castrate]] males, ovariectomized females, and [[Anosmia|anosmic]]/ pinealectomized males and females were analyzed using [[gas chromatography]].<ref name=":03"/> The volatile compounds found in the anal-gland secretions were largely [[Alcohol (chemistry)|alcohols]], [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s.<ref name=":03" /> Of the volatile compounds that were analyzed, the relative quantities of volatile compounds present in the test subjects’ anal sac secretions varied significantly between secretions collected outside and during mating season.<ref name=":03" /> This indicates that the volatile compounds in the anal sac secretions are used to signal information like gender and reproductive status.<ref name=":03" /> Results of this study indicated that some of the volatile compounds, specifically 2-octenal, 2-octen-1-ol and [[indole]], were produced by [[microbes]].<ref name=":03" />

==== Indian mongoose ====
The anal gland of the [[Indian mongoose]] consists of large [[sebaceous gland]]s that surround the anus, called the anal sac.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Gorman M, Nedwell DB, Smith RM |date=1974 |title=An analysis of the contents of the anal scent pockets of Herpestes auropunctatus (Carnivora: Viverridae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |language=en |volume=172 |issue=3 |pages=389–399 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1974.tb04115.x |issn=0952-8369}}</ref> The anal sac remains covered in sebum and remains closed when the tail of the mongoose is down but opens when the tail is raised.<ref name=":13" /> Inside the anal sacs are the ducts of the two anal pockets that lie on either side of the anus.<ref name=":13" /> The mongoose marks objects in its habitat by rubbing that object with the anal area leaving behind the distinct scent of [[carboxylic acid]]s.<ref name=":13" /> Contents of the anal pocket secretions revealed 6 saturated carboxylic acids: [[Acetic acid|acetic]], [[Propionic acid|propionic]], [[Isobutyric acid|isobutyric]], [[Butyric acid|butyric]], [[Isovaleric Acid|isovaleric]] and [[Valeric acid|valeric]].<ref name=":13" /> There are currently no notable differences in the chemicals found in the anal pocket secretions between the sexes.<ref name=":13" />

Evidence shows that the carboxylic acids found in the anal pocket secretions are produced by bacterial [[metabolism]] of contents inside the sebum.<ref name=":13" /> The bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions have been identified as ''Peptococcus'' ''spp.'', ''Peptostreptococcus plagarumbelli'', ''Bacillus cereus'' and ''Eubacterium'' or ''Catenobacterium'' ''spp''.<ref name=":13" /> These bacterial species have been found to produce carboxylic acids within the anal pocket.<ref name=":13" />

==== Hyenas ====
[[Hyena]]s are known to engage in “pasting” which is a type of scent marking behavior. This paste is rich in lipid sebum and epithelial cells, and is produced by sebaceous glands which then go directly into the anal glands and on top of a grass stalk.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Theis KR, Schmidt TM, Holekamp KE | title = Evidence for a bacterial mechanism for group-specific social odors among hyenas | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 615 | date = 2012-08-30 | pmid = 22937224 | doi = 10.1038/srep00615 | pmc = 3431069 | bibcode = 2012NatSR...2E.615T }}</ref> The organ that provides this paste, the anal glands, are occupied by microbes. Although both species of hyena contain fermentative bacteria, the microbes found in the anal gland of [[spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') differ from the microbes found in [[striped hyena]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Theis KR, Venkataraman A, Dycus JA, Koonter KD, Schmitt-Matzen EN, Wagner AP, Holekamp KE, Schmidt TM | display-authors = 6 | title = Symbiotic bacteria appear to mediate hyena social odors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 49 | pages = 19832–19837 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24218592 | pmc = 3856825 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1306477110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..11019832T | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The spotted hyena paste holds many populations of coccus and rod shaped bacteria. A survey found that Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria are the most common bacteria found in the hyena paste.<ref name=":4" /> Although many bacteria have been identified, around half are still unidentified.<ref name=":4" />

Microbiome populations also vary by sex and age. The adult and juvenile hyenas’ anal glands have the least diverse microbiota of their whole body. For females, the most common bacteria found in their paste was [[Anaerococcus]], [[Anaerovorax]], [[Corynebacterium]], [[Eubacterium]], [[Heleococcus|Helcococcus]], [[Porphyromonas]], and [[Propionibacterium]].<ref name=":4" /> Compared to the male hyenas which have a different microbiota than female hyenas. Juvenile males have more [[Prevotella]] and Firmicutes, while juvenile females have more [[Corynebacterium]] and Clostridiales. There is also a difference between adult female hyenas and juvenile hyenas. Juvenile female hyenas have more [[Erysipelotrichaceae]] and [[Helicobacter]] than the adult hyenas. These bacteria are common to the milk that hyenas feed their young.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Body site-specific microbiota reflect sex and age-class among wild spotted hyenas |url=https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/96/2/fiaa007/5700710 |access-date=2022-04-25 }}</ref>

==== Dogs and domestic cats ====
The bacteria found in the feces and anal glands of dogs and cats are also found in their mouths due to the consistent exposure to their backsides (licking and chewing).<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Devriese LA, Cruz Colque JI, De Herdt P, Haesebrouck F | title = Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats | journal = The Journal of Applied Bacteriology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–425 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1447058 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2672.1992.tb04998.x }}</ref> In a healthy dog or cat the bacteria normally found in their feces are [[Streptococcus|Streptococci]] and [[Enterococcus|Enterococci]], more specifically, [[Enterococcus faecium]], [[Streptococcus bovis]], and [[Enterococcus faecalis]].<ref name=":5" />
