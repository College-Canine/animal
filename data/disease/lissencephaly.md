'''Lissencephaly''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɪ|s|.|ɛ|n|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|.|ə|l|.|i}}, meaning 'smooth brain')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/lissencephaly-Information-Page|title=Lissencephaly Information Page|website=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> is a set of rare brain disorders whereby the whole or parts of the surface of the [[brain]] appear smooth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Case Files. Neurology|last1=Toy|first1=Eugene|last2=Simpson|first2=Ericka|last3=Tinter|first3=Ron|date=2013|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-176170-3|edition= 2nd|page=421}}</ref> It is caused by [[Neuronal migration disorder|defective neuronal migration]] during the 12th to 24th weeks of [[gestation]] resulting in a lack of development of brain folds ([[gyrus|gyri]]) and grooves ([[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobyns WB | title = Developmental aspects of lissencephaly and the lissencephaly syndromes | journal = Birth Defects Original Article Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 225–41 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3472611 }}</ref> It is a form of [[cephalic disorder]]. Terms such as ''agyria'' (no gyri) and ''[[pachygyria]]'' (broad gyri) are used to describe the appearance of the surface of the brain.

Children with lissencephaly generally have significant developmental delays, but these vary greatly from child to child depending on the degree of brain malformation and seizure control. Life expectancy can be shortened, generally due to respiratory problems.

==Symptoms and signs==
[[File:Lissencephaly.png|thumb|MRI scan showing the characteristic smooth brain of an individual with lissencephaly]]
Affected children display severe [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor impairment]], [[failure to thrive]], [[seizure]]s, and muscle [[spasticity]] or [[hypotonia]].<ref name=Jones06>{{cite book |author=Jones, KL |title=Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |edition= 6th}}</ref> Other symptoms of the disorder may include unusual facial appearance, difficulty swallowing, and anomalies of the hands, [[finger]]s, or [[toe]]s.

Symptoms of lissencephaly are detected via [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] at about twenty-three weeks and require confirmation from a prenatal [[MRI]]. It is characterised by absence or reduction of the [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and [[gyrus|gyri]] of the cerebral surface and a thickened cortex.<ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fong KW, Ghai S, Toi A, Blaser S, Winsor EJ, Chitayat D | title = Prenatal ultrasound findings of lissencephaly associated with Miller-Dieker syndrome and comparison with pre- and postnatal magnetic resonance imaging | journal = Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 716–23 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15586369 | doi = 10.1002/uog.1777 | s2cid = 41862127 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

There are anatomical symptoms that differ across the two main types of lissencephaly, Classical (Type I) and Cobble Stone (Type 2). In Classical lissencephaly the cortex becomes thickened and can be identified by four layers of the [[cerebral cortex]] rather than six.<ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20190213233203"/>

Cobblestone lissencephaly is named after the pebbled or cobblestone appearance of the cortical surface. This uneven cortical surface is due to incomplete organogenesis which leads to no distinguishable layers in the cerebral cortex. Cobblestone lissencephaly shows a reduction and abnormalities in the [[grey matter]] of the cerebral cortex.<ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20190213233203"/>

==Causes==
Causes of lissencephaly can include [[virus|viral]] infections of the uterus or the fetus during the first trimester,<ref name="pmid18723971">{{cite journal | vauthors = Joseph LD, Kuruvilla S | title = Cytomegalovirus infection with lissencephaly | journal = Indian Journal of Pathology & Microbiology | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 402–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18723971 | doi = 10.4103/0377-4929.42534 | doi-access = free }}</ref> or insufficient blood supply to the fetal brain early in pregnancy. There are also a number of genetic causes of lissencephaly, including mutation of the [[reelin]] gene (on [[chromosome 7]]),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hong SE, Shugart YY, Huang DT, Shahwan SA, Grant PE, Hourihane JO, Martin ND, Walsh CA | s2cid = 67748801 | title = Autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with human RELN mutations | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–6 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10973257 | doi = 10.1038/79246 }}</ref> as well as other genes on the [[X chromosome]] and on [[chromosome 17]]. [[Genetic counseling]] is usually offered if there is a risk of lissencephaly, coupled with [[genetic testing]].

===Neuronal migration===
Folding of the [[cerebral cortex]] is important in the development of overall brain function and cognitive abilities.<ref name="renamed_from_2_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernández V, Llinares-Benadero C, Borrell V | title = Cerebral cortex expansion and folding: what have we learned? | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 10 | pages = 1021–44 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27056680 | pmc = 4868950 | doi = 10.15252/embj.201593701 }}</ref> [[Neuronal migration]] is the process by which neurons migrate to the final position in the brain during the development of the [[nervous system]].<ref name="renamed_from_3_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Setty Y, Chen CC, Secrier M, Skoblov N, Kalamatianos D, Emmott S | title = How neurons migrate: a dynamic in-silico model of neuronal migration in the developing cortex | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 5 | pages = 154 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21962057 | pmc = 3198702 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-5-154 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This development of the nervous system occurs between 12 and 16 weeks of [[gestation]].<ref name="renamed_from_3_on_20190213233203"/> The neurons are created at the [[ventricular zone]].<ref name="renamed_from_2_on_20190213233203"/> The neurons then extend along the [[radial glia]] to reach the cortical zone. It is the disruption of the radial and tangential migration that causes reduced or absence [[gyri]] that is known as lissencephaly.<ref name="renamed_from_4_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mochida GH | title = Genetics and biology of microcephaly and lissencephaly | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Neurology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 120–6 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19778709 | pmc = 3565221 | doi = 10.1016/j.spen.2009.07.001 }}</ref>

The lack of gyri causing a smooth appearance of the cerebral cortex is due to abnormal neuronal migration in the developmental stages of the nervous system. The cause of lissencephaly has been linked to both genetic and non-genetic factors.<ref name="NORD">{{cite web |url= https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lissencephaly/#references|title= Lissencephaly |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2018|website= National Organisation for Rare Diseases (NORD)|publisher= NORD Rare Disease Database |access-date= 20 May 2018}}</ref> Three main types of lissencephaly have been identified and although all types display the similar symptoms the pathogenesis of each type varies.<ref name="renamed_from_4_on_20190213233203"/>

The genes associated with lissencephaly are still being discovered; however, due to advances in genetics individual genes are being identified as the cause of lissencephaly.<ref name="renamed_from_5_on_20190213233203">{{cite book|pmid=22787614|year=2012|last1=Liu|first1=J.

The known genetic and viral causes are listed below:

====''LIS1''====
''LIS1'' (also known as ''PAFAH1B1'') is the most widely studied. ''LIS1'' is located on chromosome 17p13.3.<ref name="renamed_from_4_on_20190213233203"/> ''LIS1'' is integral in regulating the motor protein [[dynein]] which plays an important role in the movement of neuronal nuclei along microtubules.<ref name="NORD"/> The mutation or deletion involving ''LIS1'' is associated with both Isolated Lissencephaly syndrome and [[Miller–Dieker syndrome]].<ref name="renamed_from_8_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardoso C, Leventer RJ, Ward HL, Toyo-Oka K, Chung J, Gross A, Martin CL, Allanson J, Pilz DT, Olney AH, Mutchinick OM, Hirotsune S, Wynshaw-Boris A, Dobyns WB, Ledbetter DH | title = Refinement of a 400-kb critical region allows genotypic differentiation between isolated lissencephaly, Miller-Dieker syndrome, and other phenotypes secondary to deletions of 17p13.3 | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 918–30 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12621583 | pmc = 1180354 | doi = 10.1086/374320 }}</ref> Miller-Dieker syndrome, however, has additional deletions of adjacent genes on chromosome 17 causing facial and other congenital abnormalities and defects.<ref name="renamed_from_8_on_20190213233203"/> This mutation full or deletion of chromosome 17p13.3 leads to inadequate neuronal migration due to ''LIS1'' encoding for an enzyme that interacts with the microtubule protein dynein.<ref name="NORD"/> ''LIS1'' mutation or deletion is not inherited from a parent and thus recurrence is unlikely.<ref name="renamed_from_4_on_20190213233203"/>

A Chinese family with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and a mutation in this gene has been reported.<ref name=Shi2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shi CH, Zhang S, Yang ZH, Li YS, Liu YT, Li Z, Hu ZW, Xu YM | s2cid = 51967262 | title = Identification of a novel PAFAH1B1 missense mutation as a cause of mild lissencephaly with basal ganglia calcification | journal = Brain & Development | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30100227 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2018.07.009 }}</ref>

====''DCX''====

''DCX'' or [[doublecortin]] encodes for the doublecortin protein which is similar to LIS1 as it encodes a microtubule associated protein that is related to microtubule function and transport in developing neuronal processes.<ref name="renamed_from_5_on_20190213233203"/> ''DCX'' mutation causes the disorganisation of neocortical layering in the cerebral cortex leading to a reduced folding.<ref name="renamed_from_11_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deuel TA, Liu JS, Corbo JC, Yoo SY, Rorke-Adams LB, Walsh CA | s2cid = 15362872 | title = Genetic interactions between doublecortin and doublecortin-like kinase in neuronal migration and axon outgrowth | journal = Neuron | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16387638 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.038 | doi-access = free }}</ref> ''DCX'' is localised to the X chromosome and thus this mutation may be inherited however it still can appear randomly. As it is an X chromosome linked abnormality males who inherit the gene are more likely to be severely affected. Females who inherit the DCX mutation have a more mild version of the syndrome.<ref name="NORD"/>

====''ARX''====
The ''ARX'' gene encodes for the aristaless related homeobox genes which are active in the early embryonic development to control formation of many tissues and structure. ARX is involved in the development of the embryonic forebrain, migration and communication of neurons as well as migration and proliferation of interneurons.<ref name="renamed_from_6_on_20190213233203"/> As ARX is expressed in the ganglionic eminences and the neocortical ventricular zone it can affect both radial and tangential migration. Similar to ''DCX'', ''ARX'' is an X chromosome linked gene and is linked with other symptoms such as absence of portions of the brain, abnormal genitalia and severe epilepsy.<ref name="renamed_from_6_on_20190213233203"/>

====''RELN''====

[[Reelin]] (RELN) is an extracellular matrix glycoproteins that is secreted to help with the regulation of neuronal migration. Lack of RELN in mice has shown deficiencies in migrating neurons. In reported cases, lissencephaly caused by RELN deficiency has been more severe in anterior brain regions with a very small cerebellum.<ref name="renamed_from_12_on_20190213233203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishikawa S, Goto S, Yamada K, Hamasaki T, Ushio Y | title = Lack of Reelin causes malpositioning of nigral dopaminergic neurons: evidence from comparison of normal and Reln(rl) mutant mice | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 461 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–73 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12724835 | doi = 10.1002/cne.10610 | s2cid = 9944380 }}</ref>

=== Viral infection ===
Lissencephaly has been recorded to have been caused by viruses and insufficient blood supply to the developing fetal brain. [[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) is a herpes-related virus that can [[Congenital cytomegalovirus infection|cause congenital defects]].<ref name="renamed_from_7_on_20190213233203"/> CMV has a high affinity for the developing germinal matrix of the brain. The severity of the infection is proportional to the time in gestation that the fetus was infected. It is early infection that leads to lissencephaly.<ref name="renamed_from_7_on_20190213233203"/> This is because early infection disrupts the migration and development of neurons.<ref name="renamed_from_7_on_20190213233203"/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of lissencephaly is usually made at birth or soon after by [[ultrasound]],<ref name="pmid19260111">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aslan H, Gungorduk K, Yildirim D, Aslan O, Yildirim G, Ceylan Y | title = Prenatal diagnosis of lissencephaly: a case report | journal = Journal of Clinical Ultrasound | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–8 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19260111 | doi = 10.1002/jcu.20572 | s2cid = 27735448 }}</ref> [[computed tomography]] (CT), or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cordes M, Cordes I, Sander B, Sperner J, Hedde JP | title = Lissencephaly: diagnosis by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging | journal = European Journal of Radiology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–3 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3383858 }}</ref> However, these results should be interpreted cautiously since even experienced radiologists can misdiagnose [[polymicrogyria]], a different developmental malformation of the brain, as lissencephaly.

Before birth, complex ultrasounds performed routinely during pregnancy may indicate the presence of a cerebral abnormality, but this method of diagnosis should be complemented by other methods, such as genetic studies and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], and the examination is not recommended as part of routine ultrasound examinations, unless family medical history or other reasons for suspecting brain malformation are present. The earliest point during gestation when it is possible to observe abnormal development of the brain surface is approximately in week 20, although ultrasound examinations in week 25–30 are more common.<ref name="pmid16549605">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghai S, Fong KW, Toi A, Chitayat D, Pantazi S, Blaser S | title = Prenatal US and MR imaging findings of lissencephaly: review of fetal cerebral sulcal development | journal = Radiographics | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 389–405 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16549605 | doi = 10.1148/rg.262055059 | doi-access =  }}</ref> Up to this time, the fetal brain normally has a smooth appearance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorovini-Zis K, Dolman CL | title = Gestational development of brain | journal = Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine | volume = 101 | issue = 4 | pages = 192–5 | date = April 1977 | pmid = 576786 }}</ref> If lissencephaly is suspected, [[chorionic villus sampling]] can test for some lissencephaly variants, but only those with a known genetic mutation.

===Classification===
The spectrum of lissencephaly is only now becoming more defined as neuroimaging and [[genetics]] have provided more insights into migration disorders. There are around 20 types of lissencephaly that make up the spectrum. Other causes which have not yet been identified are likely as well.

Different systems for classifying lissencephaly exist. One major distinction is "classic" (type I) vs. "cobblestone" (type II),<ref name="pmid16215456">{{cite journal | vauthors = Forman MS, Squier W, Dobyns WB, Golden JA | title = Genotypically defined lissencephalies show distinct pathologies | journal = Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | pages = 847–57 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16215456 | doi = 10.1097/01.jnen.0000182978.56612.41 | doi-access = free }}</ref> but some systems add additional forms that fit into neither of these categories.

==Treatment==
Treatment for those with lissencephaly is symptomatic and depends on the severity and locations of the brain malformations. Treatment is tailored towards the symptoms of the individual. Therapies for lissencephaly are to deal with the symptoms as the syndrome is congenital. Supportive care may be needed to help with comfort and nursing needs. Seizures may be controlled with medication and hydrocephalus may require shunting. If feeding becomes difficult, a [[gastrostomy]] tube may be considered.

There are a number of organisations that raise awareness and funding for rare disabilities such as lissencephaly. They also seek to increase the quality of life for individuals living with related disabilities. In the United States, these organizations include [[Arc of the United States]], [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], and [[March of Dimes]].

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for children with lissencephaly varies depending on the malformation and severity of the syndrome. Many individuals remain at a 3–5 month developmental level. Life expectancy is short and many children with lissencephaly will die before the age of 10. Some children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially. Aspiration and respiratory disease are the most common causes of illness or death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Lisa |title=Lissencephaly |url=http://www.specialchild.com/archives/dz-015.html |publisher=The Resource Foundation for Children with Challenges |access-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602032250/http://www.specialchild.com/archives/dz-015.html |archive-date= 2 June 2013 }}</ref> In the past, life expectancy was said to be around two years of age. However, with advances in seizure control, and treatments for respiratory illness, most children affected can live well beyond that age. With other advances in therapy and the broader availability of services and equipment, some children with lissencephaly are able to walk with varying degrees of assistance and to perform other functions once thought too advanced.
