The '''Norwegian Lundehund''' (Norwegian: ''Norsk lundehund'') is a small [[dog breed]] of the [[Spitz]] type that originates from [[Norway]]. Its name is a [[compound noun]] composed of the elements ''lunde'', meaning [[puffin]] (Norwegian ''lunde'', "puffin", or ''lundefugl'', "puffin bird"), and ''hund'', meaning dog. The breed was originally developed for the hunting of puffins and their eggs on inaccessible nesting places in caves and on cliffs.  The breed was at the brink of extinction in the 1960s and preservation efforts have since been underway.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Readicker-Henderson |first=Edward |date=2012-10-01 |title=Norway's Best-Kept Secret: Puffin Dogs |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/norways-best-kept-secret-puffin-dogs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709182347/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/norways-best-kept-secret-puffin-dogs |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |access-date=2022-08-14 |website=National Geographic |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The Lundehund was a valuable working animal for hunting puffin birds along the Norwegian coast as food for over 400 years.<ref>[http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/265g05-en.pdf FCI breed standard]</ref> The first known written record of the breed dates to 1591, when a bailiff wrote of his visit to Værøy that, “one cannot easily retrieve [puffins] from the depth without having a small dog accustomed to crawling into the hole and pulling the birds out.”<ref name=":2" /> Its flexibility and extra toes were ideal for hunting the birds in their inaccessible nesting locations on cliffs and in caves. Interest for the breed declined when new methods of using nets for hunting puffins were incorporated and a dog tax was created. Around 1900, they were only found in the isolated village of [[Mostad]] (spelled Måstad in Norwegian), [[Lofoten]]. There have also been stories of Lundehund being used on [[Lovund|Lovund, Lurøy]] by [[Petter Dass]], as cited in his famous work, [[Nordlands Trompet]]. The breed was nearly extinct around World War II when [[canine distemper]] struck [[Værøy]] and the surrounding islands, reducing the population to just two dogs.<ref name=":2" />  In 1963, the population was further decimated by another outbreak of distemper.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kropatsch |first1=Regina |last2=Melis |first2=Claudia |last3=Stronen |first3=Astrid V. |last4=Jensen |first4=Henrik |last5=Eppelen |first5=Joerg T. |date=2015 |title=Molecular Genetics of Sex Identification, Breed Ancestry and Polydactyly in the Norwegian Lundehund Breed |url=https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2462901 |journal= Journal of Heredity|volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=403–406 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esv031 |pmid=25994807 |issn=0022-1503|hdl=11250/2462901 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> This time, only six dogs survived, one on Værøy and five in eastern Norway, [[Hamar]], of which the latter five were from the same mother.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Lundehund-labb.JPG|thumb|left|The Lundehund has six toes, this helps it to cling on to the cliffs where it was bred.]]

The Norwegian Lundehund is a small, rectangular Spitz type dog with several unique phenotypical traits.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" /> They have a great range of motion in its joints, allowing it to fit into and extricate itself from narrow passages and tunnels.  Dogs of this breed are able to bend their head backwards along their own spine, similar to [[New Guinea singing dog]], Bornean dingo and [[Australian dingo]], and turn their forelegs to the side at a 90-degree horizontal angle to their body, much like human arms. Their pricked, upright ears can be folded shut to form a near-tight seal by folding forward or backward, protecting them from dirt and parasites.<ref name=":0" />

The Norwegian Lundehund is a [[Polydactyly|polydactyl]]: instead of the normal four toes per foot, the Lundehund normally has six toes, all fully formed, jointed and muscled.<ref name=":0" /> Some specimens may on occasion have more or fewer than six toes per foot, but this is then outside the breed standard. 
[[File:Lundehund 2008.jpg|thumb|Norwegian Lundehund]]
The outercoat is dense and rough with a soft undercoat. The Lundehund is adapted to climb narrow cliff paths in [[Værøy]] where it originally would have hunted puffins. Some general information can be found on the Norwegian Lundehund Association webpages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lundehund.no/filer/brosjyre/engelsk.pdf |title=General Brochure in English on Lundehund.pdf }}</ref> 

The breed is being tested in Tromsø airport by the Norwegian Air Traffic and Airport Management as a solution to airplane bird strikes. The dog is used to search for bird eggs around the airport for disposal. The Lundehound is an active breed that requires a fair amount of exercise. It is a good family dog, and does tolerate children well, if it is well socialized. 

== Health ==
The Norwegian Lundehund population shows signs of inbreeding depression including reduced fertility due to small litter size, inbreeding avoidance behaviors and low sperm quality.<ref name=":0" /> 

=== Lundehund syndrome ===
Norwegian Lundehund are predisposed to develop intestinal lymphangiectasia, commonly known as Lundehund Syndrome, a protein-wasting enteropathy that causes intermittent diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss and ascites.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Metzger |first1=Julia |last2=Pfahler |first2=Sophia |last3=Distl |first3=Ottmar |date=2016-08-02 |title=Variant detection and runs of homozygosity in next generation sequencing data elucidate the genetic background of Lundehund syndrome |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=535 |doi=10.1186/s12864-016-2844-6 |pmid=27485430 |pmc=4971756 |issn=1471-2164 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In addition, dogs with Lundehund Syndrome are predisposed to chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric neoplasms.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kolbjørnsen |first1=Ø. |last2=Press |first2=C.

There is no cure, though the disease can be managed; however, many dogs experience repeated acute episodes of Lundehund Syndrome throughout their lives, resulting in extensive medical treatment and poor quality of life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Berghoff, DVM |first=Nora |title=Lundehund Syndrome: What we know about chronic gastrointestinal disease in Norwegian Lundehunds |url=http://www.dcnh.de/cms/images/stories/Dokumente/lundehundsyndrome-whatweknow2006.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524095725/http://www.dcnh.de/cms/images/stories/Dokumente/lundehundsyndrome-whatweknow2006.pdf |archive-date=May 24, 2011 |access-date=April 13, 2011 |publisher=Texas A&M University }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nlaainc.com/health.htm |title=health |publisher=Nlaainc.com |access-date=April 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714185537/http://www.nlaainc.com/health.htm |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are indications that for the Lundehund to go on a low fat and higher protein diet has very positive effects on the health with respect to digestive problems.  A study on mortality in the Lundehund population showed that 30% of deaths before 11 years of age occurred as a consequence of Lundehund Syndrome and another 10% of other gastrointestinal diseases.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Rasespesifikk Avlsstrategi (RAS) for Norsk Lundehund |publisher=Norwegian Lundehund Club |year=2014 |location=Oslo |pages=28 |language=No |trans-title=Breed Specific Breeding Strategy for Norwegian Lundehund}}</ref> The genes responsible and pattern of inheritance for Lundehund Syndrome is not well understood and might, at least in part, be explained by polygenic inheritance and a high frequency—or fixation—of the responsible gene(s).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

=== Cross-breeding Program ===
Due to the severity of population bottlenecking, the Norwegian Lundehund is now undergoing a cross-breeding program spearheaded by the Norwegian Lundehund club with assistance from a group of geneticists. The program aims to employ a strategy of breeding the Norwegian Lundehund with select individuals from various other Nordic dog breeds including the [[Norwegian Buhund]], [[Icelandic Sheepdog]] and [[Norrbottenspets]] in order to reduce deleterious recessive genetic disorders.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beuchat |first1=Carol |title=Saving the Norwegian Lundehund: an update from Milo |url=https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/saving-the-lundehund-an-update-from-milo |website=Institute of Canine Biology |access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" />
