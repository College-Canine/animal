<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Aspiration pneumonia''' is a type of [[pneumonia|lung infection]] that is due to a relatively large amount of material from the stomach or mouth entering the lungs.<ref name=Di2015/> Signs and symptoms often include [[fever]] and [[cough]] of relatively rapid onset.<ref name=Di2015/> Complications may include [[lung abscess]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[empyema]], and [[parapneumonic effusion]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanivarapu |first1=Raghavendra R. |last2=Gibson |first2=Joshua |title=StatPearls |date=2023 |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |id={{NCBIBook2|NBK470459}} |chapter=Aspiration Pneumonia }}</ref><ref name=Di2015/> Some include [[chemical pneumonitis|chemical induced inflammation of the lungs]] as a subtype, which occurs from [[acidic]] but non-infectious stomach contents entering the lungs.<ref name=Di2015/><ref name=Fer2018/>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Infection can be due to a variety of [[bacteria]].<ref name=Fer2018/> Risk factors include [[decreased level of consciousness]], [[dysphagia|problems with swallowing]], [[alcoholism]], [[enteral feeding|tube feeding]], and poor [[oral health]].<ref name=Di2015/> Diagnosis is typically based on the presenting history, symptoms, [[chest X-ray]], and [[sputum culture]].<ref name=Di2015/><ref name=Fer2018/> Differentiating from other types of [[pneumonia]] may be difficult.<ref name="Di2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = DiBardino DM, Wunderink RG | title = Aspiration pneumonia: a review of modern trends | journal = Journal of Critical Care | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–8 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25129577 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrc.2014.07.011 }}</ref>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
Treatment is typically with [[antibiotics]] such as [[clindamycin]], [[meropenem]], [[ampicillin/sulbactam]], or [[moxifloxacin]].<ref name=Di2015/> For those with only chemical pneumonitis, antibiotics are not typically required.<ref name=Fer2018/> Among people hospitalized with pneumonia, about 10% are due to aspiration.<ref name=Di2015/> It occurs more often in older people, especially those in [[nursing home]]s.<ref name="Fer2018">{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F |chapter=Pneumonia, Aspiration |page=1006 |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor |date=2017 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-323-52957-0 |chapter-url={{Google books|wGclDwAAQBAJ|page=1006|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref> Both sexes are equally affected.<ref name=Fer2018/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The person may have an insidious course with increased respiratory rate, foul-smelling sputum, hemoptysis, and fever.  Complications may occur, such as exudative pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscesses.<ref name=Review/> If left untreated, aspiration pneumonia can progress to form a [[lung abscess]].{{sfn|Kemp|Burns|Brown|2007|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} Another possible complication is an [[empyema]], in which pus collects inside the lungs.{{sfn|Deterding|Hay|Levin|Abzug|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} If continual aspiration occurs, the chronic inflammation can cause compensatory thickening of the insides of the lungs, resulting in [[bronchiectasis]].{{sfn|Deterding|Hay|Levin|Abzug|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}}

==Causes==
Most aspiration events occur in patients with a defective [[swallowing]] mechanism, such as a neurological disease or as the result of an injury that directly impairs swallowing or interferes with consciousness.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12405619 |date=2002 |last1=Delegge |first1=M. H. |title=Aspiration pneumonia: Incidence, mortality, and at-risk populations |journal=Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition |volume=26 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=S19-24; discussion S24-5 |doi=10.1177/014860710202600604 }}</ref> Impaired consciousness can be intentional, such as the use of general anesthesia for surgery. For many types of surgical [[Surgery|operation]]s, people preparing for surgery are therefore instructed to take nothing by mouth ([[nil per os]], abbreviated as NPO) for at least four hours before surgery. These conditions enable the entry of bacteria into the lungs, thus allowing the development of an infection.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Risk factors===
* Impaired swallowing: Conditions that cause [[dysphagia]] worsen the ability of people to swallow, causing an increased risk of entry of particles from the stomach or mouth into the airways. While swallowing dysfunction is associated with aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia may not be sufficient unless other risk factors are present.<ref name=Review/>  Neurologic conditions that can directly impact the nerves involved in the swallow mechanism include [[stroke]], [[neurodegenerative diseases]] (such as [[Parkinson's disease]]), and [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="Di2015" /> Anatomical changes in the chest can also disrupt the swallow mechanism.<ref name="Di2015" /> For example, patients with advanced [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] tend to develop enlarged lungs, resulting in compression of the [[esophagus]] and thus regurgitation.<ref name="Di2015" />
* [[Altered level of consciousness|Altered mental status]]: Changes in levels of consciousness affect the swallow mechanism by both disabling the body's natural protective measures against aspiration as well as possibly causing nausea and vomiting.<ref name="Di2015" /> Altered mental status can be caused by medical conditions such as [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]].<ref name="Di2015" /> However, many other agents can be responsible as well, including [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] and alcohol.<ref name="Di2015" />
* Bacterial colonization: Poor oral hygiene can result in colonization of the mouth with excessive amounts of bacteria, which is linked to increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia.<ref name="Di2015" /> 
* Ethnicity: Asians diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia have a lower risk of death compared to other ethnic groups while African Americans and whites share a relatively similar risk of death. Hispanics have a lower risk of death than non-Hispanics.<ref name="Oliver_2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliver MN, Stukenborg GJ, Wagner DP, Harrell FE, Kilbridge KL, Lyman JA, Einbinder J, Connors AF | title = Comorbid disease and the effect of race and ethnicity on in-hospital mortality from aspiration pneumonia | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 96 | issue = 11 | pages = 1462–9 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15586650 | pmc = 2568617 }}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
Aspiration is defined as inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the pulmonary tree.  Depending on the composition of the aspirate, three complications have been described:<ref name="Review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luk JK, Chan DK | title = Preventing aspiration pneumonia in older people: do we have the 'know-how'?| journal = Hong Kong Med J | volume = 20 | issue = 5 |pages = 421–7 | date = Jul 2014 | doi = 10.12809/hkmj144251 | pmid = 24993858| doi-access = free }}</ref>
* Chemical pneumonitis may develop whose severity depends on the pH value and quantity of aspirate.  The two lung changes after acid aspiration are:  a) direct toxic damage to the respiratory epithelium resulting in interstitial pulmonary edema and b) a few hours later, inflammatory response with production of cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and macrophage activation.  Oxygen-free radicals are generated which, in turn, lead to further lung damage. Patients may remain asymptomatic after acid aspiration. Others may develop dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever, bloody or frothy sputum, and respiratory failure. 
* Aspiration pneumonia may develop.  
* The third complication occurs after inhalation of particulate matter that obstructs airways. The patients will have sudden arterial hypoxemia with development of lung atelectasis.

===Location===
The location is often gravity dependent, and depends on the person's position. Generally, the right middle and lower [[lung lobes]] are the most common sites affected, due to the larger caliber and more vertical orientation of the right mainstem bronchus. People who [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirate]] while standing can have bilateral lower lung lobe infiltrates. The right upper lobe is a common area of consolidation, where liquids accumulate in a particular region of the lung, in alcoholics who aspirate in the supine position.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|296198|Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:AspirationPneumonia.png|thumb|Aspiration pneumonia in a ventilated person with a central line and nasogastric tube]]
Evaluation of aspiration is generally performed with a video fluoroscopic swallowing study involving radiologic evaluation of the swallowing mechanism via challenges with liquid and solid food consistencies. These studies allow for evaluation of penetration to the vocal folds and below but are not a sensitive and specific marker for aspiration.<ref name="History"/> Additionally, it is difficult to distinguish between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.<ref name="Characteristics">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lanspa M, Peyrani P, Wiemkwn T, Wilson E, Ramirez J, Dean N | title = Characteristics associated with clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia; a descriptive study of afflicted patients and their outcomes | journal = J Hosp Med | volume = 10 | issue = 2 |pages = 90–6 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1002/jhm.2280 | pmid = 25363892 | pmc = 4310822 }}</ref>

Aspiration pneumonia is typically diagnosed by a combination of clinical circumstances (people with risk factors for aspiration) and radiologic findings (an infiltrate in the proper location).<ref name=Di2015/> A [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] is typically performed in cases where any pneumonia is suspected, including aspiration pneumonia.{{sfn|McKean|Ross|Dressler|Scheurer|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} Findings on chest x-ray supportive of aspiration pneumonia include localized consolidation depending on the patient's position when the aspiration occurred.{{sfn|McKean|Ross|Dressler|Scheurer|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} For example, people that are [[Supine position|supine]] when they aspirate often develop consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung.{{sfn|McKean|Ross|Dressler|Scheurer|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} [[Sputum culture]]s are not used for diagnosing aspiration pneumonia because of the high risk of contamination.{{sfn|Kasper|Jameson|Hauser|Loscalzo|2015|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} Clinical symptoms may also increase suspicion of aspiration pneumonia, including new difficulty breathing and fever after an aspiration event.{{sfn|Deterding|Hay|Levin|Abzug|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} Likewise, physical exam findings such as altered breath sounds heard in the affected lung fields may also be suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.{{sfn|Deterding|Hay|Levin|Abzug|2016|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} Some cases of aspiration pneumonia are caused by aspiration of food particles or other particulate substances like pill fragments; these can be diagnosed by pathologists on [[lung biopsy]] specimens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukhopadhyay S, Katzenstein AL | title = Pulmonary disease due to aspiration of food and other particulate matter: a clinicopathologic study of 59 cases diagnosed on biopsy or resection specimens | journal = The American Journal of Surgical Pathology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 752–9 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17460460 | doi = 10.1097/01.pas.0000213418.08009.f9 | s2cid = 45207101 }}</ref>

While aspiration pneumonia and [[chemical pneumonitis]] may appear similar, it is important to differentiate between the two due to major differences in management of these conditions. Chemical pneumonitis is caused by damage to the inner layer of lung tissue, which triggers an influx of fluid.{{sfn|Kasper|Jameson|Hauser|Loscalzo|2015|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} The inflammation caused by this reaction can rapidly cause similar findings seen in aspiration pneumonia, such as an elevated WBC ([[white blood cell]]) count, radiologic findings, and fever.{{sfn|Kasper|Jameson|Hauser|Loscalzo|2015|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} However, it is important to note that the findings of chemical pneumonitis are triggered by inflammation not caused by infection, as seen in aspiration pneumonia. Inflammation is the body's immune response to any perceived threat to the body. Thus, treatment of chemical pneumonitis typically involves removal of the inflammatory fluid and supportive measures, notably excluding antibiotics.{{sfn|Fishman|Kotloff|Grippi|Pack|2015|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}} The use of antimicrobials is reserved for chemical pneumonitis complicated by secondary bacterial infection.{{sfn|Kasper|Jameson|Hauser|Loscalzo|2015|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}}

== Prevention ==
There have been several practices associated with decreased incidence and decreased severity of aspiration pneumonia as detailed below.

=== Oral hygiene ===
Studies showed that the net reduction of oral bacteria was associated with a decrease in both incidence of aspiration pneumonia as well as mortality from aspiration pneumonia.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tada A, Miura H | title = Prevention of aspiration pneumonia (AP) with oral care | journal = Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–21 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 21764148 | doi = 10.1016/j.archger.2011.06.029 }}</ref> One broad method of decreasing the number of bacteria in the mouth involves the use of antimicrobials, ranging from [[Topical medication|topical]] antibiotics to [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] antibiotic use.<ref name=":3" /> Whereas the use of antibiotics focuses on destroying and hindering the growth of bacteria, mechanical removal of oral bacteria by a dental professional also plays a key role in reducing the bacterial burden.<ref name=":3" /> By reducing the amount of bacteria in the mouth, the likelihood of infection when aspiration occurs is reduced as well.<ref name=":3" /> For people who are critically ill that require a feeding tube, there is evidence suggesting that the risk of aspiration pneumonia may be reduced by inserting the feeding tube into the duodenum or the jejunum (post-pyloric feeding), when compared to inserting the feeding tube [[Gastric feeding tube|into the stomach]].<ref name="Alkhawaja2015" />

=== Enhanced swallow ===
Many people at risk for aspiration pneumonia have an impaired swallowing mechanism, which may increase the chance of aspiration of food particles with meals.<ref name=":3" /> There is some evidence to indicate that training of various parts of the body involved in the act of swallowing, including the tongue and lips, may reduce episodes of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia; however, further research is required to confirm this benefit.<ref name=":3" /> Other simple actions during feeding can improve the swallowing capability of a person and thus reduce the risk of aspiration, including changes in position and feeding assistance.{{sfn|Conant|Williams|Chen|Landefeld|2014|p={{page needed|date=August 2023}}}}

=== After surgery ===
Many instances of aspiration occur during surgical operations, especially during [[anesthesia]] induction.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nason KS | title = Acute Intraoperative Pulmonary Aspiration | journal = Thoracic Surgery Clinics | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–7 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26210926 | pmc = 4517287 | doi = 10.1016/j.thorsurg.2015.04.011 }}</ref> The administration of anesthesia causes suppression of protective reflexes, most importantly the gag reflex. As a result, stomach particles can easily enter the lungs. Certain risk factors predispose individuals to aspiration, especially conditions causing dysfunction of the upper gastrointestinal system.<ref name=":4" /> Identifying these conditions before the operation begins is essential for proper preparation during the procedure.<ref name=":4" /> It is recommended that patients fast prior to procedures as well.<ref name=":4" /> Other practices that may be beneficial but have not been well-studied include medication that reduce the acidity of gastric contents and [[rapid sequence induction]].<ref name=":4" />  On the other hand, regarding reducing acidity of the stomach, an acid environment is needed to kill the organisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract; agents, such as proton pump inhibitors, that decrease the acidity of the stomach, may favor the growth of bacteria and increase the risk of pneumonia.<ref name = Review/>

== Treatment ==
Adjusting the patient's posture should come first, then the oropharyngeal contents should be suctioned with the nasogastric tube in place. Humidified oxygen is given to patients who are not intubated, and the head end of the bed should be elevated by 45 degrees. It's crucial to keep a close eye on the patient's oxygen saturation, and if hypoxia is detected, urgent intubation with mechanical breathing should be given. Flexible bronchoscopy is often used to gather samples of bronchoalveolar lavage for quantitative bacteriological tests as well as high volume aspiration to clear the secretion.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=28879323|pmc=5564131 |date=2017 |last1=Son |first1=Y.

== Prognosis ==
Dysphagia clinicians often recommend alteration of dietary regimens, altered head positioning, or removal of all oral intake.  While studies have suggested that thickening liquids can decrease aspiration through slowed pharyngeal transit time, they have also demonstrated increased pharyngeal residues with risk for delayed aspiration.  The ability of clinical interventions to reduce pneumonia incidence is relatively unknown.  Dietary modifications or nothing-by-mouth status also have no effect on a patient's ability to handle their own secretions. A patient's individual vigor may impact the development of pulmonary infections more than aspiration.  Also increased pneumonia risk exists in patients with esophageal dysphagia when compared to stroke patients because patients with stroke will improve as they recover from their acute injury, whereas esophageal dysphagia is likely to worsen with time.  In one cohort of aspiration pneumonia patients, overall three-year mortality was 40%.<ref name="History">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bock M, Varadarajan V, Brawley M, Blumin J | title = Evaluation of the Natural History of Patients Who Aspirate | journal = Laryngoscope | volume = 127 | issue = 8 |pages = S1–S10 | date = 2017 | doi = 10.1002/lary.26854 | pmid = 28884823 | pmc = 5788193 }}</ref>

Studies have shown that aspiration pneumonia has been associated with an overall increased in-hospital mortality as compared with other forms of pneumonia.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Komiya K, Rubin BK, Kadota JI, Mukae H, Akaba T, Moro H, Aoki N, Tsukada H, Noguchi S, Shime N, Takahashi O, Kohno S | title = Prognostic implications of aspiration pneumonia in patients with community acquired pneumonia: A systematic review with meta-analysis | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 38097 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27924871 | pmc = 5141412 | doi = 10.1038/srep38097 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...638097K }}</ref> Further studies investigating differing time spans including 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, and 1-year mortality.<ref name=":6" /> Individuals diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia were also at increased risk of developing future episodes of pneumonia. In fact, these individuals were also found to be at higher risk for readmission after being discharged from the hospital.<ref name=":6" /> Lastly, one study found that individuals diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia were more likely to fail treatment compared to other types of pneumonia.<ref name=":6" />

==Elderly==
Aging increases the risk of dysphagia. The prevalence of dysphagia in nursing homes is approximately 50%, and 30% of the elderly with dysphagia develop aspiration.  For individuals older than 75, the risk of pneumonia due to dysphagia is six times greater than those 65.<ref name="ElderlyProtocol">{{cite journal | last1 = Hansjee | first1 = Djaromee | title = An Acute Model of Care to Guide Eating & Drinking Decisions in the Frail Elderly with Dementia and Dysphagia | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 65 | date = 2018 | doi = 10.3390/geriatrics3040065 | pmid = 31011100 | pmc = 6371181 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Owing to multiple factors, such as frailty, impaired efficacy of swallowing, decreased cough reflex and neurological complications, dysphagia can be considered as a geriatric syndrome.<ref name="Chlorhexidine">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollaar V, Putten G, Maarel-Wierink C, Bronkhorst E, Swart B, Creugers N  | title = The effect of a daily application of a 0.05% chlorhexidine oral rinse solution on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents: a multicenter study | journal = BMC Geriatrics | volume = 17 | issue = 128 |pages = 128 | date = 2017 | doi = 10.1186/s12877-017-0519-z| pmid = 28629318 | pmc = 5477106 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Atypical presentation is common in the elderly.  Older patients may have impaired T cell function and hence, they may be unable to mount a febrile response. The mucociliary clearance of older people is also impaired, resulting in diminished sputum production and cough. Therefore, they can present non-specifically with different geriatric syndromes.<ref name="Review"/>

===Microaspirations===
In the elderly, dysphagia is a significant risk factor for the development of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia most often develops due to micro-aspiration of saliva, or bacteria carried on food and liquids, in combination with impaired host immune function.<ref name="Aging">{{cite journal | last1 = Cichero | first1 = Julie | title = Age-Related Changes to Eating and Swallowing Impact Frailty: Aspiration, Choking Risk, Modified Food Texture and Autonomy of Choice | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 3 | issue = 4 |pages = 69–79 | date = 2018 | doi = 10.3390/geriatrics3040069 | pmid = 31011104 | doi-access = free | pmc = 6371116 }}</ref>
Chronic inflammation of the lungs is a key feature in aspiration pneumonia in elderly nursing home residents and presents as a sporadic fever (one day per week for several months). Radiological review shows chronic inflammation in the consolidated lung tissue, linking chronic micro-aspiration and chronic lung inflammation.

===Choking===
After falls, choking on food presents as the second highest cause of preventable death in aged care.<ref name = Aging/> Although food choking risk is commonly associated with young children, data shows that individuals over 65 years of age have a choking incidence that is seven times higher than children aged 1–4 years.<ref name="Aging" />

===Parkinson's disease===
The reported prevalence of dysphagia in patients with Parkinson's disease ranges from 20% to 100% due to variations in the methods of assessing the swallowing function.<ref name="Parkinson">{{cite journal | vauthors = Umemoto G, Furuya H | title = Management of Dysphagia in Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Related Disorders | journal = Intern Med | date = 2019 | pmid = 30996170 |doi =  10.2169/internalmedicine.2373-18 | doi-access = free | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pmc = 6995701 | pages = 7–14 }}</ref>  Unlike some medical problems, such as stroke, dysphagia in Parkinson's Disease degenerates with disease progression. Aspiration pneumonia was the most common reason for the emergency admission of patients with Parkinson's Disease whose disease duration was >5 years and pneumonia was one of the main causes of death.

===Dementia===
The familiar model of care for people with advanced dementia and dysphagia is the revolving door of recurrent chest infections, frequently associated with aspiration and related readmissions.  Many individuals with dementia resist or are indifferent to food and fail to manage the food bolus.  There are also many contributory factors such as poor oral hygiene, high dependency levels for being positioned and fed, as well as the need for oral suctioning.  While tube feeding might therefore be considered a safer option, tube feeding has not been shown to be beneficial in people with advanced dementia.  The preferred option therefore is to continue eating and drinking orally despite the risk of developing chest infections.<ref name=ElderlyProtocol />
