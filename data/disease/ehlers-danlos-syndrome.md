== Types ==
In 2017, 13 subtypes of EDS were classified using specific diagnostic criteria.<ref name="GARD2017"/> According to the [[Ehlers–Danlos Society]], the syndromes can also be grouped by the symptoms determined by specific gene mutations. Group A disorders are those that affect primary collagen structure and processing. Group B disorders affect collagen folding and crosslinking. Group C are disorders of structure and function of myomatrix. Group D disorders are those that affect [[glycosaminoglycan]] biosynthesis. Group E disorders are characterized by defects in the complement pathway. Group F are disorders of intracellular processes, and Group G is considered to be unresolved forms of EDS.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/|title=The Types of EDS|website=The Ehlers Danlos Society|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>

===Hypermobile EDS (hEDS)===
Hypermobile EDS (hEDS, formerly categorized as type 3) is mainly characterized by hypermobility that affects both large and small joints. It may lead to frequent joint [[subluxations]] (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, and may have chronic muscle and/or bone pain.<ref name="GARD2017"/> It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test.<ref name="Levy_2018"/> hEDS is the most common of the 19 types of connective tissue disorders. Since no genetic test exists, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they know about the condition and the patient's physical attributes. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/hypermobile-eds-and-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Hypermobile EDS and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders| vauthors = Carter K | work = Ehlers–Danlos Support UK}}</ref>

Pregnant individuals who have hEDS are at an increased risk for complications. Some possible complications are pre-labor rupture of membranes, a drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitate birth (very fast, active labor), malposition of the fetus, and increased bleeding. Individuals with hEDS may run the risk of falling, [[postpartum depression]] (more than the general population), and slow healing from the birthing process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/pregnancy-birth-feeding-and-hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Pregnancy, birth, feeding, and hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders | work = The Ehlers–Danlos Support UK|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>

The Medical University of South Carolina discovered a gene variant common with hEDS patients.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Cantu L | date = 14 July 2021 |title=MUSC researchers announce gene mutation discovery associated with EDS |url=https://web.musc.edu/about/news-center/2021/07/14/musc-researchers-announce-gene-mutation-discovery-associated-with-eds-ehlers-danlos |access-date=2023-02-08 | work = Medical University of South Carolina}}</ref>

==== Genetics of hypermobile EDS====

While 12 of the 13 subtypes of EDS have genetic variations that can be tested for by [[genetic testing]], there is no known genetic cause of hEDS. Recently, several labs and research initiatives have been attempting to uncover a potential hEDS gene. In 2018, the [[Ehlers–Danlos Society]] began the Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos Genetic Evaluation (HEDGE) study.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/hedge/|title=HEDGE Study| website= ehlers-danlos.com| publisher= | date= | access-date=}}</ref> The ongoing study has screened over 1,000 people who have been diagnosed with hEDS by the 2017 criteria to evaluate their genome for a common mutation. To date, 200 people with hEDS have had [[whole genome sequencing]], and 500 have had whole [[Exome sequencing|exome]] sequencing; this study aims to increase those numbers significantly.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Promising outcomes of this increased screening have been reported by the Norris Lab, led by Russell Norris, in the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology at [[Medical University of South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thenorrislab.com/home|title= About the Lab| publisher= Norris Lab, [[Medical University of South Carolina]]| date= | access-date=}}</ref> Using [[CRISPR]] Cas-9 mediated genome editing on mouse models of the disease, the lab has recently identified a "very strong candidate gene"<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gensemer C, Burks R, Kautz S, Judge DP, Lavallee M, Norris RA | title = Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndromes: Complex phenotypes, challenging diagnoses, and poorly understood causes | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 250 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–344 | date = March 2021 | pmid = 32629534 | pmc = 7785693 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.220}}</ref> for hEDS. This finding, and a greater understanding of cardiac complications associated with the majority of EDS subtypes, has led to the development of multiple druggable pathways involved in [[Aorta|aortic]] and [[mitral valve]] diseases. While this candidate gene has not been publicly identified, the Norris lab has conducted several studies involving small population genome sequencing and come up with a working list of possible hEDS genes. A mutation in [[Collagen, type III, alpha 1|''COL3A1'']]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Narcisi P, Richards AJ, Ferguson SD, Pope FM | title = A family with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type III/articular hypermobility syndrome has a glycine 637 to serine substitution in type III collagen | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 1617–1620 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 7833919 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/3.9.1617}}</ref> in a single family with autosomal dominant hEDS phenotype was found to cause reduced collagen secretion and an over-modification of collagen. In 35 families, copy number alterations in ''[[TPSAB1]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons JJ, Yu X, Hughes JD, Le QT, Jamil A, Bai Y, Ho N, Zhao M, Liu Y, O'Connell MP, Trivedi NN, Nelson C, DiMaggio T, Jones N, Matthews H, Lewis KL, Oler AJ, Carlson RJ, Arkwright PD, Hong C, Agama S, Wilson TM, Tucker S, Zhang Y, McElwee JJ, Pao M, Glover SC, Rothenberg ME, Hohman RJ, Stone KD, Caughey GH, Heller T, Metcalfe DD, Biesecker LG, Schwartz LB, Milner JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Elevated basal serum tryptase identifies a multisystem disorder associated with increased TPSAB1 copy number | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 1564–1569 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27749843 | pmc = 5397297 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3696}}</ref> encoding alpha-tryptase, were associated with increased basal serum [[tryptase]] levels, associated with [[Dysautonomia|autonomic dysfunction]], [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal disorders]], allergic and cutaneous symptoms, and connective tissue abnormalities, all concurrent with hEDS phenotype. Lastly, [[Tenascin X]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo L, Beck T, Fulmer D, Ramos-Ortiz S, Glover J, Wang C, Moore K, Gensemer C, Morningstar J, Moore R, Schott JJ, Le Tourneau T, Koren N, Norris RA | display-authors = 6 | title = DZIP1 regulates mammalian cardiac valve development through a Cby1-β-catenin mechanism | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 250 | issue = 10 | pages = 1432–1449 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 33811421 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.342 | pmc = 8518365}}</ref> an [[extracellular matrix]] protein important for collagen mutation encoded by the ''[[TNXB]]'' gene, has been associated with hEDS in patients with Tenascin X deficiency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Another way the Norris lab is attempting to find this gene is by looking at genes involved in the formation of the aorta and mitral valves, as these valves are often prolapsed or malformed as a symptom of EDS. Because hEDS is such a complex, multi-organ disease, focusing on one hallmark trait has proven successful. One gene found this way is ''[[DZIP1]]'', which regulates cardiac valve development in mammals through a [[CBY1]]-beta-catenin mechanism. Mutations at this gene affect the [[Catenin beta-1|beta-catenin]] cascade involved in development, causing malformation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in loss of collagen. A lack of collagen here is both consistent with hEDS and explains the "floppy" mitral and aortic valve heart defects. A second genetic study specific to mitral valve prolapse focused on the [[Platelet-derived growth factor|PDGF]] signaling pathway, which is involved in growth factor ligands and receptor isoforms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore K, Fulmer D, Guo L, Koren N, Glover J, Moore R, Gensemer C, Beck T, Morningstar J, Stairley R, Norris RA | display-authors = 6 | title = PDGFRα: Expression and Function during Mitral Valve Morphogenesis | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | date = March 2021 | page = 28 | pmid = 33805717 | doi = 10.3390/jcdd8030028 | pmc = 7999759 | doi-access = free}}</ref> Mutations in this pathway affect the ability to localize [[cilia]] in various cell types, including cardiac cells. With the resulting [[ciliopathies]], structures such as the [[cardiac outflow tract]], [[heart tube]] assembly, and cardiac fusion are limited and/or damaged.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Classical EDS (cEDS)===
Classical EDS (formerly categorized as type 1) is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily and hypermobility of the joints. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified [[hematoma]]s that occur over pressure points) and spheroids (cysts that contain fat occurring over forearms and shins) are also often seen. A side complication of the hyperelasticity presented in many EDS cases makes wounds closing on their own more difficult.<ref name="Malfait_2018" /> Sometimes, motor development is delayed and [[hypotonia]] occurs.<ref name=GARD2017>{{cite web|title=Ehlers–Danlos syndromes | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health |url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6322/ehlers-danlos-syndromes |access-date=23 September 2017|date=20 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924001628/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6322/ehlers-danlos-syndromes|archive-date=24 September 2017}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The variation causing this type of EDS is in the genes ''[[COL5A2]], [[COL5A1]],'' and less frequently ''[[COL1A1]]''.

A good way to begin the diagnosis process is looking at family history. EDS is an autosomal dominant condition, so is often inherited from parents.<ref name="Malfait_2018" /> Genetic testing remains the most reliable way to diagnose EDS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakhmanov Y, Maltese PE, Bruson A, Castori M, Beccari T, Dundar M, Bertelli M |date=2018-09-01|title=Genetic testing for vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and other variants with fragility of the middle arteries|url=https://doaj.org/|journal=The EuroBiotech Journal|volume=2|issue=s1|pages=42–44|doi=10.2478/ebtj-2018-0034|s2cid=86589984|issn=2564-615X|doi-access=free}}</ref> No cure for type 1 EDS has been found, but a course of non-weight-bearing exercise can help with muscular tension, which can help correct some EDS symptoms. Anti-inflammatory drugs and lifestyle changes can help with joint pain. Lifestyle choices should also be made with children who have EDS to try to prevent wounds to the skin. Protective garments can help with this. In a wound, deep stitches are often used and left in place for longer than normal.<ref name="Malfait_2018" />

===Vascular EDS (vEDS)===
Vascular EDS (formerly categorized as type 4) is identified by skin that is thin, translucent, extremely fragile, and bruises easily. It is also characterized by fragile blood vessels and organs that can easily rupture. Affected people are frequently short, and have thin scalp hair. It also has characteristic facial features, including large eyes, an undersized chin, sunken cheeks, a thin nose and lips, and ears without lobes.<ref name="Eagleton2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eagleton MJ | title = Arterial complications of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages = 1869–1880 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27687326 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.06.120 | url = https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(16)30876-X/fulltext | doi-access = free}} {{open access}}</ref> Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include [[Clubfoot|club foot]], tendon and/or muscle rupture, [[acrogeria]] (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet), early-onset [[varicose veins]], [[pneumothorax]] (collapse of a lung), the recession of the gums, and a decreased amount of fat under the skin.<ref name="GARD2017" /> It can be caused by the variations in the ''[[COL3A1]]'' gene.<ref name="Eagleton2016" /> Rarely, ''[[COL1A1]]'' variations can also cause it.<ref name=":1"/>

===Kyphoscoliosis EDS (kEDS)===
Kyphoscoliosis EDS (formerly categorized as type 6) is associated with severe [[hypotonia]] at birth, delayed motor development, progressive [[scoliosis]] (present from birth), and scleral fragility. People may also have easy bruising, fragile arteries that are prone to rupture, unusually small corneas, and [[osteopenia]] (low bone density). Other common features include a "[[marfanoid]] habitus" characterized by long, slender fingers ([[arachnodactyly]]), unusually long limbs, and a sunken chest ([[pectus excavatum]]) or protruding chest ([[pectus carinatum]]).<ref name="GARD2017"/> It can be caused by variations in the gene ''[[PLOD1]]'', or rarely, in the ''[[FKBP14]]'' gene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2083/kyphoscoliotic-ehlers-danlos-syndrome|title=Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health |access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>

===Arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS)===
Arthrochalasia EDS (formerly categorized as types 7A and B) is characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital [[hip dislocation]]. Other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising, [[hypotonia]], [[kyphoscoliosis]] ([[kyphosis]] and [[scoliosis]]), and mild [[osteopenia]].<ref name="GARD2017"/> [[Type I collagen|Type-I collagen]] is usually affected. It is very rare, with about 30 cases reported. It is more severe than the hypermobility type.

===Dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS)===
Dermatosparaxis EDS (formerly categorized as type 7C) is associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; hypermobility ranging from mild to serious; and hernias. Variations in the ''[[ADAMTS2]]'' gene cause it. It is extremely rare, with around 11 cases reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2089/dermatosparaxis-ehlers-danlos-syndrome|title=Dermatosparaxis Ehlers–Danlos syndrome  | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health |access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>

===Brittle-cornea syndrome (BCS)===
Brittle-cornea syndrome is characterized by the progressive thinning of the [[cornea]], early-onset progressive [[keratoglobus]] or keratoconus, nearsightedness, hearing loss, and blue [[sclera]]e.<ref name=GARD2017/><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1019/brittle-cornea-syndrome|title=Brittle cornea syndrome | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health  |access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> Classic symptoms, such as hypermobile joints and hyperelastic skin, are also seen often.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.omim.org/entry/614170|title=OMIM Entry – # 614170 – Brittle Cornea Syndrome 2; BCS2|website=www.omim.org|access-date=2018-06-18}}</ref> It has two types. Type 1 occurs due to variations in the ''[[ZNF469]]'' gene. Type 2 is due to variations in the ''PRDM5'' gene.<ref name=":0"/>

===Classical-like EDS (clEDS)===
Classical-like EDS is characterized by skin hyperextensibility with velvety skin texture and absence of atrophic scarring, generalized joint hypermobility with or without recurrent dislocations (most often shoulder and ankle), and easily bruised skin or spontaneous [[ecchymoses]] (discolorations of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath).<ref name=GARD2017/> It can be caused by variations in the ''[[TNXB]]'' gene.<ref name=":1" />

===Spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS)===
Spondylodysplastic EDS is characterized by short stature (progressive in childhood), muscle [[hypotonia]] (ranging from severe congenital to mild later-onset), and bowing of limbs.<ref name=GARD2017/> It can be caused by variations in both copies of the ''[[B4GALT7]]'' gene. Other cases can be caused by variations in the ''B3GALT6'' gene. People with variations in this gene can have [[kyphoscoliosis]], tapered fingers, [[osteoporosis]], [[aortic aneurysm]]s, and problems with the lungs. Other cases can be caused by the ''SLC39A13'' gene. Those with variations in this gene have protuberant eyes, wrinkled palms of the hands, tapering fingers, and distal joint hypermobility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9991/spondylodysplastic-ehlers-danlos-syndrome/cases/31481#4870|title=Spondylodysplastic Ehlers–Danlos syndrome | work = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health  |access-date=2019-09-22|archive-date=2020-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708114805/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9991/spondylodysplastic-ehlers-danlos-syndrome/cases/31481#4870|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS)===
Musculocontractural EDS is characterized by congenital multiple contractures, characteristically adduction-flexion contractures and/or [[talipes equinovarus]] ([[clubfoot]]), characteristic craniofacial features, which are evident at birth or in early infancy, and skin features such as skin hyperextensibility, bruising, skin fragility with atrophic scars, and increased palmar wrinkling.<ref name=GARD2017/> It can be caused by variations in the ''[[CHST14]]'' gene. Some other cases can be caused by variations in the ''[[DSE (gene)|DSE]]'' gene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C1866294/|title=Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, musculocontractural type - Conditions – GTR – NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>

===Myopathic EDS (mEDS)===
[[Bethlem myopathy|Bethlem myopathy 2]], formally known as Myopathic EDS (mEDS), is characterized by three major criteria: congenital muscle [[hypotonia]] and/or [[muscle atrophy]] that improves with age, proximal joint contractures of the knee, hip, and elbow, and hypermobility of distal joints (ankles, wrists, feet, and hands).<ref name=GARD2017/> Four minor criteria may also contribute to a diagnosis of mEDS. This disorder can be inherited through either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern.<ref name=":2" /> Molecular testing must be completed to verify that mutations in the ''[[COL12A1]]'' gene are present; if not, other collagen-type myopathies should be considered.<ref name=":2" />

===Periodontal EDS (pEDS)===
Periodontal EDS (pEDS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder<ref name=":2" /> characterized by four major criteria of severe and intractable [[Periodontal disease|periodontitis]] of early-onset (childhood or adolescence), lack of attached [[Gums|gingiva]], pretibial plaques, and family history of a first-degree relative who meets clinical criteria.<ref name=GARD2017/> Eight minor criteria may also contribute to the diagnosis of pEDS. Molecular testing may reveal mutations in ''[[C1R]]'' or ''[[C1S]]'' genes affecting the [[C1r]] protein.<ref name=":2" />

===Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS)===
Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS) is characterized by three major criteria: severe progressive cardiac-valvular problems (affecting aortic and mitral valves), skin problems such as hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, thin skin, and easy bruising, and joint hypermobility (generalized or restricted to small joints).<ref name=GARD2017/> Four minor criteria may aid in diagnosis of cvEDS.<ref name=":2" /> cvEDS is an autosomal recessive disorder, inherited through variation in both [[allele]]s of the gene ''[[COL1A2]].''<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guarnieri V, Morlino S, Di Stolfo G, Mastroianno S, Mazza T, Castori M | title = Cardiac valvular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is a well-defined condition due to recessive null variants in COL1A2 | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

==Signs and symptoms==
This group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body, with symptoms most typically present in the joints, skin, and blood vessels. However, as connective tissue is found throughout the body, EDS may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity, and the condition is not limited to joints, skin, and blood vessels.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes?|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/|access-date=2021-02-16|website=The Ehlers Danlos Society}}</ref> Effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] complications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ehlers–Danlos syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndrome#genes|website=Genetic Home Reference|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> Due to the diversity of subtypes within the EDS family, symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with EDS.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ehlers Danlos Syndromes |url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/ |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)}}</ref>

===Skin===
The weak connective tissue causes abnormal skin. This may present as stretchy or in other types simply be velvet soft. In all types, some increased fragility occurs, but the degree varies depending on the underlying subtype. The skin may tear and bruise easily, and may heal with abnormal atrophic scars;<ref name="mayoclinic"/> atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal.<ref name="NIHGHR2016"/><ref name="Byers2012"/><ref name = "Malfait_2018" /> In some subtypes, though not the hypermobile subtype, redundant skin folds occur, especially on the eyelids.

Variations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder.<ref name="NIHGHR2016"/> Inheritance patterns depend on the specific syndrome.

Most forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder. A few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected. It can also be an individual (''de novo'' or "sporadic") [[mutation|variation]]. Sporadic variations occur without any inheritance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/|title=EDS Types |work=The Ehlers Danlos Society|access-date=2017-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624041438/https://ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/|archive-date=2017-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref><!-- Refer to the summary for each Ehlers–Danlos syndrome for a discussion of its inheritance pattern. -->

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation. The [[Hypermobility (joints)#Beighton criteria|Beighton criteria]] are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected people. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene-variant testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity, but these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped variation, so clinical evaluation remains important. If multiple members of a family are affected, prenatal diagnosis may be possible using a DNA information technique known as a linkage study.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sobey G | title = Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: how to diagnose and when to perform genetic tests | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24994860 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2013-304822 | s2cid = 11660992 | url = http://adc.bmj.com/content/100/1/57 | doi-access = free}} {{free access}}</ref> Knowledge about EDS among all kinds of practitioners is poor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross J, Grahame R | title = Joint hypermobility syndrome | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = c7167 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21252103 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7167 | s2cid = 1284069}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castori M | title = Ehlers–danlos syndrome, hypermobility type: an underdiagnosed hereditary connective tissue disorder with mucocutaneous, articular, and systemic manifestations | journal = ISRN Dermatology | volume = 2012 | page = 751768 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23227356 | pmc = 3512326 | doi = 10.5402/2012/751768 | doi-access = free}}</ref> Research is ongoing to identify genetic markers for all types.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/|title=The Types of EDS|work=The Ehlers Danlos Society|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Several disorders share some characteristics with EDS. For example, in [[cutis laxa]], the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body, but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In [[Marfan syndrome]], the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with EDS tend to have a "[[marfanoid]]" appearance (e.g., tall, skinny, long arms and legs, "spidery" fingers), but physical appearance and features in several types of EDS also have characteristics including short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder [[Loeys–Dietz syndrome]] also has symptoms that overlap with EDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|title=Differential Diagnosis |website=www.loeysdietz.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623074459/http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|archive-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>

In the past, [[Menkes disease]], a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of EDS. People are commonly misdiagnosed with [[fibromyalgia]], [[Coagulopathy|bleeding disorders]], or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is important.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |title=Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome |publisher=Rarediseases.about.com |date=2006-05-25 |access-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011912/http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |archive-date=2014-04-12}}</ref> [[Pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] is worth consideration in diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudoxanthoma-elasticum|title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum |website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>

== Management ==
No cure for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is known, and treatment is supportive. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. This can help stabilize the joints and prevent injury. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances. People should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/physiotherapy-and-self-management/|title=Physiotherapy and self-management – The Ehlers–Danlos Support UK|website=www.ehlers-danlos.org|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>

A physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints. Physicians may refer a person to an orthotist for [[orthotics|orthotic treatment]] (bracing). Physicians may also consult a physical and/or occupational therapist to help strengthen muscles and to teach people how to properly use and preserve their joints.<ref name=Rombaut11>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rombaut L, Malfait F, De Wandele I, Cools A, Thijs Y, De Paepe A, Calders P | title = Medication, surgery, and physiotherapy among patients with the hypermobility type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 1106–1112 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21636074 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2011.01.016 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20158514}}</ref><ref name="wristpr">{{ cite journal |vauthors=Woerdeman LA, Ritt MJ, Meijer B, Maas M |url= https://www.academia.edu/24725432 |title= Wrist problems in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome|journal=European Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=208–210 |year=2000 | doi=10.1007/s002380050252|s2cid= 29979747}}</ref>

In general, medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy. Before pregnancy, people with EDS may be recommended to have genetic counseling and to familiarize themselves with the risks pregnancy poses. Children with EDS should be given information about the disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities. Children should be taught that they should not demonstrate the unusual positions they can maintain due to loose joints, as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Emotional support along with behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health. Family members, teachers, and friends should be informed about EDS so they can accept and assist the child.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Giroux CM, Corkett JK, Carter LM |date=2016|title=The Academic and Psychosocial Impacts of Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome on Postsecondary Students: An Integrative Review of the Literature.|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1133767.pdf |journal=Journal of Postsecondary Education and Disability |volume=29|issue=4|page=414}}</ref>

=== Pain management ===
Successful treatment of chronic pain in EDS requires a multidisciplinary team. The ways to manage pain can be to modify pain management techniques used in the normal population. Pain is classified into several types. One is [[nociceptive]], which is caused by an injury sustained to tissues. Another is [[neuropathic pain]], caused by abnormal signals by the nervous system. In many cases, the pain individuals experience is an unequal mix of the two. [[Physiotherapy]] (exercise rehabilitation) can be helpful, especially stabilizing the core and the joints. Stretching exercises must be reduced to slow and gentle stretching to reduce the risks of dislocations or subluxations. Usable methods may include posture reeducation, muscle release, joint mobilization, trunk stabilization, and manual therapy for overworked muscles. [[Cognitive behavioural therapy]] is used in many chronic pain patients, especially those who have severe, chronic, life-controlling pain that is unresponsive to treatment. It has not been checked for efficiency in clinical trials. The state of pain management with EDS is considered insufficient.<ref name=":5" />

==== Medications ====
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]]) may help if the pain is caused by inflammation. But long-term use of NSAIDs is often a risk factor for gastrointestinal, renal, and blood-related side effects. It can worsen symptoms of [[mast cell activation syndrome]], a disease that may be associated with EDS. [[Acetaminophen]] can be used to avoid the bleeding-related side effects of NSAIDs.<ref name=":5" />

[[Opioid]]s have shown efficiency in some EDS cases for the management of both acute and chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arthur K, Caldwell K, Forehand S, Davis K | title = Pain control methods in use and perceived effectiveness by patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: a descriptive study | journal = Disability and Rehabilitation | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 1063–1074 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26497567 | doi = 10.3109/09638288.2015.1092175 | s2cid = 41365171}}</ref>

[[Lidocaine]] can be applied topically after subluxations and painful gums. It can also be injected into painful areas in the case of musculoskeletal pain.<ref name=":5" />

If the pain is neuropathic in origin, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s in low doses, [[anticonvulsant]]s, and [[selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s can be used.<ref name=":5" />

====Dislocation and subluxation management====
When a dislocation or subluxation does occur, muscle spasms and stress tend to occur, increasing pain and reducing the chances of the dislocation/subluxation naturally relieving. Methods to support a joint after such an incident include usage of a sling to hold the joint in place and allow it to relax. Orthopedic casts are not advised as there could be pain if unrelaxed muscles are still trying to spasm out against the cast. Other solutions to promote relaxation are heat, gentle massaging, and mental distractions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dislocation/Subluxation Management |url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/dislocation-subluxation-management/ |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=The Ehlers Danlos Society}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
The instability of joints, leading to subluxations and joint pain, often requires surgical intervention in people with EDS. Instability of almost all joints can happen, but appears most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.<ref name=Rombaut11/>

Common surgical procedures are joint [[debridement]], tendon replacements, [[capsulorrhaphy]], and [[arthroplasty]]. After surgery, the degree of stabilization, pain reduction, and people's satisfaction can improve, but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result; affected peoples and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results. The consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery,<ref name=Camerota14/> particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS – the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete.<ref name=Rombaut11/> If considering surgical intervention, seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with EDS and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent.<ref name="Recommendations for anesthesia and">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiesmann T, Castori M, Malfait F, Wulf H | title = Recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative management in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome(s) | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 9 | page = 109 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25053156 | pmc = 4223622 | doi = 10.1186/s13023-014-0109-5 | doi-access = free}}</ref>

Local anesthetics, [[arterial catheter]]s, and [[central venous catheters]] cause a higher risk of [[haematoma|bruise formation]] in people with EDS. Some people with EDS also show a resistance to local anaesthetics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parapia LA, Jackson C | s2cid = 7809153 | title = Ehlers–Danlos syndrome – a historical review | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 141 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–35 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18324963 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.06994.x | doi-access = free}} {{free access}}</ref> Resistance to [[lidocaine]] and [[bupivacaine]] is not uncommon, and [[mepivacaine]] tends to work better in people with EDS. Special recommendations for anesthesia are given for people with EDS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} Detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of people with EDS should be used to improve safety.<ref name="Recommendations for anesthesia and"/>

Surgery in people with EDS requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shirley ED, Demaio M, Bodurtha J | title = Ehlers–danlos syndrome in orthopaedics: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment implications | journal = Sports Health | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 394–403 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23016112 | pmc = 3435946 | doi = 10.1177/1941738112452385}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
The outcome for individuals with EDS depends on the specific type of EDS they have. Symptoms vary in severity, even in the same disorder, and the frequency of complications varies. Some people have negligible symptoms, while others are severely restricted in daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in hEDS than in classical EDS or vascular EDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/|title=What are the Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes?|website=The Ehlers Danlos Society|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>

Although all types of EDS are potentially life-threatening,<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto2"/><ref name="pmid35986728"/> most people have a normal lifespan. Those with blood vessel fragility, though, have a high risk of fatal complications, including spontaneous arterial rupture, which is the most common cause of sudden death. The median life expectancy in the population with vascular EDS is 48 years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepin M, Schwarze U, Superti-Furga A, Byers PH | title = Clinical and genetic features of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type IV, the vascular type | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 342 | issue = 10 | pages = 673–680 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10706896 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200003093421001 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.603.1293}} {{free access}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Ehlers–Danlos syndromes are estimated to occur in about one in 5,000 births worldwide. Initially, prevalence estimates ranged from one in 250,000 to 500,000 people, but these were soon found to be low, as medical professionals became more adept at diagnosis. EDS may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/466834_3 |title=Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome: Epidemiology |publisher=Medscape.com |access-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424220037/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/466834_3 |archive-date=2013-04-24}}</ref>

The prevalence of the disorders differs dramatically. The most common is hypermobile EDS, followed by classical EDS. The others are very rare. For example, fewer than 10 infants and children with dermatosparaxis EDS have been described worldwide.

Some types of EDS are more common in [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. For example, the chance of being a carrier for dermatosparaxis EDS is one in 2,000 in the general population but one in 248 among Ashkenazi Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geneaware.clinical.bcm.edu/GeneAware/AboutGeneAware/DiseaseDetails.aspx?DiseaseID=335|title=Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VIIc |website=geneaware.clinical.bcm.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814220911/https://geneaware.clinical.bcm.edu/GeneAware/AboutGeneAware/DiseaseDetails.aspx?DiseaseID=335|archive-date=2017-08-14|url-status=live|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>

== History ==
Until 1997, the classification system for EDS included 10 specific types and acknowledged that other extremely rare types existed. At this time, the classification system underwent an overhaul and was reduced to six major types using descriptive titles. Genetic specialists recognize that other types of this condition exist, but have only been documented in single families. Except for [[Hypermobility (joints)|hypermobility]] (type 3), the most common type of all 10 types, some of the specific variations involved have been identified, and they can be precisely identified by [[genetic testing]]; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. Negative genetic test results, though, do not rule out the diagnosis, since not all of the variations have been discovered; therefore, the clinical presentation is very important.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|title=What is EDS | work = The Ehlers–Danlos National Foundation |access-date=2016-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150505/http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|archive-date=2016-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Forms of EDS in this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic [[diarrhea]], joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns in this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Examples of types of related syndromes other than those above reported in the medical literature include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.omim.org/search/?index=entry&start=1&limit=10&sort=score+desc,+prefix_sort+desc&search=ehlers-danlos+syndrome+|title = Ehlers–Danlos syndrome | work = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) |access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref>

===Representation in media===
====Literature====
The fantasy novel ''[[Fourth Wing]]'' by [[Rebecca Yarros]] presents a main character, Violet Sorrengail, who has an unnamed chronic condition that aligns closely with EDS symptoms. When asked about this connection Rebecca Yarros agrees with the connection but says EDS goes unnamed due to the level of medical knowledge present in her story's world. Yarros has EDS and included it as representation of her condition.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Straetker R | date = 9 August 2023 |title=What Condition Does Violet Have in Fourth Wing? Rebecca Yarros Reveals Answer |url=https://www.health.com/rebecca-yarros-fourth-wing-interview-7569752 |website=Health}}</ref>

====Television====
''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', a long running TV-series, approached the topic of EDS in their [[Grey's Anatomy (season 13)|13th season]]. In the episode "[[Falling Slowly (Grey's Anatomy episode)|Falling Slowly]]", the show's doctors are confronted with confusion when met with diagnosing a patient. Due to complex and contradicting symptoms presented by the patient the show's doctors ultimately give the diagnosis of EDS. This episode was based on conversations held by producers who talked with a patient and doctor who have EDS.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) on ''Grey's Anatomy''! |url=https://edswellness.org/ehlers-danlos-syndrome-eds-greys-anatomy/ |publisher=EDS Wellness |date=14 October 2016}}</ref>
