By the 1970s, it became usual to require that all taxa be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (derived from a common ancestor that would also be regarded as protozoan), and [[Monophyly|holophyletic]] (containing all of the known descendants of that common ancestor). The taxon 'Protozoa' fails to meet these standards, so grouping protozoa with animals, and treating them as closely related, became no longer justifiable.

The term continues to be used in a loose way to describe single-celled protists (that is, eukaryotes that are not animals, [[plant]]s, or [[fungus|fungi]]) that feed by [[heterotroph]]y.<ref name="Yaeger">{{Cite book |last=Yaeger |first=Robert G. |date=1996 |editor-last=Baron |editor-first=Samuel |title=Protozoa: Structure, Classification, Growth, and Development |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8325/ |access-date=2020-07-07 |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |pmid=21413323|isbn=9780963117212 }}</ref> Traditional textbook examples of protozoa are ''[[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]'', ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma]]''.<ref name="Ruggiero-2015">{{Cite journal |last1=Ruggiero |first1=Michael A. |last2=Gordon |first2=Dennis P. |last3=Orrell |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Bailly |first4=Nicolas |last5=Bourgoin |first5=Thierry |last6=Brusca |first6=Richard C. |last7=Cavalier-Smith |first7=Thomas |author-link=Tom Cavalier-Smith |last8=Guiry |first8=Michael D. |last9=Kirk |first9=Paul M. |date=29 April 2015 |title=A Higher Level Classification of All Living Organisms |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=e0119248 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1019248R|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0119248 |pmc=4418965 |pmid=25923521 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The word "protozoa" ''(singular ''protozoon'')'' was coined in 1818 by [[zoologist]] [[Georg August Goldfuss]] (=Goldfuß), as the Greek equivalent of the German ''{{lang|de|Urthiere}}'', meaning "primitive, or original animals" (''{{lang|de|{{linktext|ur-}}}}'' 'proto-' + ''{{lang|de|{{linktext|Thier}}}}'' 'animal').<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rothschild |first=Lynn J. |author-link=Lynn J.

In 1848, with better microscopes and [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s [[cell theory]], the zoologist [[Karl Theodor Ernst von Siebold|C. T. von Siebold]] proposed that the bodies of protozoa such as [[ciliate]]s and [[amoeba]]e consisted of single cells, similar to those from which the [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] tissues of plants and animals were constructed. Von Siebold redefined Protozoa to include only such [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] forms, to the exclusion of all [[Animal|metazoa]] (animals).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Siebold (vol. 1) |last2=Stannius (vol. 2) |title=Lehrbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie |language=de |trans-title=Textbook of Comparative Anatomy |date=1848 |publisher=Veit & Co. |location=Berlin, (Germany) |volume= 1: ''Wirbellose Thiere'' (Invertebrate animals) |page=3 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/41783#page/21/mode/1up}}  From p. 3: ''"Erste Hauptgruppe.

(First principal group.  Protozoa.  Animals, in which the different systems of organs are not sharply separated, and whose irregular form and simple organization can be reduced to one cell.)</ref> At the same time, he raised the group to the level of a [[phylum]] containing two broad classes of microorganisms: [[Infusoria]] (mostly [[ciliate]]s) and [[flagellate]]s (flagellated protists and [[amoeba]]e). The definition of Protozoa as a phylum or sub-kingdom composed of "unicellular animals" was adopted by the zoologist [[Otto Bütschli]]—celebrated at his centenary as the "architect of protozoology".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dobell |first=C. |date=April 1951 |title=In memoriam Otto Bütschli (1848-1920) "architect of protozoology" |journal=Isis; an International Review Devoted to the History of Science and Its Cultural Influences |volume=42 |issue=127 |pages=20–22 |pmid=14831973 |doi=10.1086/349230 |s2cid=32569053}}</ref>

As a phylum under Animalia, the Protozoa were firmly rooted in a simplistic "two-kingdom" concept of life, according to which all living beings were classified as either animals or plants. As long as this scheme remained dominant, the protozoa were understood to be animals and studied in departments of Zoology, while photosynthetic microorganisms and microscopic fungi—the so-called Protophyta—were assigned to the Plants, and studied in departments of Botany.<ref name="Taylor-2003">{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=F.

Criticism of this system began in the latter half of the 19th century, with the realization that many organisms met the criteria for inclusion among both plants and animals. For example, the algae ''[[Euglena]]'' and ''[[Dinobryon]]'' have [[chloroplast]]s for [[photosynthesis]], like plants, but can also feed on organic matter and are [[Motility|motile]], like animals. In 1860, [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] argued against the use of "protozoa", on the grounds that "naturalists are divided in opinion—and probably some will ever continue so—whether many of these organisms or living beings, are animals or plants."<ref name="Hogg 1860"/> As an alternative, he proposed a new kingdom called Primigenum, consisting of both the protozoa and unicellular algae, which he combined under the name "Protoctista". In Hoggs's conception, the animal and plant kingdoms were likened to two great "pyramids" blending at their bases in the Kingdom Primigenum.<ref name="Hogg 1860">{{Cite journal |last=Hogg |first=John |author-link=John Hogg |date=1860 |title=On the distinctions of a plant and an animal, and on a fourth kingdom of nature |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044089575245;view=1up;seq=232 |journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal | series=2nd series | volume=12 | pages=216–225 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scamardella |first=J.

In 1866, [[Ernst Haeckel]] proposed a third kingdom of life, which he named Protista. At first, Haeckel included a few multicellular organisms in this kingdom, but in later work, he restricted the Protista to single-celled organisms, or simple colonies whose individual cells are not differentiated into different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref>(Haeckel, 1866), vol. 1, pp. 215 ff.  From p. 215:  ''"VII.  Character des Protistenreiches."'' (VII. Character of the kingdom of Protists.) From p. 216:  ''"VII.  B. Morphologischer Character des Protistenreiches.  Ba.  Character der protistischen Individualitäten.  Der wesentliche tectologische Character der Protisten liegt in der sehr unvollkommenen Ausbildung und Differenzirung der Individualität überhaupt, insbesondere aber derjenigen zweiter Ordnung, der Organe.

Despite these proposals, Protozoa emerged as the preferred taxonomic placement for [[Heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] microorganisms such as amoebae and ciliates, and remained so for more than a century. In the course of the 20th century, the old "two kingdom" system began to weaken, with the growing awareness that fungi did not belong among the plants, and that most of the unicellular protozoa were no more closely related to the animals than they were to the plants. By mid-century, some biologists, such as [[Herbert Copeland]], [[Robert Whittaker (ecologist)|Robert H. Whittaker]] and [[Lynn Margulis]], advocated the revival of Haeckel's Protista or Hogg's Protoctista as a kingdom-level eukaryotic group, alongside Plants, Animals and Fungi.<ref name="Taylor-2003" /> A variety of [[Kingdom (biology)|multi-kingdom systems]] were proposed, and the Kingdoms Protista and Protoctista became established in biology texts and curricula.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Whittaker |first=R.

=== Habitat ===

Free-living protozoa are common and often abundant in fresh, brackish and salt water, as well as other moist environments, such as soils and mosses. Some species thrive in extreme environments such as hot springs<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJAxvgAACAAJ&q=yellowstone+microorganisms|title=Seen and Unseen: Discovering the Microbes of Yellowstone|last=Sheehan|first=Kathy B.|date=2005 |publisher=Falcon |isbn=9780762730933}}</ref> and hypersaline lakes and lagoons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Post|first1=F.

=== Feeding ===

All protozoa are [[heterotroph]]ic, deriving nutrients from other organisms, either by ingesting them whole by [[phagocytosis]] or taking up dissolved organic matter or micro-particles ([[osmotrophy]]). [[Phagocytosis]] may involve engulfing organic particles with [[pseudopodia]] (as [[amoeba]]e do), taking in food through a specialized mouth-like aperture called a [[cytostome]], or using stiffened ingestion organelles<ref name="Fenchel, T 1987">Fenchel, T. 1987. Ecology of protozoan: The biology of free-living phagotrophic protists. Springer-Verlag, Berlin.</ref>

Parasitic protozoa use a wide variety of feeding strategies, and some may change methods of feeding in different phases of their life cycle. For instance, the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' feeds by [[pinocytosis]] during its immature [[trophozoite]] stage of life (ring phase), but develops a dedicated feeding [[organelle]] (cytostome) as it matures within a host's red blood cell.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |title=Biochemistry of Plasmodium |last=Wiser |first=Mark F. |website=The Wiser Page |access-date=2018-03-22 |archive-date=2017-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704155236/http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/malaria/fv.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Paramecium bursaria 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', is one example of a variety of freshwater ciliates that host [[endosymbiont]] chlorophyte algae from the genus ''[[Chlorella]]'']]

Protozoa may also live as [[mixotroph]]s, combining a heterotrophic diet with some form of [[autotroph]]y. Some protozoa form close associations with symbiotic photosynthetic algae (zoochlorellae), which live and grow within the membranes of the larger cell and provide nutrients to the host. The algae are not digested, but reproduce and are distributed between division products. The organism may benefit at times by deriving some of its nutrients from the algal endosymbionts or by surviving anoxic conditions because of the oxygen produced by algal photosynthesis. Some protozoans practice [[kleptoplasty]], stealing [[chloroplast]]s from prey organisms and maintaining them within their own cell bodies as they continue to produce nutrients through photosynthesis. The ciliate ''[[Mesodinium rubrum]]'' retains functioning [[plastid]]s from the cryptophyte algae on which it feeds, using them to nourish themselves by autotrophy. The symbionts may be passed along to dinoflagellates of the genus ''[[Dinophysis]]'', which prey on ''Mesodinium rubrum'' but keep the enslaved plastids for themselves. Within ''Dinophysis'', these plastids can continue to function for months.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nishitani |first1=Goh |last2=Nagai |first2=Satoshi |last3=Baba|first3=Katsuhisa |last4=Kiyokawa |first4=Susumu |last5=Kosaka|first5=Yuki |last6=Miyamura |first6=Kazuyoshi |last7=Nishikawa |first7=Tetsuya |last8=Sakurada |first8=Kiyonari |last9=Shinada |first9=Akiyoshi |display-authors=3 |date=May 2010 |title=High-Level Congruence of Myrionecta rubra Prey and Dinophysis Species Plastid Identities as Revealed by Genetic Analyses of Isolates from Japanese Coastal Waters |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76|issue=9 |pages=2791–2798 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02566-09 |pmc=2863437 |pmid=20305031 |bibcode=2010ApEnM..76.2791N }}</ref>

=== Motility ===

Organisms traditionally classified as protozoa are abundant in [[aqueous]] environments and [[soil]], occupying a range of [[trophic level]]s. The group includes [[flagellate]]s (which move with the help of undulating and beating [[flagella]]). [[Ciliate]]s (which move by using hair-like structures called [[cilia]]) and [[amoeba]]e (which move by the use of temporary extensions of cytoplasm called [[pseudopodia]]). Many protozoa, such as the agents of amoebic meningitis, use both pseudopodia and flagella.  Some protozoa attach to the substrate or form cysts so they do not move around ([[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]]).  Most sessile protozoa are able to move around at some stage in the life cycle, such as after cell division. The term 'theront' has been used for actively motile phases, as opposed to 'trophont' or 'trophozoite' that refers to feeding stages.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

=== Walls, pellicles, scales, and skeletons ===

Unlike plants, fungi and most types of algae, most protozoa do not have a rigid external [[cell wall]], but are usually enveloped by elastic structures of membranes that permit movement of the cell. In some protozoa, such as the ciliates and [[euglenozoa]]ns, the outer membrane of the cell is supported by a cytoskeletal infrastructure, which may be referred to as a "pellicle". The pellicle gives shape to the cell, especially during locomotion. Pellicles of protozoan organisms vary from flexible and elastic to fairly rigid. In [[ciliate]]s and [[Apicomplexa]], the pellicle includes a layer of closely packed vesicles called alveoli. In [[euglenid]]s, the pellicle is formed from [[protein]] strips arranged spirally along the length of the body. Familiar examples of protists with a pellicle are the [[euglenoids]] and the ciliate ''[[Paramecium]]''. In some protozoa, the pellicle hosts [[Epibiont|epibiotic]] bacteria that adhere to the surface by their [[Pilus#Fimbriae|fimbriae]] (attachment pili).

Some protozoa live within loricas - loose fitting but not fully intact enclosures.  For example, many collar flagellates ([[Choanoflagellate]]s) have an organic lorica or a lorica made from silicous sectretions. Loricas are also common among some green euglenids, various ciliates (such as the [[folliculinid]]s, various testate amoebae and [[foraminifera]]. The surfaces of a variety of protozoa are covered with a layer of scales and or spicules.  Examples include the [[amoeba]] [[Cochliopodium]], many centrohelid [[heliozoa]], [[synurophyte]]s.  The layer is often assumed to have a protective role. In some, such as the actinophryid heliozoa, the scales only form when the organism encysts. The bodies of some protozoa are supported internally by rigid, often inorganic, elements (as in [[Acantharea]], [[Pylocystinea]], [[Phaeodarea]] - collectively the '[[radiolaria]]', and [[Ebriida]]).

=== Life cycle ===

Protozoa mostly reproduce asexually by [[binary fission]] or multiple fission. Many protozoa also exchange genetic material by sexual means (typically, through [[Isogamy#Conjugation|conjugation]]), but this is generally decoupled from reproduction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/life-sciences/evolutionary-biology/sex-and-death-protozoa-history-obsession |title=Sex and Death in Protozoa |website=Cambridge University Press |access-date=2015-06-09}}</ref> [[Origin and function of meiosis|Meiotic sex]] is widespread among [[eukaryote]]s, and must have originated early in their evolution, as it has been found in many protozoan lineages that diverged early in eukaryotic evolution.<ref>Bernstein, H.; Bernstein, C. (2013). ''Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis''. Meiosis. InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}</ref>{{pn|date=May 2023}}

===Aging===

In the well studied protozoan species ''Paramecium tetraurelia'', the asexual line undergoes clonal aging, loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation.  The functional basis for clonal aging was clarified by [[Transplantation chimera|transplantation]] experiments of Aufderheide in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aufderheide|first=Karl J.|year=1986|title=Clonal aging in ''Paramecium tetraurelia''. II. Evidence of functional changes in the macronucleus with age|journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development|volume=37|issue=3|pages=265–279|doi=10.1016/0047-6374(86)90044-8|pmid=3553762|s2cid=28320562}}</ref>  These experiments demonstrated that the macronucleus, and not the cytoplasm, is responsible for clonal aging.

In this single-celled protozoan, aging appears to proceed in a manner similar to that of multicellular [[eukaryote]]s (see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]).

== Ecology ==

=== Free-living ===

Free-living protozoa are found in almost all ecosystems that contain free water, permanently or temporarily. They have a critical role in the mobilization of nutrients in ecosystems. Within the [[microbial food web]] they include the most important bacterivores.<ref name="Fenchel, T 1987"/> In part, they facilitate the transfer of bacterial and algal production to successive [[Trophic pyramid|trophic levels]], but also they solubilize the nutrients within microbial biomass, allowing stimulation of microbial growth. As consumers, protozoa prey upon [[unicellular]] or [[filamentous algae]], [[bacteria]], [[microfungi]], and micro-carrion. In the context of older ecological models of the [[Fauna (animals)#Microfauna|micro-]] and [[Fauna (animals)#Meiofauna|meiofauna]], protozoa may be a food source for [[microinvertebrate]]s.

Most species of free-living protozoa live in similar habitats in all parts of the world.<!-- as was first observed by [[Vladimir Shevyakov|W.

Some of these protozoa have two-phase life cycles, alternating between proliferative stages (e.g., [[trophozoite]]s) and resting [[Microbial cyst|cysts]], enabling them to survive harsh conditions.<ref name="Yaeger 1996">{{cite book |last1=Yaeger |first1=Robert G. |editor1-last=Baron |editor1-first=S |title=Medical Microbiology |date=1996 |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |location=Galveston, Texas |edition=4th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8325/ |chapter=Chapter 77Protozoa: Structure, Classification, Growth, and Development|pmid=21413323 |isbn=9780963117212 }}</ref>

=== Commensalism ===

A wide range of protozoa live [[Commensalism|commensally]] in the rumens of [[ruminant]] animals, such as cattle and sheep. These include flagellates, such as ''[[Trichomonas]]'', and ciliated protozoa, such as ''[[Isotricha]]'' and ''[[Entodinium]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Rumen Microbial Ecosystem |last1=Williams |first1=A.

=== Mutualism ===

Association between protozoan symbionts and their host organisms can be [[Mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]]. Flagellated protozoa such as ''[[Trichonympha]]'' and ''[[Pyrsonympha]]'' inhabit the guts of [[termite]]s, where they enable their insect host to digest wood by helping to break down complex [[sugar]]s into smaller, more easily digested molecules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kennethnoll.uconn.edu/nsf-termite-project/termite-gut-microbes.html |title=Termite gut microbes {{!}} NOLL LAB|website=www.kennethnoll.uconn.edu|access-date=2018-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321060255/http://www.kennethnoll.uconn.edu/nsf-termite-project/termite-gut-microbes.html |archive-date=2018-03-21 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
