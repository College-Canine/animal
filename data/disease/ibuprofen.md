=== Interactions ===

==== Alcohol ====
Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of [[stomach bleeding]].<ref name="drugs">{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/ibuprofen.html|title=Ibuprofen|publisher=Drugs.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806064653/http://www.drugs.com/ibuprofen.html|archive-date=6 August 2011}}</ref>

==== Aspirin ====
According to the FDA, "ibuprofen can interfere with the [[antiplatelet]] effect of low-dose [[aspirin]], potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for [[cardioprotection]] and [[stroke]] prevention". Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30&nbsp;minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and 8&nbsp;hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for [[Enteric coating|enteric-coated]] aspirin. If ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, though, the reduction of the cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal.<ref name='FDA2006'>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm125222.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Concomitant Use of Ibuprofen and Aspirin |access-date=22 November 2010 |date=September 2006 |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113035657/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm125222.htm |archive-date=13 November 2010 }}

==== Paracetamol ====
Ibuprofen combined with [[paracetamol]] is considered generally safe in children for short-term usage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanabar DJ | title = A clinical and safety review of paracetamol and ibuprofen in children | journal = Inflammopharmacology | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28063133 | pmc = 5306275 | doi = 10.1007/s10787-016-0302-3 }}</ref>

===Overdose===
Ibuprofen overdose has become common since it was licensed for [[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] use. Many overdose experiences are reported in the [[Medical journal|medical literature]], although the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McElwee NE, Veltri JC, Bradford DC, Rollins DE | title = A prospective, population-based study of acute ibuprofen overdose: complications are rare and routine serum levels not warranted | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 657–662 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2188537 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82471-0 }}</ref> Human responses in cases of overdose range from an absence of symptoms to a fatal outcome despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of ibuprofen, and include abdominal pain, nausea, [[vomiting]], drowsiness, dizziness, headache, [[tinnitus|ear ringing]], and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]. Rarely, more severe symptoms, such as [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[seizures]], [[metabolic acidosis]], hyperkalemia, [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[coma]], liver dysfunction, [[acute kidney failure]], [[cyanosis]], [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], and [[cardiac arrest]] have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vale JA, Meredith TJ | title = Acute poisoning due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Generally, the symptoms observed with an overdose of ibuprofen are similar to the symptoms caused by overdoses of other NSAIDs.

Correlation between severity of symptoms and measured ibuprofen plasma levels is weak. Toxic effects are unlikely at doses below 100{{nbsp}}mg/kg, but can be severe above 400{{nbsp}}mg/kg (around 150 tablets of 200{{nbsp}}mg units for an average man);<ref name = Clinicalmedicine2003-Volans>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volans G, Hartley V, McCrea S, Monaghan J | title = Non-opioid analgesic poisoning | journal = Clinical Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–123 | date = March–April 2003 | pmid = 12737366 | pmc = 4952728 | doi = 10.7861/clinmedicine.3-2-119 }}</ref> however, large doses do not indicate the clinical course is likely to be lethal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Seifert SA, Bronstein AC, McGuire T | title = Massive ibuprofen ingestion with survival | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using [[activated charcoal]]; charcoal absorbs the drug before it can enter the [[systemic circulation|bloodstream]]. [[Gastric lavage]] is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60&nbsp;minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Position paper: Ipecac syrup | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and [[kidney function]] monitored.<ref name="Clinicalmedicine2003-Volans"/> Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, [[forced diuresis|forced alkaline diuresis]] is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall AH, Smolinske SC, Conrad FL, Wruk KM, Kulig KW, Dwelle TL, Rumack BH | title = Ibuprofen overdose: 126 cases | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1308–1313 | date = November 1986 | pmid = 3777588 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(86)80617-5 }}</ref>

===Miscarriage===
A Canadian study of pregnant women suggests that those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, [[diclofenac]], and [[naproxen]]) were 2.4 times more likely to [[miscarriage|miscarry]] than those not taking the medications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma P, Clark CA, Spitzer KA, Laskin CA, Ray J, Koren G | title = Use of non-aspirin NSAIDs during pregnancy may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion | journal = Evidence-Based Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 76–77 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22411163 | doi = 10.1136/ebnurs-2011-100439 | s2cid = 28521248 }}</ref> However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daniel S, Koren G, Lunenfeld E, Bilenko N, Ratzon R, Levy A | title = Fetal exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and spontaneous abortions | journal = CMAJ | volume = 186 | issue = 5 | pages = E177–E182 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24491470 | pmc = 3956584 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.130605 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen work by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX) enzymes, which convert [[arachidonic acid]] to [[Prostaglandin H2|prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>]] (PGH<sub>2</sub>). PGH<sub>2</sub>, in turn, is converted by other enzymes to several other [[prostaglandin]]s (which are mediators of pain, [[inflammation]], and fever) and to [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] (which stimulates [[platelet]] aggregation, leading to the formation of [[thrombus|blood clots]]).

Like aspirin and [[indomethacin]], ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor, in that it inhibits two [[isozyme|isoforms]] of cyclooxygenase, [[COX-1]] and [[COX-2]]. The [[analgesic]], [[antipyretic]], and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao P, Knaus EE | title = Evolution of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and beyond | journal = Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 81s–110s | date = September 2008 | pmid = 19203472 | doi = 10.18433/J3T886 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> However, the role of the individual COX isoforms in the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and gastric damage effects of NSAIDs is uncertain, and different compounds cause different degrees of analgesia and gastric damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kakuta H, Zheng X, Oda H, Harada S, Sugimoto Y, Sasaki K, Tai A | title = Cyclooxygenase-1-selective inhibitors are attractive candidates for analgesics that do not cause gastric damage. design and in vitro/in vivo evaluation of a benzamide-type cyclooxygenase-1 selective inhibitor | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 51 | issue = 8 | pages = 2400–2411 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18363350 | doi = 10.1021/jm701191z }}</ref>

Ibuprofen is administered as a [[racemic mixture]]. The ''R''-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the ''S''-enantiomer ''in vivo''.
