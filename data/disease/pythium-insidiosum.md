'''''Pythium insidiosum''''' is a species of ''[[Pythium]]'' and a member of the class [[Oomycete|oomycota]]. ''Pythium insidiosum'' is mainly found in standing water and occasionally soil. Unlike most ''Pythium'' species, which are generally [[Plant pathology|pathogens of terrestrial plants]], ''Pythium insidiosum'' is a pathogen of [[mammal]]s. It causes [[pythiosis]],<ref name="pmid12884950">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schurko AM, Mendoza L, Lévesque CA, Désaulniers NL, de Cock AW, Klassen GR |title=A molecular phylogeny of Pythium insidiosum |journal=Mycol.

Infection can occur in healthy mammals. The pathogen is well-adapted to mammalian body temperature, with an optimum temperature for growth of {{convert|34-36|°C}}.

The [[cell wall]]s of ''Pythium insidiosum'' are composed of [[β-glucan]]s and [[cellulose]] (compared to the [[chitin]] walls of [[fungi]]), and their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]s lack [[sterol]]s, molecules that are targets of antifungals. For this reason, infection caused by '''''Pythium insidiosum''''' is often difficult to treat.
