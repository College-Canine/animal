<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
A '''chalazion''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z|i|ə|n}}; plural chalazia or chalazions) or '''meibomian cyst'''<ref name="Kanski" /> is not a [[cyst]] but a [[granuloma]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sihota |first=Ramanjit |title=Parsons’ Diseases of the Eye |last2=Tandon |first2=Radhika |publisher=Elsevier |year=2020 |isbn=978-81-312-5415-8 |edition=23rd}}</ref> in the eyelid that results from a blocked [[meibomian gland]].<ref name=NIH2010>{{cite web|title=Eyelid Disorders Chalazion & Stye |url=https://nei.nih.gov/faqs/eyelid-disorders-chalazion-stye |publisher=[[National Eye Institute]] |access-date=14 October 2016 |date=4 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018231753/https://nei.nih.gov/faqs/eyelid-disorders-chalazion-stye |archive-date=18 October 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Korn |first=Bobby S. |title=2021-2022 Basic and Clinical Science Course, Section 07: Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery |publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology |year=2021 |isbn=978-1681044453 |pages=181}}</ref> It typically occurs in the middle of the eyelid, red, and not painful.<ref name=AFP2015/> They tend to come on gradually over a few weeks.<ref name=AFP2015>{{cite journal |last1=Carlisle |first1=RT |last2=Digiovanni |first2=J |title=Differential Diagnosis of the Swollen Red Eyelid |journal=American Family Physician |date=15 July 2015 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=106–12 |pmid=26176369 }}</ref>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
A chalazion may occur following a [[stye]] or from hardened oils blocking the gland.<ref name=AFP2015/> The blocked gland is usually the meibomian gland, but can also be the [[gland of Zeis]].<ref name=EM2013>{{cite journal |last1=Deibel |first1=JP |last2=Cowling |first2=K |title=Ocular inflammation and infection |journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America |date=May 2013 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=387–97 |pmid=23601478 |doi=10.1016/j.emc.2013.01.006 }}</ref>

A stye and [[periorbital cellulitis|cellulitis]] may appear similar.<ref name=AFP2015/> A stye, however, is usually more sudden in onset, painful, and occurs at the edge of the eyelid.<ref name=AFP2015/> Cellulitis is also typically painful.<ref name=AFP2015/>

<!-- Treatment, epidemiology, and culture -->
Treatment is initiated with [[warm compress]]es.<ref name=AFP2015/> In addition, [[antibiotic]]/[[corticosteroid]] eyedrops or ointment may be used. If this is not effective, injecting corticosteroids into the lesion may be tried.<ref name=AFP2015/> If large, [[incision and drainage]] may be recommended.<ref name="AFP2015"/> While relatively common, the frequency of the condition is unknown.<ref name=Rut2013>{{cite book |last1=Rutter |first1=Paul Professor |last2=Newby |first2=David |title=Community Pharmacy ANZ: Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment |date=2013 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780729583459 |page=57 |edition=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbjVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018204801/https://books.google.ca/books?id=NbjVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 |archive-date=2016-10-18 }}</ref> It is most common in people 30–50 years of age, and equally common in males and females.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FubqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA338-IA6|isbn = 9780323713344|title = Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2021 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date = 10 June 2020|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences}}</ref> The term is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc-Latn|khalazion}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|χαλάζιον}}) meaning "small hailstone".<ref>{{cite web |title=chalazion (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chalazion |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=15 October 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018222501/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chalazion |archive-date=18 October 2016 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Chalazion2 01242005 (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.3|Eyelid affected by a large chalazion]]
* Painless swelling on the [[eyelid]]
* Eyelid tenderness typically none-to-mild
* Increased [[Tears|tearing]]
* Heaviness of the eyelid
* Redness of [[conjunctiva]]

===Complications===
A large chalazion can cause [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] due to pressure on the [[cornea]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Ki Won|last2=Shin|first2=Young Joo|last3=Hyon|first3=Joon Young|date=2017-03-31|title=Effects of chalazia on corneal astigmatism|url= |journal=BMC Ophthalmology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=36|doi=10.1186/s12886-017-0426-2|issn=1471-2415|pmc=5374600|pmid=28359272 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

As [[laser eye surgery]] involves shaping the cornea by burning parts of it away, weakening its structure, post-operation people can be left predisposed to deformation of the cornea from small chalazia.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Shiel WC | title = Medical Definition of Laser surgery | publisher = MedicineNet | url = https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31889 | access-date = 7 July 2021 | archive-date = 27 October 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201027002833/https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=31889 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Complications of [[corticosteroid]] injection include [[hypopigmentation]] and fat atrophy which is less likely to occur in conjunctival approach of injection.<ref name="Kanski">{{cite book |last1=John F |first1=Salmon |title=Kanski's Clinical ophthalmology |publisher=Elsevier |pages= 39–41 |edition=9 |chapter=Eyelids}}</ref>

A chalazion that reoccurs in the same area may rarely be a symptom of [[sebaceous carcinoma]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Chalazion of the Eyelid.jpg|thumb|200px|Classic lipogranulomatous response seen in a well-developed chalazion]]
A chalazion or meibomian cyst can sometimes be mistaken for a [[stye]].

===Differential diagnosis===
* Sebaceous gland [[adenoma]]
* Sebaceous gland carcinoma
* [[Sarcoid granuloma]]
* [[Foreign body granuloma]]

==Treatment==

===General treatment===
Chalazia will often disappear without further treatment within a few months, and virtually all will resorb within two years.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite GPnotebook|2080768019|Chalazion}}</ref>

Healing can be facilitated by applying a moist [[warm compress]] to the affected eye for approximately 10–15 minutes, 4 times per day.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O15xDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA142|isbn = 9780826195197|title = Adult-Gerontology Practice Guidelines|date = 2019|publisher = Springer}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nd11DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|isbn = 9780803694798|title = Advanced Practice Nursing in the Care of Older Adults|date = 31 October 2018|publisher = F.A.

Topical [[antibiotic]] eye drops or ointment (e.g., [[chloramphenicol]] or [[fusidic acid]]) are sometimes used for the initial acute infection, but are otherwise of little value in treating a chalazion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/chalazion-what-is| title=Chalazion|website=WebMD |access-date= 7 July 2021}}</ref>

If they continue to enlarge or fail to settle within a few months, smaller lesions can be injected with a [[corticosteroid]].

Larger ones can be surgically removed using [[local anesthesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.1988.tb04609.x |vauthors=Khurana A, Ahluwalia B, Rajan C |title=Chalazion therapy.

If the chalazion is located directly under the eyelid's outer tissue, however, an excision from above may be more advisable so as not to inflict any unnecessary damage on the lid itself. Eyelid [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] usually mends well, without leaving any visible [[scar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.auge-online.de/Erkrankungen/Liderkrankungen/Gerstenkorn_Hagelkorn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020041629/http://www.auge-online.de/Erkrankungen/Liderkrankungen/Gerstenkorn_Hagelkorn/gerstenkorn_hagelkorn.html|title=Gerstenkorn/Hagelkorn &#124; Auge Online|archive-date=October 20, 2007|website=www.auge-online.de}}</ref> Depending on the chalazion's texture, the excision procedure varies: while fluid [[Pus|matter]] can easily be removed under minimal invasion, by merely puncturing the chalazion and exerting pressure upon the surrounding tissue, hardened matter usually necessitates a larger incision, through which it can be scraped out. Any residual matter should be metabolized in the course of the subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible [[hematoma]] around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. Chalazion excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional.

Chalazia may recur, and they will usually be [[Biopsy|biopsied]] to rule out the possibility of a tumour.<ref name="Kanski" />

===Antibiotic/corticosteroid eyedrops or ointment ===

A limited course of topical [[antibiotic]]/[[corticosteroid]] combination eyedrops or ointment such as [[tobramycin/dexamethasone]] may be effective in treating a chalazion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ihu7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA599|isbn = 9780323299466|title = Pediatric Ophthalmology, an Issue of Pediatric Clinics|date = 2014|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZKODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA367|isbn = 9780323567954|title = Pfenninger and Fowler's Procedures for Primary Care E-Book|date = 24 March 2019|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Conservative therapy for chalazia: is it really effective?|first1=Albert Y.|last1=Wu|first2=Kalla A.|last2=Gervasio|first3=Kellie N.|last3=Gergoudis|first4=Chen|last4=Wei|first5=James H.|last5=Oestreicher|first6=John T.|last6=Harvey|date=June 25, 2018|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica|volume=96|issue=4|pages=e503–e509|doi=10.1111/aos.13675|pmid=29338124|pmc=6047938}}</ref>

===Surgery===
[[Image:Chalazion (Excised) 02.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.3|A large chalazion ca. 20 minutes upon excision. This bipartite chalazion was removed via two separate incisions. Further, along the lower eyelid, signs of chronic inflammation ([[blepharitis]]) are visible.]]

Chalazion surgery is a simple procedure that is generally performed as a day operation, and the person does not need to remain in the hospital for further medical care. The eyelid is injected with a local anesthetic, a clamp is put on the eyelid, then the eyelid is turned over, an incision is made on the inside of the eyelid, and the chalazion is drained and scraped out with a [[curette]]. A scar on the upper lid can cause discomfort as some people feel the scar as they blink. As surgery damages healthy tissue (e.g., by scarring tissue or possibly even causing [[blepharitis]]), given other options, less invasive treatment is preferable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/chalazion/ | title=Chalazion|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library | date=27 October 2020|access-date= 7 July 2021}}</ref>

Chalazion removal surgery is performed under local or general [[anesthesia]]. Commonly, general anesthesia is administered in children to make sure they stay still and no injury to the eye occurs. Local anesthesia is used in adults and it is applied with a small [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] into the eyelid. The discomfort of the injection is minimized with the help of an anesthetic cream, which is applied locally.

The chalazion can be removed in two ways, depending on the size of cyst. Relatively small chalazia are removed through a small cut at the back of the eyelid.<ref name="Netdoctor">{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |title=Removal of chalazion |access-date=2010-04-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325221847/http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |archive-date=2010-03-25 |date=2009-07-06 }}</ref> The surgeon lifts the eyelid to access the back of its surface and makes an incision of approximately 3mm just on top of the chalazion. The lump is then removed, and pressure is applied for a few minutes to stop any oozing of blood that may occur because of the operation.<ref name="Netdoctor2">{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |title=The operation |access-date=2010-04-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325221847/http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/surgical-procedures/removal-of-chalazion.htm |archive-date=2010-03-25 |date=2009-07-06 }}</ref> Surgery of small chalazia does not require [[surgical suture|stitches]], as the cut is at the back of the eyelid and therefore the cut cannot be seen, and the cosmetic result is excellent.

Larger chalazia are removed through an incision in front of the eyelid. Larger chalazia usually push on the skin of the eyelid, and this is the main reason why doctors prefer removing them this way. The incision is not usually larger than 3mm and it is made on top of the chalazion. The lump is removed and then pressure is applied to the incision to prevent oozing. This type of surgery is closed with very fine stitches. They are hardly visible and are usually removed within a week after the surgery has been performed. Although chalazia are rarely dangerous, it is common to send the chalazion or part of it to a laboratory to screen for [[cancer]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

When surgery for a chalazion is considered, people who take [[aspirin]] or any other blood-thinning medications are advised to stop taking them one week prior to the procedure as they may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In rare cases, people are kept overnight in the hospital after chalazion surgery. This includes cases in which [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] occurred and the person needs to be closely monitored. In most cases, however, people are able to go home after the operation has ended.

The recovery process is easy and quite fast. Most people with chalazion experience some very minor discomfort in the eye, which can be easily controlled by taking painkilling medication. People are, however, recommended to avoid getting water in the eye for up to 10 days after surgery. They may wash, bathe, or shower, but they must be careful to keep the area dry and clean. Makeup may be worn after at least one month post-operatively. People are recommended to not wear contact lenses in the affected eye for at least eight weeks to prevent infections and potential complications.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Commonly, people receive [[eye drops]] to prevent infection and swelling in the eye and pain medication to help them cope with the pain and discomfort in the eyelid and eye. One can use [[paracetamol]] (acetominophen) rather than aspirin to control the pain. Also, after surgery, a pad and protective plastic shield are used to apply pressure on the eye in order to prevent leakage of blood after the operation; this may be removed 6 to 8 hours after the procedure.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

People who undergo chalazion surgery are normally asked to visit their eye surgeon for post-op follow-up three to four weeks after surgery has been performed.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Chalazion surgery is a safe procedure and complications seldom occur. Serious complications that require another operation are also very rare. Among potential complications, there are infection, bleeding, or the recurrence of the chalazion.

===Steroid injection===
Because the inflammatory cells of chalazia are sensitive to [[steroid]]s, intralesional or [[subcutaneous injection]] of soluble steroids, commonly 0.1 to 0.2 ml of [[triamcinolone acetonide]] (TA) into the lesion's center one or two times, is one option.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbY6Syu9QZEC&pg=PA135|isbn=9781420016321|title=Diagnostic Atlas of Common Eyelid Diseases|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eybg7fbs65MC&pg=PA390|isbn=9780750675765|title=Clinical Ocular Pharmacology|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences}}</ref> The success rate is in the 77% to 93% range.<ref name="auto2"/> It carries a quite small risk of [[central retinal artery]] obstruction, focal [[depigmentation]] in dark-skinned patients, and inadvertent [[ocular]] penetration.<ref name="auto1"/> It is considered a simple and effective treatment option, one with high success rates.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Non-Operative Management of Chalazion: Experiences at Tertiary Health Care Centre | author1=Kashinath Choudhary |author2=Vinod Bhagwat |author3=Manish Shyamkul |author4=Akshay Sathe |author5=Naser Razvi |journal=Walawalkar International Medical Journal |url=http://www.wimjournal.com/html/journal/images/5a1.pdf}}</ref> It may give the same results as surgical treatment (I&C).<ref name="Kanski" /> Larger, long-standing lesions are best treated surgically.<ref name="auto1"/> Considering the surgical risks, steroid injection is believed to be a safer procedure in marginal lesions and lesions close to [[lacrimal punctum]].<ref name="Kanski" />

One injection alone has a success rate of about 80%; if requested, a second injection can be given 1–2 weeks later.<ref name="Kanski" />

===Carbon dioxide laser===
Chalazion excision using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser is also a safer procedure, with minimal bleeding and no eye patching  required.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Korn EL |title=Laser chalazion removal |journal=Ophthalmic Surgery |date=1988-06-01|volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=428–431 |pmid=3419780 }}</ref>
