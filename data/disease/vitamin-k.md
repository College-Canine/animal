'''Vitamin K''' is a family of structurally similar, [[fat-soluble]] [[vitamer]]s found in foods and marketed as dietary supplements.<ref name="ods">{{cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitaminK-HealthProfessional/|title=Fact Sheet for Health Professionals – Vitamin K|website=US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements|date=June 2020 |access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref> The [[human body]] requires vitamin K for [[post-translational modification|post-synthesis modification]] of certain [[proteins]] that are required for [[blood]] [[coagulation]] ("K" from German/Danish ''koagulation'', for "coagulation") or for controlling [[molecular binding|binding]] of [[calcium]] in [[bones]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref name="Higdon">{{cite web | title = Vitamin K | publisher = Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University |location=Corvallis, OR | date = July 2014 | url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminK/ |access-date=20 March 2017}}</ref> The complete synthesis involves final modification of these so-called "[[Gla domain|Gla proteins]]" by the enzyme [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]] that uses vitamin K as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].

Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-[[methyl]]-[[1,4-naphthoquinone]] (3-) [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]]. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: [[phylloquinone|vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]] ([[phylloquinone]]) and [[Vitamin K2|vitamin K<sub>2</sub>]] ([[menaquinone]]).<ref name=PKIN2020VitK>{{cite book |title = Present Knowledge in Nutrition, Eleventh Edition |chapter = Vitamin K |editor=BP Marriott |editor2=DF Birt |editor3=VA Stallings|editor4=AA Yates |publisher = Academic Press (Elsevier) |year=2020 |location = London, United Kingdom |pages = 137–54 |isbn=978-0-323-66162-1|doi=10.1002/9781119946045.ch15}}</ref> Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of [[Isoprene#isoprenoids|isoprenoid]] groups of atoms. The two most studied ones are menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).

Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in [[Leaf vegetable|green leafy vegetables]], because it is directly involved in photosynthesis. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, variant MK-4. [[Bacteria]] in the [[gut flora]] can also convert K<sub>1</sub> into K<sub>2</sub>. All forms of K<sub>2</sub> other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these during [[anaerobic respiration]]. Vitamin K<sub>3</sub> ([[menadione]]), a synthetic form of vitamin K, was used to treat vitamin K deficiency, but because it interferes with the function of [[glutathione]], it is no longer used in this manner in human nutrition.<ref name=Higdon/>

==Definition==
Vitamin K refers to structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamers found in foods and marketed as dietary supplements. "Vitamin K" include several chemical compounds. These are similar in structure in that they share a quinone ring, but differ in the length and degree of saturation of the carbon tail and the number of repeating isoprene units in the side chain (see figures in Chemistry section). Plant-sourced forms are primarily vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. Animal-sourced foods are primarily vitamin K<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="ods" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritiondata.com/|title=Nutrition facts, calories in food, labels, nutritional information and analysis|website=Nutritiondata.com|date=13 February 2008|access-date=21 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=USDA-VitK /> Vitamin K has several roles: an essential nutrient absorbed from food, a product synthesized and marketed as part of a multi-vitamin or as a single-vitamin dietary supplement, and a prescription medication for specific purposes.<ref name="ods" />

==Dietary recommendations==
The US [[National Academy of Medicine]] does not distinguish between K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;– both are counted as vitamin K. When recommendations were last updated in 1998, sufficient information was not available to establish an [[Estimated Average Requirement|estimated average requirement]] or [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|recommended dietary allowance]], terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as these, the academy defines [[adequate intake]]s (AIs) as amounts that appear to be sufficient to maintain good health, with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AIs for adult women and men ages 19 and older are 90 and 120&nbsp;μg/day, respectively, for pregnancy is 90&nbsp;μg/day, and for lactation is 90&nbsp;μg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 2.0–2.5&nbsp;μg/day; for children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75&nbsp;μg/day. As for safety, the academy sets [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as "upper limits") for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Vitamin K has no upper limit, as human data for adverse effects from high doses are not sufficient.<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book|chapter=Vitamin K|chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/7 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc|publisher=National Academy Press|date=2001|pages=162–196|doi=10.17226/10026 |pmid=25057538 |isbn=978-0-309-07279-3 |author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Panel on Micronutrients}}</ref>

In the European Union, adequate intake is defined the same way as in the US. For women and men over age 18 the adequate intake is set at 70&nbsp;μg/day, for pregnancy 70&nbsp;μg/day, and for lactation 70&nbsp;μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, adequate intake values increase with age from 12 to 65&nbsp;μg/day.<ref name=EFSAAIs>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> Japan set adequate intakes for adult women at 65&nbsp;μg/day and for men at 75&nbsp;μg/day.<ref name=JapanDRI>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sasaki S |title=Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) in Japan |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |volume=17 |pages=420–44 |date=2008 |issue=Suppl 2 |pmid=18460442}}</ref> The European Union and Japan also reviewed safety and concluded&nbsp;– as had the United States&nbsp;– that there was insufficient evidence to set an upper limit for vitamin K.<ref name=JapanDRI /><ref name=EFSA>{{cite web | title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value. For vitamin K labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 80&nbsp;μg, but on 27 May 2016 it was revised upwards to 120&nbsp;μg, to bring it into agreement with the highest value for adequate intake.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.

===Fortification===
According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, vitamin K deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified.<ref name=Map>{{cite web|url=https://fortificationdata.org/map-number-of-nutrients/|title=Map: Count of Nutrients in Fortification Standards|website=Global Fortification Data Exchange|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] does not have recommendations on vitamin K fortification.<ref name=WHOfortif>{{cite web|vauthors=Allen L, de Benoist B, Dary O, Hurrell R, Horton S |url=https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224150912/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 December 2006 |title=Guidelines on food fortification with micronutrients |website=World Health Organization (WHO) |date=2006 |access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref>

== Sources ==
Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is primarily from plants, especially leafy green vegetables. Small amounts are provided by animal-sourced foods. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> is primarily from animal-sourced foods, with poultry and eggs much better sources than beef, pork or fish.<ref name=USDA-VitK /> One exception to the latter is ''[[nattō]]'', which is made from bacteria-fermented soybeans. It is a rich food source of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> variant MK-7, made by the bacteria.<ref name=Tarvainen2019>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarvainen M, Fabritius M, Yang B |title=Determination of vitamin K composition of fermented food |journal=Food Chem |volume=275 |pages=515–22 |date=March 2019 |pmid=30724228 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.09.136 |s2cid=73427205}}</ref>

==Vitamin K deficiency==
{{Main|Vitamin K deficiency}}

Because vitamin K aids mechanisms for blood clotting, its deficiency may lead to reduced blood clotting, and in severe cases, can result in reduced clotting, increased bleeding, and increased [[prothrombin time]].<ref name=Higdon /><ref name="DRItext" />

Normal diets are usually not deficient in vitamin K, indicating that deficiency is uncommon in healthy children and adults.<ref name=PKIN2020VitK /> An exception may be infants who are at an increased risk of deficiency regardless of the vitamin status of the mother during pregnancy and breast feeding due to poor transfer of the vitamin to the placenta and low amounts of the vitamin in breast milk.<ref name=Mihatsch2016 />

Secondary deficiencies can occur in people who consume adequate amounts, but have malabsorption conditions, such as [[cystic fibrosis]] or chronic pancreatitis, and in people who have [[liver disease|liver damage or disease]].<ref name=Higdon />  Secondary vitamin K deficiency can also occur in people who have a prescription for a vitamin K antagonist drug, such as warfarin.<ref name=Higdon /><ref name=PKIN2020VitK /> A drug associated with increased risk of vitamin K deficiency is [[cefamandole]], although the mechanism is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong RS, Cheng G, Chan NP, Wong WS, NG MH |title=Use of cefoperazone still needs a caution for bleeding from induced vitamin K deficiency |journal=Am J Hematol |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=76 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16369967 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20449 |doi-access= }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
[[File:Vitamina K 20220202 122653.jpg|thumb|Injectable solutions of vitamin K]]

=== Treating vitamin deficiency in newborns ===
Vitamin K is given as an injection to newborns to prevent [[vitamin K deficiency bleeding]].<ref name=Mihatsch2016 /> The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this appears to be a consequence of poor transfer of the vitamin across the placenta, and thus low fetal plasma vitamin K.<ref name=Mihatsch2016 /> Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at between 1 in 60 and 1 in 250.<ref>{{Cite web |author-link=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=July 24, 2023 |title=What is Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding? |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/vitamink/facts.html |access-date=April 18, 2024}}</ref> 

[[Human milk]] contains 0.85–9.2&nbsp;μg/L (median 2.5&nbsp;μg/L) of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, while infant formula is formulated in range of 24–175&nbsp;μg/L.<ref name=Mihatsch2016 /> Late onset bleeding, with onset 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be a consequence of exclusive breastfeeding, especially if there was no preventive treatment.<ref name=Mihatsch2016 /> Late onset prevalence reported at 35 cases per 100,000 live births in infants who had not received prophylaxis at or shortly after birth.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sankar MJ, Chandrasekaran A, Kumar P, Thukral A, Agarwal R, Paul VK |title=Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: a systematic review |journal=J Perinatol |volume=36 |pages=S29–35 |date=May 2016 |issue=Suppl 1 |pmid=27109090 |pmc=4862383 |doi=10.1038/jp.2016.30 }}</ref> Vitamin K deficiency bleeding occurs more frequently in the Asian population compared to the Caucasian population.<ref name=Mihatsch2016 />

Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, [[brain damage]], and death.

===Managing warfarin therapy===

[[Warfarin]] is an [[anticoagulant]] drug. It functions by inhibiting an enzyme that is responsible for recycling vitamin K to a functional state. As a consequence, proteins that should be modified by vitamin K are not, including proteins essential to blood clotting, and are thus not functional.<ref name="Whitlon" /> The purpose of the drug is to reduce risk of inappropriate blood clotting, which can have serious, potentially fatal consequences.<ref name=Higdon /> The proper anticoagulant action of warfarin is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose. Due to differing absorption of the drug and amounts of vitamin K in the diet, dosing must be monitored and customized for each patient.<ref name=Gong2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong IY, Schwarz UI, Crown N, Dresser GK, Lazo-Langner A, Zou G, Roden DM, Stein CM, Rodger M, Wells PS, Kim RB, Tirona RG | title = Clinical and genetic determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during treatment initiation | journal = PLOS ONE| volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = e27808 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22114699 | pmc = 3218053 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0027808 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...627808G | doi-access = free }}</ref> Some foods are so high in vitamin K<sub>1</sub> that medical advice is to avoid those (examples: collard greens, spinach, turnip greens) entirely, and for foods with a modestly high vitamin content, keep consumption as consistent as possible, so that the combination of vitamin intake and warfarin keep the anti-clotting activity in the therapeutic range.<ref name="auto1" />

In animals, vitamin K is involved in the [[carboxylation]] of certain [[glutamate]] residues in proteins to form [[gamma-carboxyglutamate]] (Gla) residues.

=== Absorption ===
Vitamin K is absorbed through the [[jejunum]] and [[ileum]] in the [[small intestine]]. The process requires [[bile]] and [[pancreatic juice]]s. Estimates for absorption are on the order of 80% for vitamin K<sub>1</sub> in its free form (as a dietary supplement) but much lower when present in foods. For example, the absorption of vitamin K from kale and spinach&nbsp;– foods identified as having a high vitamin K content&nbsp;– are on the order of 4% to 17% regardless of whether raw or cooked.<ref name=PKIN2020VitK /> Less information is available for absorption of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> from foods.<ref name=PKIN2020VitK /><ref name="DRItext" />

The intestinal membrane protein [[NPC1L1|Niemann–Pick C1-like 1]] (NPC1L1) mediates cholesterol absorption. Animal studies show that it also factors into absorption of vitamins E and K<sub>1</sub>.<ref name="Yamanashi2017">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamanashi Y, Takada T, Kurauchi R, Tanaka Y, Komine T, Suzuki H |title=Transporters for the Intestinal Absorption of Cholesterol, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K |journal=J.

Vitamin K is distributed differently within animals depending on its specific homologue. Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is mainly present in the liver, heart and pancreas, while MK-4 is better represented in the kidneys, brain and pancreas. The liver also contains longer chain homologues MK-7 to MK-13.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fusaro |first1=M |last2=Mereu |first2=MC |last3=Aghi |first3=A |last4=Iervasi |first4=G |last5=Gallieni |first5=M |title=Vitamin K and bone. |journal=Clinical Cases in Mineral and Bone Metabolism |date=May 2017 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=200–206 |doi=10.11138/ccmbm/2017.14.1.200 |pmid=29263734 |pmc=5726210 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The function of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> in the animal cell is to add a [[carboxylic acid]] [[functional group]] to a [[glutamate]] (Glu) [[amino acid]] residue in a [[protein]], to form a [[gamma-carboxyglutamate]] (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon [[posttranslational modification]] of the protein, which is then known as a [[Gla domain|"Gla protein"]]. The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to [[chelation|chelate]] [[calcium ion]]s. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K–dependent clotting factors discussed below.<ref name=InterPro/>

Within the cell, vitamin K participates in a cyclic process. The vitamin undergoes electron [[Redox|reduction]] to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone (quinol), catalyzed by the enzyme [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]] (VKOR).<ref name="Oldenburg">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oldenburg J, Bevans CG, Müller CR, Watzka M | title = Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1): the key protein of the vitamin K cycle | journal = Antioxidants & Redox Signaling | volume = 8 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 347–53 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16677080 | doi = 10.1089/ars.2006.8.347 }}</ref> Another enzyme then [[redox|oxidizes]] vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]]<ref name="Presnell">{{cite journal | vauthors = Presnell SR, Stafford DW | title = The vitamin K–dependent carboxylase | journal = Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 937–46 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12083499 | doi = 10.1055/s-0037-1613115 | s2cid = 27634025 }}</ref> or the vitamin K–dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then restored to vitamin K by VKOR.

Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The [[venom]] of a number of [[Snakes of Australia|Australian snakes]] acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the [[endothelium]] of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao VS, Joseph JS, Kini RM |title=Group D prothrombin activators from snake venom are structural homologues of mammalian blood coagulation factor Xa |journal=Biochem J |volume=369 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=635–42 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12403650 |doi=10.1042/BJ20020889 |pmc=1223123 }}</ref>

===Function in plants and cyanobacteria===
Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is an important chemical in green plants (including land plants and green algae) and some species of [[cyanobacteria]], where it functions as an [[electron acceptor]] transferring one electron in [[photosystem I]] during [[photosynthesis]].<ref name=Basset2017>{{cite journal |vauthors=Basset GJ, Latimer S, Fatihi A, Soubeyrand E, Block A |title=Phylloquinone (Vitamin K1): Occurrence, Biosynthesis and Functions |journal=Mini Rev Med Chem |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1028–38 |date=2017 |pmid=27337968 |doi=10.2174/1389557516666160623082714 }}</ref> For this reason, vitamin K<sub>1</sub> is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green [[leaf|leaves]], and dark green leafy vegetables such as [[romaine lettuce]], [[kale]], and [[spinach]]), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues.<ref name=USDA-VitK /><ref name=Basset2017 />

Detection of VKORC1 homologues active on the K<sub>1</sub>-epioxide suggest that K<sub>1</sub> may have a non-redox function in these organisms. In plants but not cyanobacteria, knockout of this gene show growth restriction similar to mutants lacking the ability to produce K<sub>1</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Oostende |first1=Chloë |last2=Widhalm |first2=Joshua R. |last3=Furt |first3=Fabienne |last4=Ducluzeau |first4=Anne-Lise |last5=Basset |first5=Gilles J. |title=Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone) |journal=Advances in Botanical Research |date=2011 |volume=59 |pages=229–261 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385853-5.00001-5 |isbn=9780123858535 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285136704}}</ref>

=== Function in other bacteria ===
Many bacteria, including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' found in the [[large intestine]], can synthesize vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (MK-7 up to MK-11),<ref name=Bentley>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bentley R, Meganathan R | title = Biosynthesis of vitamin K (menaquinone) in bacteria | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–80 | date = September 1982 | pmid = 6127606 | pmc = 281544 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.46.3.241-280.1982 }}</ref> but not vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. In the vitamin K<sub>2</sub> synthesizing bacteria, menaquinone transfers two [[electron]]s between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes ([[anaerobic respiration]]).<ref name=Haddock>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haddock BA, Jones CW | title = Bacterial respiration | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–99 | date = March 1977 | pmid = 140652 | pmc = 413996 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.41.1.47-99.1977 }}</ref> For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[formate]], or [[NADH]], with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such as [[fumarate]] or [[nitrate]] (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to [[fumarate]] or [[nitrate]] converts the molecule to [[succinate]] or [[nitrite]] plus [[water]], respectively.<ref name=Haddock /> 

Some of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], in a manner similar to [[eukaryotic]] cell [[aerobic respiration]], except the final electron acceptor is not [[molecular oxygen]], but [[fumarate]] or [[nitrate]]. In [[aerobic respiration]], the final oxidant is [[molecular oxygen]], which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as [[NADH]] to be converted to [[water]]. ''E. coli'', as [[facultative anaerobe]]s, can carry out both [[aerobic respiration]] and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.<ref name=Haddock />

The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as ''Koagulationsvitamin''.

For several decades, the vitamin K–deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K–deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K–containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), [[University of Iowa]] Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, [[Kenneth Brinkhous]], and Harry Pratt Smith), and the [[Mayo Clinic]] ([[Hugh Butt]], [[Albert Snell]], and Arnold Osterberg).<ref name="dam-nobel">{{cite web | vauthors = Dam CP |author-link=Carl Peter Henrik Dam| date = 12 December 1946 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1943/dam-lecture.pdf | title = The discovery of vitamin K, its biological functions and therapeutical application | work = Nobel Prize lecture }}</ref>

The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when [[prothrombin]], a blood coagulation protein, was confirmed to be vitamin K dependent. When the vitamin is present, prothrombin has amino acids near the amino terminus of the protein as [[γ-carboxyglutamate]] instead of [[glutamate]], and is able to bind calcium, part of the clotting process.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Stenflo J, Fernlund P, Egan W, Roepstorff P |title = Vitamin K dependent modifications of glutamic acid residues in prothrombin |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume = 71 | issue = 7 |pages = 2730–3 |date = July 1974 |pmid = 4528109 |pmc = 388542 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.71.7.2730|bibcode = 1974PNAS...71.2730S |doi-access = free }}</ref>
