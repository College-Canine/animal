'''Hypereosinophilic syndrome'''  is a disease characterized by a persistently [[Eosinophilia|elevated eosinophil count]] (≥ 1500 eosinophils/mm³) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the [[heart]], [[nervous system]], or [[bone marrow]].<ref name="pmid1090795">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chusid MJ, Dale DC, West BC, Wolff SM |s2cid=39212252 |title=The hypereosinophilic syndrome: analysis of fourteen cases with review of the literature |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |year=1975 |pmid=1090795 |doi=10.1097/00005792-197501000-00001|doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Depending on [[eosinophil]] target-organ infiltration, the clinical presentation of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) varies from patient to patient.<ref name="Orphanet">{{cite journal | last1=Roufosse | first1=Florence E | last2=Goldman | first2=Michel | last3=Cogan | first3=Elie | title=Hypereosinophilic syndromes | journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume=2 | issue=1 | date=2007 | issn=1750-1172 | pmid=17848188 | pmc=2045078 | doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-37 | doi-access=free | page=37}}</ref> Individuals with myeloproliferative variant HES may be more likely to experience mucosal ulcerations involving the genitalia or airways, while patients with lymphocytic variant HES typically exhibit prominent skin symptoms such as urticarial plaques, [[angioedema]], and [[erythroderma]].<ref name="Abnormal Clones">{{cite journal | last1=Simon | first1=Hans-Uwe | last2=Plötz | first2=Sabine Gisela | last3=Dummer | first3=Reinhard | last4=Blaser | first4=Kurt | title=Abnormal Clones of T Cells Producing Interleukin-5 in Idiopathic Eosinophilia | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society | volume=341 | issue=15 | date=October 7, 1999 | issn=0028-4793 | doi=10.1056/nejm199910073411503 | pages=1112–1120| pmid=10511609 }}</ref><ref name="Case presentation">{{cite journal | last1=Leiferman | first1=Kristin M. | last2=Gleich | first2=Gerald J. | title=Hypereosinophilic syndromeCase presentation and update | journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=113 | issue=1 | year=2004 | issn=0091-6749 | doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2003.10.051 | pages=50–58| pmid=14713907 }}</ref> Myeloproliferative variant HES is far more common in men and is typically linked to symptoms more typical of myeloproliferative disorders, including [[anemia]], [[splenomegaly]], [[hepatomegaly]], and fibrotic disease (particularly of the heart).<ref name="Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemias">{{cite journal | last1=Bain | first1=Barbara J. | last2=Fletcher | first2=Sarah H. | title=Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemias and the Myeloproliferative Variant of the Hypereosinophilic Syndrome | journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=27 | issue=3 | year=2007 | issn=0889-8561 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2007.06.001 | pages=377–388| pmid=17868855 }}</ref>

Patients can develop a range of nonspecific symptoms, including [[fever]], [[diarrhea]], rash, [[angioedema]], [[weakness]], [[Fatigue|exhaustion]], [[Cough|coughing]], and [[dyspnea]].<ref name="An update">{{cite journal | last1=Wilkins | first1=H.

The common and non-specific cutaneous manifestations are either erythematous, itchy [[Papule|papules]] and [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] that resemble [[eczema]], or urticarial and angioedematous lesions.<ref name="Orphanet"/> These types of lesions are frequently the main clinical consequence of [[Eosinophilia|hypereosinophilia]] in patients with lymphocytic-HES.<ref name="Abnormal Clones"/><ref name="Clonal Th2">{{cite journal | last1=Roufosse | first1=F. | last2=Schandené | first2=L. | last3=Sibille | first3=C. | last4=Willard-Gallo | first4=K. | last5=Kennes | first5=B. | last6=Efira | first6=A. | last7=Goldman | first7=M. | last8=Cogan | first8=E. | title=Clonal Th2 lymphocytes in patients with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome | journal=British Journal of Haematology | publisher=Wiley | volume=109 | issue=3 | year=2000 | issn=0007-1048 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02097.x | pages=540–548| pmid=10886202 }}</ref>

Cardiac involvement typically progresses through three phases. Rarely, the early necrotic stage involving the endo-myocardium manifests as acute [[heart failure]]. In most cases, however, there are no symptoms. A thrombotic stage ensues after this one, during which thrombi form in the cardiac chambers along the injured [[endocardium]] and may separate, resulting in peripheral emboli.<ref name="Orphanet"/> Endomyocardial fibrosis causes irreversible [[restrictive cardiomyopathy]] in the final stage of [[fibrosis]], and damage to the atrioventricular valves may cause more acute presentations of [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name="FAUCI 1982">{{cite journal | last=FAUCI | first=ANTHONY S. | title=The Idiopathic Hypereosinophilic Syndrome | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | publisher=American College of Physicians | volume=97 | issue=1 | date=July 1, 1982 | pages=78–92 | issn=0003-4819 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-97-1-78 | pmid=7046556 }}</ref>

Both the peripheral ([[polyneuropathy]]) and central (diffuse [[encephalopathy]]) nervous systems may be affected by neurological manifestations. Disorientation, memory loss, and altered behavior and cognitive function are the symptoms of diffuse [[encephalopathy]]. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathies can include mixed sensory and motor complaints, symmetric or asymmetric sensory alterations, or pure motor deficits. [[Stroke]] or brief ischemic episodes can happen after intracardiac thrombi have been embolised peripherally. In certain patients, procoagulant therapy may result in thrombosis of the intracranial veins (lateral sinus and/or longitudinal vein). This condition is linked to persistent [[hypereosinophilia]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

When there are no radiological abnormalities, lung involvement can vary from a persistent dry cough and/or bronchial hyperreactivity to restrictive disease with pulmonary infiltrates. There have been isolated reports of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] development. Chronic illness may lead to the development of [[pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

Hematological manifestations include [[thrombocytopenia]], [[anemia]], [[splenomegaly]], and [[hepatomegaly]]. Patients may occasionally exhibit mild [[lymphadenopathy]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

HES patients may experience coagulation problems. It is thought that long-term [[hypereosinophilia]] may both directly stimulate coagulation and damage the endovascular surface, which would explain [[peripheral vasculopathy]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

[[Abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] are a few examples of gastrointestinal symptoms. There may be [[colitis]], [[enterocolitis]], or eosinophilic gastritis; if eosinophilic infiltrates affect the intestinal wall's deeper layers, [[colitis]] may be linked to [[Ascites|ascitis]].<ref name="Orphanet"/>

== Causes ==
While some HES patients have [[eosinophilia]] in conjunction with known myeloid malignancies, others do not have a known malignancy but do have laboratory or [[bone marrow]] abnormalities, such as [[thrombocytopenia]], [[anemia]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], and [[eosinophil]]-related tissue damage and fibrosis, that are frequently associated with [[Myeloproliferative neoplasm|myeloproliferative disease]]. The diagnosis of myeloproliferative HES is made for these individuals.<ref name="Curtis 2016">{{cite journal | last1=Curtis | first1=Casey | last2=Ogbogu | first2=Princess | title=Hypereosinophilic Syndrome | journal=Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume=50 | issue=2 | date=2016 | issn=1080-0549 | doi=10.1007/s12016-015-8506-7 | pages=240–251| pmid=26475367 | s2cid=8366863 }}</ref>

[[Eosinophilia]] in lymphocytic HES is caused by populations of activated [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] producing more eosinophil hematopoietins, specifically [[Interleukin 5|interleukin-5]] (IL-5).<ref name="Curtis 2016"/>

Severe [[eosinophilia]] with an unknown etiology that manifests in successive generations is known as [[Familial eosinophilia|familial hypereosinophilia]] syndrome (HES).<ref name="Curtis 2016"/>

== Mechanism ==
It is possible that several mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of HES because of the clinical heterogeneity of its patients.<ref name="An update" />

Despite the lack of knowledge regarding the precise mechanism underlying eosinophil-induced tissue damage, [[eosinophil]] accumulation seems to have pathological outcomes.<ref name="An update" /> [[Eosinophil]]s cause direct [[cytotoxicity]] by releasing harmful substances locally, such as enzymes, pro-inflammatory [[Cytokine|cytokines]], reactive oxygen species, cationic proteins, and factors derived from [[arachidonic acid]].<ref name="Revisited" /><ref name="Gleich 2000 pp. 651–663">{{cite journal | last=Gleich | first=Gerald J. | title=Mechanisms of eosinophil-associated inflammation | journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=105 | issue=4 | year=2000 | issn=0091-6749 | doi=10.1067/mai.2000.105712 | pages=651–663| pmid=10756213 }}</ref> The extent of end-organ damage varies, and the severity of organ damage is frequently unrelated to the degree or duration of [[eosinophilia]].<ref name="The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome" />

== Diagnosis ==
Numerous techniques are used to diagnose hypereosinophilic syndrome, of which the most important is blood testing. In HES, the [[eosinophil]] count is greater than 1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. On some smears the eosinophils may appear normal in appearance, but morphologic abnormalities, such as a lowering of granule numbers and size, can be observed. Roughly 50% of patients with HES also have [[anaemia]].<ref name="emedicine"/>

Secondly, various imaging and diagnostic technological methods are utilised to detect defects to the heart and other organs, such as valvular dysfunction and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s by means of [[echocardiography]]. Chest radiographs may indicate pleural effusions and/or [[fibrosis]],<ref name="emedicine"/> and neurological tests such as [[CT Scan|CT scans]] can show strokes and increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] pressure.<ref name="emedicine"/>

A proportion of patients have a mutation involving the ''[[PDGFRA]]'' and ''[[FIP1L1]]'' genes on [[chromosome 4 (human)|the fourth chromosome]], leading to a [[tyrosine kinase]] [[fusion protein]]. Testing for this mutation is now routine practice, as its presence indicates a likely response to [[imatinib]], a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid12660384">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cools J, DeAngelo DJ, Gotlib J, etal |title=A tyrosine kinase created by fusion of the PDGFRA and FIP1L1 genes as a therapeutic target of imatinib in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome |journal=N.

# Organ dysfunction or damage as a result of [[Eosinophil|eosinophils]]' toxic contents being released locally.<ref name="fourteen cases"/>
Since there isn't a particular diagnostic test for HES, the syndrome is diagnosed by exclusion.<ref name="An update" /> Differential diagnosis includes [[Drug hypersensitivity|drug hypersensitivity reactions]], [[Parasitism|parasitic infections]], [[Sarcoidosis|sarcoid]], advanced [[HIV]] infection, [[inflammatory bowel disease]], lymphoid [[Neoplasm|neoplasms]], and [[autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome]].<ref name="Current Approach">{{cite journal | last=Klion | first=Amy | title=Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: Current Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment | journal=Annual Review of Medicine | volume=60 | issue=1 | date=2009-02-01 | issn=0066-4219 | doi=10.1146/annurev.med.60.062107.090340 | pages=293–306| pmid=19630574 }}</ref>

=== Classification ===
Myeloproliferative HES (M-HES) and lymphocytic HES (L-HES) are the two main categories of HES, along with a few other clearly defined clinical entities.<ref name="Curtis 2016" />

== Treatment ==
As a first-line treatment for HES patients' symptoms, [[Corticosteroid|corticosteroids]] are recommended.<ref name="An update" /> Because high-dose [[prednisone]] rapidly lowers eosinophil levels, it is usually started at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day.<ref name="The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome" /> Upon achieving appropriate control over [[eosinophilia]], the medication can be gradually reduced.<ref name="Portico 1998 p. 361">{{cite journal | title=The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome: Clinical presentation, pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies | journal=Drugs of Today | publisher=Portico | volume=34 | issue=4 | year=1998 | issn=1699-4019 | doi=10.1358/dot.1998.34.4.485234 | last1=Roufosse, f. | pmid=15010724 | last2=Bartholomé | first2=E. | last3=Schandené | first3=L. | last4=Goldman | first4=M. | last5=Cogan | first5=E. | pages=361–373 }}</ref>

Steroid-refractory HES has been managed with a variety of cytotoxic treatments.<ref name="Current Approach"/> Out of all of them, [[hydroxyurea]] has been researched the most and has been linked to few side effects at doses as high as 2 g per day.<ref name="PARRILLO 1978 p. 167">{{cite journal | last=PARRILLO | first=JOSEPH E. | title=Therapy of the Hypereosinophilic Syndrome | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | publisher=American College of Physicians | volume=89 | issue=2 | date=August 1, 1978 | pages=167–172 | issn=0003-4819 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-89-2-167 | pmid=677578 }}</ref>

It has been demonstrated that [[Immunotherapy|immunomodulatory drugs]], such as [[interferon-alpha]], [[cyclosporine]], and [[Immunoglobulin therapy|intravenous immunoglobulin]], that influence Th2 cytokine production and [[T cell]] proliferation can be therapeutically effective in HES.<ref name="Butterfield 2007 pp. 493–518">{{cite journal | last=Butterfield | first=Joseph H. | title=Treatment of Hypereosinophilic Syndromes with Prednisone, Hydroxyurea, and Interferon | journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=27 | issue=3 | year=2007 | issn=0889-8561 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2007.06.003 | pages=493–518| pmid=17868861 }}</ref>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved [[imatinib mesylate]], a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]], as the first treatment for HES.<ref name="Current Approach"/>

An option for patients who have not responded to conventional treatment regimens is a [[stem cell transplant]].<ref name="Curtis 2016" />

== Outlook ==
The prognosis for HES was extremely poor when the syndrome was first described; however, due to a variety of factors, including earlier detection of complications, improved surgical management of cardiac and valvular disease, and the use of a wider range of therapeutic molecules to control [[hypereosinophilia]], the prognosis has steadily and significantly improved over time.<ref name="Orphanet" />

Patients without [[chronic heart failure]] and those who respond well to pharmaceutical treatments have a good [[prognosis]]. However, the mortality rate rises in patients with [[anaemia]], [[chromosome abnormalities]] or a [[leukocytosis|very high white blood cell count]].<ref name="emedicine" />

== Epidemiology ==
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) estimated the prevalence of HES at the time of granting [[Orphan_drug#Europe|orphan drug]] designation for HES in 2004 at 1.5 in 100,000 people, corresponding to a current case load of about 8,000 in the EU, 5,000 in the U.S., and 2,000 in Japan.<ref>European Medicines Agency, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.

== History ==
In 1968, the term "hypereosinophilic syndrome" was created to group patients who had several closely related conditions that were all marked by persistently elevated peripheral blood [[eosinophil]] levels and organ damage from eosinophilic infiltration.<ref name="HARDY 1968">{{cite journal | last=HARDY | first=WILLIAM R. | title=The Hypereosinophilic Syndromes | journal=Annals of Internal Medicine | publisher=American College of Physicians | volume=68 | issue=6 | date=June 1, 1968 | pages=1220–1229 | issn=0003-4819 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-68-6-1220 | pmid=5653621 }}</ref>
