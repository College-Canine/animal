'''Pythiosis''' is a rare and deadly [[tropical disease]] caused by the [[oomycete]] ''[[Pythium insidiosum]]''. Long regarded as being caused by a fungus, the causative agent was not discovered until 1987. It occurs most commonly in horses, dogs, and humans, with isolated cases in other large mammals.<ref name="pmid19494087">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jindayok T, Piromsontikorn S, Srimuang S, Khupulsup K, Krajaejun T |title=Hemagglutination Test for Rapid Serodiagnosis of Human Pythiosis |journal=Clin. Vaccine Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=1047–51 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19494087 |pmc=2708401 |doi=10.1128/CVI.00113-09 }}</ref>  The disease is contracted after exposure to stagnant fresh water such as swamps, ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. ''P. insidiosum'' is different from other members of the genus in that human and horse hair, skin, and decaying animal and plant tissue are [[chemoattractant]]s for its [[zoospore]]s.<ref name="Liljebjelke"/> Additionally, it is the only member in the genus known to infect mammals, while other members are pathogenic to plants and are responsible for some well-known plant diseases.

==Epidemiology==
Pythiosis occurs in areas with mild winters because the organism survives in standing water that does not reach freezing temperatures.<ref name="Helman">{{cite journal |vauthors=Helman R, Oliver J |title=Pythiosis of the digestive tract in dogs from Oklahoma |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=111–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10102178 |doi=10.5326/15473317-35-2-111}}</ref> In the United States, it is most commonly found in the Southern Gulf states, especially [[Louisiana]], [[Florida]], and [[Texas]], but has also been reported as far away as [[California]] and [[Wisconsin]].<ref>Gastrointestinal pythiosis in 10 dogs from California.

Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, University of California, School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, CA, USA. 
</ref> It is also found in [[southeast Asia]], eastern [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South America]].

==Pathophysiology==
Pythiosis is suspected to be caused by invasion of the organism into wounds, either in the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="Helman"/> The disease grows slowly in the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]], eventually forming large lumps of [[granulation tissue]]. It can also invade surrounding [[lymph node]]s.

==In different animals==
The species are listed in decreasing frequency of infection.

===Horses===

In horses, [[subcutis|subcutaneous]] pythiosis is the most common form and infection occurs through a wound while standing in water containing the pathogen.<ref name="Liljebjelke">{{cite journal |vauthors=Liljebjelke K, Abramson C, Brockus C, Greene C |title=Duodenal obstruction caused by infection with Pythium insidiosum in a 12-week-old puppy |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=220 |issue=8 |pages=1188–91, 1162 |year=2002 |pmid=11990966 |doi=10.2460/javma.2002.220.1188|doi-access=free }}</ref>  The disease is also known as '''leeches''', '''swamp cancer''', and '''bursatti'''. Lesions are most commonly found on the lower limbs, abdomen, chest, and [[Horse anatomy#Reproductive system|genitals]].  They are [[granuloma]]tous and itchy, and may be ulcerated or [[fistula]]ted.  The lesions often contain yellow, firm masses of dead tissue known as 'kunkers'.<ref name="Merck_oo">{{cite web | title=Oomycosis | work=The Merck Veterinary Manual | year=2006 | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/51112.htm | access-date=2007-02-03 }}</ref> It is possible with chronic infection for the disease to spread to underlying bone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Worster A, Lillich J, Cox J, Rush B |title=Pythiosis with bone lesions in a pregnant mare |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=216 |issue=11 |pages=1795–8, 1760 |year=2000 |pmid=10844973 |doi=10.2460/javma.2000.216.1795|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Dogs===

Pythiosis of the skin in dogs is rare, and appears as [[Skin ulcer|ulcerated]] lumps. Primary infection can also occur in the bones and lungs. Dogs with the gastrointestinal form of pythiosis have severe thickening of one or more portions of the gastrointestinal tract that may include the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, or in rare cases, even the esophagus. The resulting pathology results in anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), and abdominal straining. Extensive weight loss may be evident.<ref>Dr. Susan Muller, DVM. http://www.critterology.com/articles/pythiosis-dog {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417235003/http://www.critterology.com/articles/pythiosis-dog |date=2010-04-17 }}</ref>

===Cats and other animals===

In cats, pythioisis is almost always confined to the skin as hairless and edematous lesions. It is usually found on the limbs, [[perineum]], and at the base of the tail.<ref name="Wolf_2005">{{cite book|editor=August, John R.|chapter=Opportunistic fungal infections|author=Wolf, Alice|title=Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine Vol. 5|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7216-0423-7}}</ref>  Lesions may also develop in the [[nasopharynx]].<ref name="Merck_oo"/> Rabbits are susceptible to pythiosis and are used for ''in vivo'' studies of the disease.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}
Other animals reported to have contracted pythiosis are bears, jaguars, camels, and birds, although these have only been singular events.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==Diagnosis and treatment==

Pythiosis is suspected to be heavily underdiagnosed due to unfamiliarity with the disease, the rapid progression and morbidity, and the difficulty in making a diagnosis. Symptoms often appear once the disease has progressed to the point where treatments are less effective. 
As the organism is neither a bacterium, virus, nor fungus, routine tests often fail to diagnose it. In cytology and histology, the organism does not stain using [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], H&E, or Diff-Quick, but the hyphae are outlined by surrounding tissue. [[Grocott's methenamine silver stain|GMS staining]] is required to identify the hyphae in slides, and highlights the lack of septation which helps distinguish the organism from fungal hyphae. Granulomatous inflammation with numerous eosinophils is suggestive that the hyphae are oomycetes rather than fungi, which are less likely to attract eosinophils.  The symptoms are usually nonspecific and the disease may not be included in a differential diagnosis in human medicine, though it is familiar to veterinarians.

Biopsies of infected tissues are known to be difficult to culture, but can help narrow the diagnosis to several different organisms. A definite diagnosis is confirmed using [[ELISA]] testing of serum for pythiosis antibodies, or by [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing of infected tissues or cultures.

Due to the poor efficacy of single treatments, pythiosis infections are often treated using a variety of different treatments, all with varying success.  Most successful treatments include surgery, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.<ref name="Permpalung" />

Aggressive surgical resection is the treatment of choice for pythiosis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thieman KM, Kirkby KA, Flynn-Lurie A, etal | year = 2011 | title = Diagnosis and treatment of truncal cutaneous pythiosis in a dog | journal = J Am Vet Med Assoc | volume = 239 | issue = 9| pages = 1232–1235 | doi=10.2460/javma.239.9.1232| pmid = 21999797 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Because it provides the best opportunity for cure, complete excision of infected tissue should be pursued whenever possible. When cutaneous lesions are limited to a single distal extremity, amputation is often recommended. In animals with gastrointestinal pythiosis, segmental lesions should be resected with 5-cm margins whenever possible. Unfortunately, surgical excision of tissue and amputation do not guarantee complete success and lesions can reappear. So, surgery is often followed by other treatments.<ref name="Permpalung" />

An immunotherapy product derived from antigens of ''P. insidiosum'' has been used successfully to treat pythiosis.<ref>Grooters AM, Foil CS.  Miscellaneous fungal infections.  In:  Greene CE, ed.
