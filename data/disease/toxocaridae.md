The '''Toxocaridae''' are a [[zoonotic]] [[family (biology)|family]] of [[parasitic]] [[nematode]]s that infect [[canid]]s and [[felid]]s and which cause [[toxocariasis]] in humans ([[visceral larva migrans]] and ocular larva migrans).<ref name=Fan2015>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fan CK, Holland CV, Loxton K, Barghouth U |title=Cerebral Toxocariasis: Silent Progression to Neurodegenerative Disorders?|volume=28|issue=3|pages=663–86|date=July 2015|pmid=26062575|doi=10.1128/CMR.00106-14|journal=Clin Microbiol Rev|pmc=4462679}}</ref> The worms are unable to reproduce in humans.

Notable species include:
*''[[Toxocara canis]]'', which infects dogs. 
*''[[Toxocara cati]]'', which infects cats and lacks intermediate hosts.
*''[[Toxascaris leonina]]'', which infects mostly cats, but also dogs.

==Infection==
Infection by ''T. canis'' or ''T. cati'' can cause various clinical manifestations.  One of these is visceral larva migrans, wherein the larvae are unable to develop in humans as they do in cats and dogs, their natural hosts.  Arrested development leaves the larvae to wander aimlessly in the body, causing inflammation, most commonly in the [[liver]] and [[lung]]s.

[[Egg (biology)|Eggs]] are introduced into the body through ingestion. This can occur when eggs are deposited on the hands or face, after handling infected dogs or cats. In some cases, they can also get them from undercooked meat. In children without exposure to animals, eggs can be introduced by directly ingesting egg-contaminated soil while playing in a yard or on a playground. Usually, the scenario involves a young child with a new puppy. Unfortunately, many young children who have been infected with these larvae, causing ocular larva migrans in the [[eye]], have been misdiagnosed to have [[retinoblastoma]] and have had their [[enucleation of the eye|eyes erroneously removed]].

==Diagnosis==
Direct identification of larvae in human disease is not feasible, so the diagnosis relies on history supported by serologic [[ELISA]] assay. The most sensitive assay, called excretory/secretory (E/S), contains 96 immunogenic antigens isolated from cultured ''T. canis'' larvae.

== Prevention ==
A number of products supplied by [[veterinarian]]s can prevent or treat infections with this parasite.  A great deal of information on this subject can be found on the computer sites maintained by the [[Companion Animal Parasite Council]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Treatment ==
Visceral toxocariasis in humans (or dogs) can be treated with antiparasitic drugs such as [[albendazole]] or [[mebendazole]], usually in combination with anti-inflammatory medications. Treatment for ocular larva migrans is to kill the larvae with a laser to prevent further damage, although some loss of vision in the affected eye is irreversible.

==Association with asthma==
Infection with ''Toxocara'' has been shown to stimulate [[Atopy|atopic]] disease, specifically asthma.<ref name="Holland 2006">Holland, Celia, and H. V. Smith. Toxocara: The Enigmatic Parasite. Wallingford, UK: CABI Pub., 2006. Print.</ref> Infection with this parasite causes asthma-like symptoms  such as accumulation of [[eosinophil]]s, an inflammatory response, and production of [[IgE]], the immunoglobulins associated with allergic responses.<ref>Pinelli, E., J. Dormans, and I. Van Die. "Toxocara and Asthma." Toxocara: The Enigmatic Parasite (n.d.): 42-57. Web.</ref> People with asthma are shown to have a higher prevalence of ''Toxocara'' [[seropositivity]].<ref>Cobzaru, RG, C. Rîpă, MM Leon, MC Luca, A. Ivan, and M. Luca. "Result Filters."

Web. 02 Oct. 2016.</ref> Research suggests that the IgE production stimulated by infection with ''Toxocara'' may contribute to the onsets of allergic asthma in children.<ref name="Holland 2006"/> The effects of how parasite load, frequency of exposure, and influence of genetics affect this relationship between ''Toxocara'' infection and allergic asthma are still unknown, yet important in understanding how to prevent asthma and other atopic diseases around the globe.<ref name="Holland 2006"/>
