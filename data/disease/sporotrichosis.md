==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Sporotrichosis by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii PHIL 3940 lores.jpg|thumb|Sporotrichosis by the fungus ''Sporothrix schenckii'']]
* ''Cutaneous or skin sporotrichosis''
:This is the most common form of this disease.  Symptoms of this form include nodular [[lesion]]s or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along [[lymph]] nodes and vessels.  The lesion starts off small and painless, and ranges in color from pink to purple.  Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a [[boil]] and more lesions will appear, until a chronic [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]] develops.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

:Usually, cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger, hand, and arm.{{cn|date=January 2023}}
* ''Pulmonary sporotrichosis''
:This rare form of the disease occur when ''S. schenckii'' spores are inhaled.  Symptoms of [[pulmonary]] sporotrichosis include productive [[cough]]ing, nodules and cavitations of the lungs, [[fibrosis]], and swollen [[Hilum of lung|hilar]] [[lymph node]]s.  Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing [[tuberculosis]] and [[pneumonia]]{{cn|date=January 2023}}
* ''Disseminated sporotrichosis''
:When the infection spreads from the initial site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into an uncommon and potentially life-threatening form, called [[Disseminated disease|disseminated]] sporotrichosis.  The infection can spread to joints and bones (called ''osteoarticular sporotrichosis'') as well as the [[central nervous system]] and the brain (called ''sporotrichosis meningitis'').{{cn|date=January 2023}}

:Some symptoms of disseminated sporotrichosis include weight loss, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and bone lesions.

===Complications===

Open sporotrichosis lesions on the skin will on occasion become [[superinfection|superinfected]] with bacteria.<ref name="konemans">{{Cite book

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Conidiophores and conidia of the fungus Sporothrix schenckii PHIL 4208 lores.jpg|thumb|Conidiophores and conidia of the fungus ''Sporothrix schenckii'']]
Sporotrichosis is an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] infection with slow progression and often subtle symptoms. It is often difficult to diagnose, as many other diseases share similar symptoms and therefore must be ruled out.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Patients with sporotrichosis will have [[antibodies]] against the fungus ''S. schenckii''; however, due to variability in sensitivity and specificity, antibody detection may not be a reliable diagnostic test for this disease.  The confirming diagnosis remains [[Microbiological culture|culturing]] the fungus from the skin, [[sputum]], [[synovial fluid]], and [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. [[smear test|Smears]] should be taken from any draining [[fistula]]s or ulcers.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Cats with sporotrichosis are unique in that the [[exudate]] from their lesions may contain numerous infectious organisms. This makes cytological evaluation of exudate a valuable diagnostic tool in this species. Exudate is [[pyogenic granuloma|pyogranuloma]]tous, and [[phagocyte|phagocytic cells]] may be packed with [[Yeast#Pathogenic_yeasts|yeast forms]]. These yeast cells are variable in size; many are cigar-shaped.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

===Differential diagnosis===
Differential diagnoses includes: [[leishmaniasis]], [[nocardiosis]], [[mycobacterium marinum]],<ref name="James2020"/> [[cat-scratch disease]], [[leprosy]], [[syphilis]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Milner2020"/>

==Prevention==
The majority of sporotrichosis cases occur when the fungus is introduced through a cut or puncture in the skin while handling vegetation containing the fungal spores.  Prevention of this disease includes wearing long sleeves and gloves while working with soil, hay bales, rose bushes, pine seedlings, and sphagnum moss.

The risk of sporotrichosis in cats is increased in male cats that roam outdoors.<ref name="saunders-small"/> Accordingly, the risk may be reduced by keeping cats indoors or neutering them.<ref name="sykes-2013">{{Cite book

==Treatment==
Treatment of sporotrichosis depends on the severity and location of the disease.  The following are treatment options for this condition:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lortholary O, Denning DW, Dupont B | title = Endemic mycoses: a treatment update | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–31 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10223586 | doi = 10.1093/jac/43.3.321 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* Oral [[potassium iodide]]
:Potassium iodide is an anti-fungal drug that is widely used as a treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis. Despite its wide use, there is no high-quality evidence for or against this practice. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral potassium iodide in the treatment of sporotrichosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue S, Gu R, Wu T, Zhang M, Wang X | title = Oral potassium iodide for the treatment of sporotrichosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD006136 | date = October 2009 | volume = 2009 | pmid = 19821356 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006136.pub2 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD006136/SKIN_oral-potassium-iodide-for-the-treatment-of-sporotrichosis | pmc = 7388325 }}</ref>
* [[Itraconazole]] (Sporanox) and [[fluconazole]]
:These are [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] drugs.  Itraconazole is currently the drug of choice and is significantly more effective than fluconazole. Fluconazole should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate itraconazole.
* [[Amphotericin B]]
:This antifungal medication is delivered intravenously.  Many patients, however, cannot tolerate Amphotericin B due to its potential side effects of fever, nausea, and vomiting.
:Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are usually recommended instead of [[amphotericin B deoxycholate]] because of a better adverse-effect profile. Amphotericin B can be used for severe infection during pregnancy. For children with disseminated or severe disease, amphotericin B deoxycholate can be used initially, followed by itraconazole.<ref name="dbt.consultantlive.com">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hogan BK, Hospenthal DR | title = Update on the therapy for sporotrichosis | journal = Patient Care | date = March 2011 | volume = 22 | pages = 49–52 | url = https://www.patientcareonline.com/hiv-aids/update-therapy-sporotrichosis | access-date = 2019-05-05 | archive-date = 2020-05-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200522230000/https://www.patientcareonline.com/hiv-aids/update-therapy-sporotrichosis | url-status = dead }}</ref>

:In case of sporotrichosis meningitis, the patient may be given a combination of Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine/[[Flucytosine]].
* [[Terbinafine]]
:500mg and 1000mg daily dosages of terbinafine for twelve to 24 weeks has been used to treat cutaneous sporotrichosis.<ref name="ncbi.nih.gov chapman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman SW, Pappas P, Kauffmann C, Smith EB, Dietze R, Tiraboschi-Foss N, Restrepo A, Bustamante AB, Opper C, Emady-Azar S, Bakshi R | title = Comparative evaluation of the efficacy and safety of two doses of terbinafine (500 and 1000 mg day(-1)) in the treatment of cutaneous or lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis | journal = Mycoses | volume = 47 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 62–8 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14998402 | doi = 10.1046/j.1439-0507.2003.00953.x| hdl = 2027.42/74074 | s2cid = 7319396 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>
* Newer [[triazole]]s
:Several studies have shown that [[posaconazole]] has in vitro activity similar to that of amphotericin B and itraconazole; therefore, it shows promise as an alternative therapy. However, [[voriconazole]] susceptibility varies. Because the correlation between in vitro data and clinical response has not been demonstrated, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either posaconazole or voriconazole for treatment of sporotrichosis at this time.<ref name="dbt.consultantlive.com"/>
* [[Surgery]]
:In cases of bone infection and cavitary nodules in the lungs, surgery may be necessary.
* [[Thermotherapy|Heat therapy]]
:Heat creates higher tissue temperatures, which may inhibit fungus growth while the immune system counteracts the infection. The "pocket warmer" used for this purpose has the advantage of being able to maintain a constant temperature of 44 degrees-45 degrees C on the skin surface for several hours, while permitting unrestricted freedom of movement.  The duration of treatment depends on the type of lesion, location, depth, and size. Generally, local application for 1-2 h per day, or in sleep time, for 5-6 weeks seems to be sufficient.<ref name="pmid7298332">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi S, Masahashi T, Maie O | title = [Local thermotherapy in sporotrichosis] | language = de | journal = Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift für Dermatologie, Venerologie, und Verwandte Gebiete | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 525–8 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 7298332 }}</ref>
