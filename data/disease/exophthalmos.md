'''Exophthalmos''' (also called '''exophthalmus''', '''exophthalmia''', '''proptosis''', or '''exorbitism''') is a bulging of the [[human eye|eye]] anteriorly out of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].  Exophthalmos can be either bilateral (as is often seen in [[Graves' disease]]) or unilateral (as is often seen in an orbital tumor). Complete or partial dislocation from the orbit is also possible from trauma or swelling of surrounding tissue resulting from trauma.

In the case of Graves' disease, the displacement of the eye results from abnormal connective tissue deposition in the orbit and [[extraocular muscles]], which can be visualized by [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]].<ref name=Epstein>{{cite book|author1=Owen Epstein |author2=David Perkin |author3=John Cookson |author4=David P de Bono |title=Clinical examination |edition=3rd|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis|date=April 2003|isbn=0-7234-3229-5}}</ref>

If left untreated, exophthalmos can cause the eyelids to fail to close during sleep, leading to [[cornea]]l dryness and damage. Another possible complication is a form of redness or irritation called [[superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis]], in which the area above the cornea becomes inflamed as a result of increased friction when blinking. The process that is causing the displacement of the eye may also compress the [[optic nerve]] or [[ophthalmic artery]], and lead to [[blindness]].

==Anatomy==
{{see also|Anatomical terms of location}}
Proptosis is the anterior displacement of the eye from the orbit.  Since the orbit is closed off posteriorly, medially and laterally, any enlargement of structures located within will cause the anterior displacement of the eye.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Richard N|title=Pocket companion to Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-5454-2|chapter=Eye|date=2011|edition=8th}}</ref>  Swelling or enlargement of the lacrimal gland causes inferior medial and anterior dislocation of the eye.  This is because the lacrimal glands are located superiorly and laterally in the orbit.<ref name=Robbins />

==Diagnosis==
=== Measurement ===
Measurement of the degree of exophthalmos is performed using an [[exophthalmometer]].

Most sources define exophthalmos/proptosis as a protrusion of the globe greater than 18&nbsp;mm.<ref name=Epstein />

The term exophthalmos is often used when describing proptosis associated with [[Graves' disease]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1218575|Exophthalmos (Proptosis)}}</ref>

==Animals==
[[Image:Exophthalmos in pug.JPG|thumb|Exophthalmos in a Pug]]
Exophthalmos is commonly found in [[dog]]s.  It is seen in [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]] (short-nosed) dog breeds because of the shallow [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].  It can lead to [[keratitis]] secondary to exposure of the [[cornea]].  Exophthalmos is commonly seen in the [[pug]], [[Boston terrier]], [[Pekingese]], and [[shih tzu]]. It is a common result of [[head trauma]] and pressure exerted on the front of the neck too hard in dogs. In cats, eye proptosis is uncommon and is often accompanied by facial fractures.<ref>{{cite web | title = Prolapse of the Eye | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30119.htm | access-date = 2007-03-23 }}</ref>

About 40% of proptosed eyes retain vision after being replaced in the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]], but in cats very few retain vision.<ref>{{cite conference | last = Gelatt | first = Kirk | title = Treatment of Orbital Diseases in Small Animals | conference = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2641 | access-date = 2007-03-23 }}</ref>   Replacement of the eye requires general [[anesthesia]].  The eyelids are pulled outward, and the eye is gently pushed back into place.  The eyelids are sewn together in a procedure known as [[tarsorrhaphy]] for about five days to keep the eye in place.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book |editor1-last=Gelatt |editor1-first=Kirk N. |title=Veterinary Ophthalmology |date=1999 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=978-0-683-30076-5 }}{{page needed|date=February 2023}}</ref>  Replaced eyes have a higher rate of [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] and [[keratitis]] and often require lifelong treatment.  If the damage is severe, the eye is removed in a relatively simple [[surgery]] known as [[enucleation of the eye]].

The [[prognosis]] for a replaced eye is determined by the extent of damage to the [[cornea]] and [[sclera]], the presence or absence of a [[pupillary light reflex]], and the presence of ruptured [[muscles of orbit|rectus muscle]]s.  The rectus muscles normally help hold the eye in place and direct eye movement.  Rupture of more than two rectus muscles usually requires the eye to be removed, because significant blood vessel and nerve damage also usually occurs.<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>  Compared to brachycephalic breeds, dochilocephalic (long-nosed) breeds usually have more trauma to the eye and its surrounding structures, so the prognosis is worse.<ref>{{cite conference | last = Bjerk | first = Ellen | title = Ocular Injuries in General Practice | conference = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8722&O=Generic | access-date = 2007-03-23 }}</ref>
