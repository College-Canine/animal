'''Vasculitis''' is a group of disorders that destroy [[blood vessel]]s by [[inflammation]].<ref name="urlGlossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ">{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html |title=Glossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ |access-date=2009-01-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220232449/http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html |archive-date=2008-12-20 }}</ref> Both [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s are affected. [[Lymphangitis]] (inflammation of [[lymphatic vessel]]s) is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000114505|Vasculitis}}</ref> Vasculitis is primarily caused by [[white blood cell|leukocyte]] migration and resultant damage. Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins ([[phlebitis]]) or arteries ([[arteritis]]) on their own are separate entities.

== Causes ==
There are several different etiologies for vasculitides. Although infections usually involve vessels as a component of more extensive tissue damage, they can also directly or indirectly cause vasculitic syndromes through immune-mediated secondary events. Simple [[Thrombosis|vascular thrombosis]] usually only affects the luminal process, but through the process of thrombus organization, it can also occasionally cause a more chronic vasculitic syndrome. The [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] etiologies, a particular family of diseases characterized by dysregulated immune responses that produce particular pathophysiologic signs and symptoms, are more prevalent.<ref name="Pathobiology of Human Disease">{{cite book | last=Seidman | first=M.A. | title=Pathobiology of Human Disease | chapter=Vasculitis | publisher=Elsevier | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-12-386457-4 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-386456-7.05506-4 | pages=2995–3005}}</ref>

== Classification ==
Primary systemic, secondary, and single-organ vasculitis are distinguished using the highest classification level in the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus">{{cite journal | last1=Jennette | first1=J. C. | last2=Falk | first2=R. J. | last3=Bacon | first3=P. A. | last4=Basu | first4=N. | last5=Cid | first5=M. C. | last6=Ferrario | first6=F. | last7=Flores-Suarez | first7=L.

=== Primary systemic vasculitis ===
{{main|Systemic vasculitis}}
[[Systemic vasculitis|Primary systemic vasculitis]] is catogized by the size of the vessels mainly involved. Primary systemic vasculitis includes large-vessel vasculitis, medium-vessel vasculitis, small-vessel vasculitis, and variable-vessel vasculitis.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

==== Large vessel vasculitis ====
The 2012 [[Chapel Hill Consensus Conference]] defines large vessel vasculitis (LVV) as a type of vasculitis that can affect any size artery, but it usually affects the aorta and its major branches more frequently than other vasculitides.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/> [[Takayasu's arteritis|Takayasu arteritis]] (TA) and [[giant cell arteritis]] (GCA) are the two main forms of LVV.<ref name="Overview of the 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus">{{cite journal | last=Jennette | first=J. Charles | title=Overview of the 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature of vasculitides | journal=Clinical and Experimental Nephrology | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=17 | issue=5 | date=September 27, 2013 | issn=1342-1751 | doi=10.1007/s10157-013-0869-6 | pages=603–606| pmid=24072416 | pmc=4029362 }}</ref>

==== Medium vessel vasculitis ====
Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV) is a type of vasculitis that mostly affects the medium arteries, which are the major arteries that supply the viscera and their branches. Any size artery could be impacted, though.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/> The two primary types are [[polyarteritis nodosa]] (PAN) and [[Kawasaki disease]] (KD).<ref name="Overview of the 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

==== Small vessel vasculitis ====
Small vessel vasculitis (SVV) is separated into immune complex SVV and [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody]] (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

[[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody]] (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a [[necrotizing vasculitis]] linked to MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA that primarily affects small vessels and has few or no immune deposits. AAV is further classified as [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (Churg-Strauss) (EGPA), [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (Wegener's) (GPA), and [[microscopic polyangiitis]] (MPA).<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

Immune complex small vessel vasculitis (SVV) is vasculitis that primarily affects small vessels and has moderate to significant [[immunoglobulin]] and complement component deposits on the vessel wall.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/> Normocomplementemic [[urticarial vasculitis]] (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis), [[cryoglobulinemic vasculitis]] (CV), [[IgA vasculitis]] (Henoch-Schönlein) (IgAV), and [[Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease|anti-glomerular basement membrane]] (anti-GBM) disease are the categories of immune complex SVV.<ref name="Overview of the 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

==== Variable vessel vasculitis ====
Variable vessel vasculitis (VVV) is a kind of vasculitis that may impact vessels of all sizes (small, medium, and large) and any type (arteries, veins, and capillaries), with no particular type of vessel being predominantly affected.<ref name="Chapel Hill Consensus"/> This category includes [[Behçet's disease|Behcet's disease]] (BD) and [[Cogan syndrome|Cogan's syndrome]] (CS).<ref name="Overview of the 2012 revised International Chapel Hill Consensus"/>

=== Secondary vasculitis ===
The subset of illnesses known as secondary vasculitis are those believed to be brought on by an underlying ailment or exposure. Systemic illnesses (such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), cancer, drug exposure, and infection are the primary causes of vasculitis; however, there are still few factors that have a conclusively shown pathogenic relationship to the condition.<ref name="Classification and classification criteria">{{cite journal | last1=Mahr | first1=Alfred | last2=de Menthon | first2=Mathilde | title=Classification and classification criteria for vasculitis | journal=Current Opinion in Rheumatology | publisher=Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | volume=27 | issue=1 | year=2015 | issn=1040-8711 | doi=10.1097/bor.0000000000000134 | pages=1–9| pmid=25415531 | s2cid=24318541 }}</ref> Vasculitis frequently coexists with infections, and several infections, including [[hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]], [[HIV]], [[infective endocarditis]], and [[tuberculosis]], are significant secondary causes of vasculitis.<ref name="Diagnostic approach">{{cite journal | last=Suresh | first=E | title=Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected vasculitis | journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=82 | issue=970 | date=August 1, 2006 | issn=0032-5473 | doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.042648 | pages=483–488| pmid=16891436 | pmc=2585712 }}</ref> Except for [[rheumatoid vasculitis]], the majority of secondary vasculitis forms are exceedingly rare.<ref name="How to diagnose and treat secondary forms of vasculitis">{{cite journal | last1=Luqmani | first1=Raashid Ahmed | last2=Pathare | first2=Sanjay | last3=Kwok-fai | first3=Tony Lee | title=How to diagnose and treat secondary forms of vasculitis | journal=Best Practice & Research Clinical Rheumatology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=19 | issue=2 | year=2005 | issn=1521-6942 | doi=10.1016/j.berh.2004.11.002 | pages=321–336| pmid=15857799 }}</ref>

=== Single-organ vasculitis ===
Single-organ vasculitis, formerly known as "localized," "limited," "isolated," or "nonsystemic" vasculitis, refers to vasculitis that is limited to one organ or organ system. Examples of this type of vasculitis include gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and peripheral nerve vasculitis.<ref name="Classification and classification criteria"/>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Churg-Strauss syndrome - very high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing a vasculitis ([[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]]). [[H&E stain]].]]
[[File:Vasculitis FDG PET-CT.png|thumb|Severe vasculitis of the major vessels, displayed on [[Positron emission tomography|FDG-PET/CT]]]]
* Laboratory tests of blood or body fluids are performed for patients with active vasculitis. Their results will generally show signs of inflammation in the body, such as increased [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), elevated [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP), [[anemia]], [[leukocytosis|increased white blood cell count]] and [[eosinophilia]]. Other possible findings are elevated [[antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody]] (ANCA) levels and [[hematuria]].
* Other organ functional tests may be abnormal. Specific abnormalities depend on the degree of various organs involvement. A brain [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] can show decreased blood flow to the brain and brain damage.
* The definite diagnosis of vasculitis is established after a [[biopsy]] of involved organ or tissue, such as [[skin]], [[sinuses]], [[lung]], [[nerve]], [[brain]], and [[kidney]]. The biopsy elucidates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation.
:*Some types of vasculitis display '''leukocytoclasis''', which is vascular damage caused by nuclear debris from infiltrating neutrophils.<ref name=medscape-leukocytoclasis>{{cite journal|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/333891-overview|author=A Brooke W Eastham, Ruth Ann Vleugels and Jeffrey P Callen|website=[[Medscape]]|title=Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis|date=12 July 2021}} Updated: Oct 25, 2018</ref> It typically presents as palpable purpura.<ref name=medscape-leukocytoclasis/> Conditions with leucocytoclasis mainly include [[hypersensitivity vasculitis]] (also called ''leukocytoclastic'' vasculitis) and [[cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis]] (also called cutaneous ''leukocytoclastic'' angiitis).
* An alternative to biopsy can be an [[angiogram]] ([[x-ray]] test of the blood vessels). It can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.
* 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)has become a widely used imaging tool in patients with suspected Large Vessel Vasculitis, due to the enhanced glucose metabolism of inflamed vessel walls.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Maffioli L, Mazzone A | year = 2014 | title =  Giant-Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica| journal = NEJM | volume = 371| issue = 17| pages = 1652–1653| doi = 10.1056/NEJMc1409206 | pmid = 25337761 | pmc = 4277693 }}</ref> The combined evaluation of the intensity and the extension of FDG vessel uptake at diagnosis can predict the clinical course of the disease, separating patients with favourable or complicated progress.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dellavedova L, Carletto M, Faggioli P, Sciascera A, Del Sole A, Mazzone A, Maffioli LS | year = 2015 | title = The prognostic value of baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT in steroid-naïve large-vessel vasculitis: introduction of volume-based parameters| journal = European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging| volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 340–8 | doi=10.1007/s00259-015-3148-9| pmid = 26250689 | s2cid = 21446786 }}</ref>
* Acute onset of vasculitis-like symptoms in small children or babies may instead be the life-threatening [[purpura fulminans]], usually associated with severe infection.

== Treatment ==
Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[prednisone]] are used. Additionally, other [[immune suppression]] medications, such as [[cyclophosphamide]] and others, are considered. In case of an infection, antimicrobial agents including [[cephalexin]] may be prescribed. Affected organs (such as the heart or lungs) may require specific medical treatment intended to improve their function during the active phase of the disease.{{cn|date=June 2022}}
