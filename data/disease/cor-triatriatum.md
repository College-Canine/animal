'''Cor triatriatum''' (or '''triatrial heart''')<ref>{{Citation |last=Ather |first=Binish |title=Cor Triatriatum |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534243/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2024-01-11 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30480976 |last2=Meredith |first2=Amanda |last3=Siddiqui |first3=Waqas J.}}</ref> is a [[congenital heart defect]] where the left [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] (cor triatriatum sinistrum) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum) is subdivided by a thin [[membrane]], resulting in three atrial chambers (hence the name).

Cor triatriatum represents 0.1% of all [[Birth defect|congenital]] [[Congenital heart defect|cardiac malformations]] and may be associated with other cardiac defects in as many as 50% of cases. The [[membrane]] may be complete or may contain one or more [[Fenestra|fenestrations]] of varying size.

Cor triatriatum sinistrum is more common.<ref name = "Ullah 2019">{{cite journal |last1=Ullah |first1=Waqas |last2=Sattar |first2=Yasar |last3=Rauf |first3=Hiba |last4=Roomi |first4=Sohaib |last5=Shah |first5=Murtaza |title=A systematic review of a long-forgotten cause of atrial fibrillation and stroke: cor triatriatum |journal=Cureus |date=13 December 2019 |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=e6371 |doi=10.7759/cureus.6371 |doi-access=free |pmid=31938652 |pmc=6957057}}</ref> In this defect, there is typically a proximal chamber that receives the [[Pulmonary vein|pulmonic veins]] and a distal (true) chamber located more [[anteriorly]] where it empties into the [[mitral valve]]. The membrane that separates the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] into two parts varies significantly in size and shape. It may appear similar to a diaphragm or be funnel-shaped, band-like, entirely intact (imperforate) or contain one or more openings (fenestrations) ranging from small, restrictive-type to large and widely open.

In the [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] population, this anomaly may be associated with major [[congenital]] cardiac lesions such as [[tetralogy of Fallot]], [[double outlet right ventricle]], [[coarctation of the aorta]], partial [[anomalous pulmonary venous connection]], persistent left [[superior vena cava]] with unroofed [[coronary sinus]], [[ventricular septal defect]], [[Atrioventricular septal defect|atrioventricular septal (endocardial cushion) defect]], and common [[atrioventricular canal]]. Rarely, [[asplenia]] or [[polysplenia]] has been reported in these patients. In the adult, cor triatriatum is frequently an isolated finding.

==Cause==
Cor triatriatum dextrum is extremely rare and results from the complete persistence of the right [[Valve of coronary sinus|sinus valve]] of the [[Embryonic heart|embryonic heart.]] The membrane divides the right atrium into a proximal (upper) and a distal (lower) chamber. The upper chamber receives the [[venous blood]] from both [[Venae cavae|vena cavae]] and the lower chamber is in contact with the [[tricuspid valve]] and the right [[atrial appendage]].

==Mechanism and Symptoms==
The natural history of this defect depends on the size of the communicating orifice between the upper and lower atrial chambers. If the communicating orifice is small, the patient is critically ill and may succumb at a young age (usually during infancy) to congestive [[heart failure]] and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Cor Triatriatum - Symptoms, Causes, Treatment {{!}} NORD |url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/cor-triatriatum/ |access-date=2024-01-11 |website=rarediseases.org |language=en-US}}</ref> If the connection is larger, patients may present in childhood or young adulthood with a clinical picture similar to that of [[mitral stenosis]]. As the malformed membrane calcifies with age, thus further narrowing such opening, decreased [[cardiac output]] produces features of pulmonary venous [[hypertension]] and right heart failure—including symptoms of [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] and [[orthopnea]], easy [[fatigability]], [[palpitations]] and [[shortness of breath]], among others.<ref name=":0" /> Cor triatriatum may also be an incidental finding when it is nonobstructive.

==Diagnosis==
Primarily diagnosed with imaging, such as [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]] (ultrasound of the heart), [[CT scan|CT]], and/or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cor Triatriatum - Symptoms, Causes, Treatment {{!}} NORD |url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/cor-triatriatum/ |access-date=2024-01-11 |website=rarediseases.org |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of Cor triatriatum varies among cases and is dependent upon presentation of symptoms—incidental finding of the condition in [[asymptomatic]] patients does not typically require immediate medical management, but for those exhibiting [[dyspnea]] and [[pulmonary congestion]], surgical intervention is required. The disorder can be treated surgically by removing the membrane dividing the atrium. The [[surgery]], which usually occurs by first excising the diaphragm and then closing the [[atrial septum]], has a reported survival of 90% at five years, with almost all patients becoming [[asymptomatic]] post-surgery.
