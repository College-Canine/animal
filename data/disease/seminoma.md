A '''seminoma''' is a [[germ cell tumor]] of the [[testicle]] or, more rarely, the [[mediastinum]] or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a [[Malignancy|malignant]] [[neoplasm]] and is one of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001288.htm |title=Testicular cancer |publisher=Medline Plus |access-date=13 December 2012}}</ref>

Testicular seminoma originates in the [[Germinal epithelium (male)|germinal epithelium]] of the [[seminiferous tubule]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000095781|Seminoma}}</ref> About half of germ cell tumors of the testicles are seminomas.<ref name="Sternberg">{{cite book| author = Stacey E. Mills| title = Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology| year = 2009| publisher = LWW| isbn = 978-0-7817-7942-5 }}</ref> Treatment usually requires removal of one testicle. However, fertility usually isn't affected. All other sexual functions will remain intact.

==Signs and symptoms==
The average age of diagnosis is between 35 and 50 years.  This is about 5 to 10 years older than men with other germ cell tumors of the testes.  In most cases, they produce masses that are readily felt on [[testicular self-examination]]; however, in up to 11 percent of cases, there may be no mass able to be felt, or there may be [[testicular atrophy]].  Testicular pain is reported in up to one fifth of cases.  Low back pain may occur after [[metastasis]] to the [[retroperitoneum]].<ref name="Weidner">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weidner N | title = Germ-cell tumors of the mediastinum | journal = Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–50 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10355653 }}</ref>

Some cases of seminoma can present as a primary tumour outside the testis, most commonly in the [[mediastinum]].<ref name=Weidner />  In the [[ovary]], the tumor is called a [[dysgerminoma]], and in non-[[gonad]]al sites, particularly the [[central nervous system]], it is called a [[germinoma]].<ref name=Sternberg />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Seminoma in ultrasound.jpg|thumb|Ultrasound image of a seminoma]]
[[Blood test]]s may detect the presence of placental [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP, ALKP, ALPase, Alk Phos) in fifty percent of cases. However, Alk Phos cannot usefully stand alone as a marker for seminoma and contributes little to follow-up, due to its rise with smoking.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen OS, Munro AJ, Duncan W, Sturgeon J, Gospodarowicz MK, Jewett MA, Malkin A, Thomas GM | title = Is placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) a useful marker for seminoma? | journal = European Journal of Cancer and Clinical Oncology | date = January 1990 | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1049–54 | doi = 10.1016/0277-5379(90)90049-Y | pmid = 2148879 }}</ref>  [[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) may be elevated in some cases, but this correlates more to the presence of [[trophoblast]] cells within the tumour than to the stage of the tumour.  A classical or pure seminoma by definition does not cause an elevated serum [[alpha fetoprotein]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuasa T, Yoshiki T, Ogawa O, Tanaka T, Isono T, Mishina M, Higuchi K, Okada Y, Yoshida O | display-authors = 6 | title = Detection of alpha-fetoprotein mRNA in seminoma | journal = Journal of Andrology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 336–40 | date = May–June 1999 | pmid = 10386812 | doi = 10.1002/j.1939-4640.1999.tb02526.x | s2cid = 7015398 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0196-3635&date=1999&volume=20&issue=3&spage=336 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) may be the only marker that is elevated in some seminomas. The degree of elevation in the serum LDH has prognostic value in advanced seminoma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mencel PJ, Motzer RJ, Mazumdar M, Vlamis V, Bajorin DF, Bosl GJ | title = Advanced seminoma: treatment results, survival, and prognostic factors in 142 patients | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–6 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 7505805 | doi = 10.1200/jco.1994.12.1.120 }} {{Registration required|date=December 2013}}</ref>

The cut surface of the tumour is fleshy and lobulated, and varies in colour from cream to tan to pink. The tumour tends to bulge from the cut surface, and small areas of [[hemorrhage]] may be seen.  These areas of hemorrhage usually correspond to trophoblastic cell clusters within the tumour.<ref name=Sternberg/>

Microscopic examination shows that seminomas are usually composed of either a sheet-like or lobular pattern of cells with a fibrous [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]l network. The fibrous septa almost always contain focal [[lymphocyte]] inclusions, and [[granuloma]]s are sometimes seen. The tumour cells themselves typically have abundant clear to pale pink cytoplasm containing abundant [[glycogen]], which is demonstrable with a [[periodic acid-Schiff]] (PAS) stain. The nuclei are prominent and usually contain one or two large nucleoli, and have prominent nuclear membranes.  Foci of [[syncytiotrophoblast]]ic cells may be present in varied amounts. The adjacent testicular tissue commonly shows [[intratubular germ cell neoplasia]], and may also show variable spermatocytic maturation arrest.<ref name=Sternberg />

===Relation to spermatocytic tumor===
[[Spermatocytic tumor]]s are not considered a subtype of seminoma and unlike other germ cell tumours do not arise from [[intratubular germ cell neoplasia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Müller J, Skakkebaek NE, Parkinson MC | title = The spermatocytic tumor: views on pathogenesis | journal = International Journal of Andrology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–56 | date = February 1987 | pmid = 3583416 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2605.1987.tb00176.x | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Intratesticular masses that appear suspicious on an [[ultrasound]] should be treated with an [[inguinal orchiectomy]].  The pathology of the removed testicle and [[spermatic cord]] indicate the presence of the seminoma and assist in the staging.  Tumors with both seminoma and [[nonseminoma]] elements or that occur with the presence of AFP should be treated as nonseminomas.  Abdominal CT or MRI scans as well as chest imaging are done to detect for metastasis.  The analysis of tumor markers also helps in staging.<ref name="NCCN Testicular Cancer Guidelines">{{cite web | url=http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp | publisher= NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology | title = NCCN Testicular Cancer Guidelines}}</ref>

The preferred treatment for most forms of stage 1 seminoma is active surveillance.  Stage 1 seminoma is characterized by the absence of clinical evidence of metastasis.  Active surveillance consists of periodic history and physical examinations, tumor marker analysis, and radiographic imaging.  Around 85-95% of these cases will require no further treatment.  Modern radiotherapy techniques as well as one or two cycles of single-agent [[carboplatin]] have been shown to reduce the risk of relapse, but carry the potential of causing delayed side effects.  Regardless of treatment strategy, stage 1 seminoma has nearly a 100% cure rate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nichols CR, Roth B, Albers P, Einhorn LH, Foster R, Daneshmand S, Jewett M, Warde P, Sweeney CJ, Beard C, Powles T, Tyldesley S, So A, Porter C, Olgac S, Fizazi K, Hayes-Lattin B, Grimison P, Toner G, Cathomas R, Bokemeyer C, Kollmannsberger C | display-authors = 6 | title = Active surveillance is the preferred approach to clinical stage I testicular cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 31 | issue = 28 | pages = 3490–3 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24002502 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.47.6010 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Stage 2 seminoma is indicated by the presence of [[Retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneal]] metastasis. Cases require radiotherapy or, in advanced cases, combination chemotherapy.  Large residual masses found after chemotherapy may require surgical resection.  Second-line treatment is the same as for nonseminomas.<ref name="NCCN Testicular Cancer Guidelines"/>

Stage 3 seminoma is characterized by the presence of metastasis outside the retroperitoneum—the lungs in "good risk" cases or elsewhere in "intermediate risk" cases.  This is treated with combination chemotherapy. Second-line treatment follows nonseminoma protocols.<ref name="NCCN Testicular Cancer Guidelines"/>
