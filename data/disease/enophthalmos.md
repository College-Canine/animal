'''Enophthalmos''' is a posterior displacement of the [[human eye|eye]]ball within the orbit. It is due to either enlargement of the bony orbit and/or reduction of the orbital content, this in relation to each other.<ref>{{Citation |last=Soparker |first=Charles N.S. |title=ENOPHTHALMOS 376.50 |date=2008 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-1-4160-2447-7.50325-x |work=Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy |pages=593–594 |publisher=Elsevier |access-date=2022-08-26}}</ref>

It should not be confused with its opposite, [[exophthalmos]], which is the anterior displacement of the eye.

It may be a [[congenital]] anomaly, or be acquired as a result of [[Physical trauma|trauma]] (such as in a blowout fracture of the orbit), [[Horner's syndrome]] (apparent enophthalmos due to [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]), [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Duane's syndrome]], [[silent sinus syndrome]] or [[phthisis bulbi]].{{cn|date=June 2022}}
