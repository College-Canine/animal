'''Fibromas''' are [[benign tumor]]s that are composed of fibrous or [[connective tissue]].<ref name="Van Peenen 1966 p. 201">{{cite book |last=Van Peenen |first=H.J. |title=Essentials of Pathology |publisher=Year Book Medical Publishers |year=1966 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2FrAAAAMAAJ |access-date=30 May 2021 |page=201 |quote=The fibroma is a benign tumor, frequently found in fascia and subcutaneous tissue. As is true of most benign tumors, it is composed of cells of fairly normal appearance — in this case, fibroblasts.}}</ref> They can grow in all organs, arising from [[mesenchyme]]  tissue. The term "[[fibroblast]]ic" or "fibromatous" is used to describe tumors of the [[fibrous connective tissue]]. When the term ''fibroma'' is used without modifier, it is usually considered [[benign]], with the term [[fibrosarcoma]] reserved for [[malignant]] tumors.

== Types ==
=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g. in skin it is called [[dermatofibroma]] (fibroma simplex or nodulus cutaneous).<ref name="Mosbys Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions p. 806">{{cite book |title=Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions – eBook |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-323-41419-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIstDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA806 |access-date=30 May 2021 |page=806}}</ref>  A special form is the [[keloid]], which derives from hyperplastic growth of [[scars]].

=== Soft fibroma ===
The soft fibroma (fibroma molle) or fibroma with a shaft ([[acrochordon]], skin tag, fibroma pendulans) consist of many loosely connected cells and less fibroid tissue.<ref name="Mosbys Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions p. 1655">{{cite book |title=Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions – eBook |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-323-41419-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIstDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1655 |access-date=30 May 2021 |page=1655}}</ref> It mostly appears at the neck, armpits or groin. The photo shows a soft fibroma of the eyelid.

=== Other types of fibroma ===
The fibroma cavernosum or [[angiofibroma]], consists of many often dilated vessels, it is a vasoactive tumor occurring almost exclusively in adolescent males.

The cystic fibroma (fibroma cysticum) has central softening or dilated [[lymphatic vessels]].

The myxofibroma (fibroma myxomatodes) is produced by liquefaction of the underlying [[soft tissue]].

The cemento-ossifying fibroma is hard and fibrous, most frequently seen in the [[jaw]] or [[mouth]], sometimes in connection with a [[fracture]] or another type of [[injury]].

Other fibromas: [[chondromyxoid fibroma]], [[desmoplasmic fibroma]], [[nonossifying fibroma]], [[ossifying fibroma]], [[nuchal fibroma]], [[collagenous fibroma]], [[fibroma of tendon sheath]], perifollicular fibroma, pleomorphic fibroma, [[uterine fibroma]], [[Gardner fibroma]], etc.

The [[neurofibroma]] is a benign nerve-sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system.

=== Ovarian fibroma ===
{{Main|Ovarian fibroma}}
It appears in the [[sex cord-stromal tumour]] group of [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian neoplasms]]. Ovary fibromas are most frequent during [[middle age]], and rare in [[children]].
Upon gross [[pathology|pathological]] inspection, ovary fibromas are firm and white or tan.
Variants with [[edema]] are especially likely to be associated with [[Meigs' syndrome]].
On [[Microscope|microscopic]] examination, there are intersecting bundles of spindle cells producing [[collagen]].

There may be [[thecoma]]tous areas ([[fibrothecoma]]).  The presence of an ovarian fibroma can cause [[ovarian torsion]] in some cases.

== Treatment ==
Benign fibromas may, but need not, be removed. Removal is usually a brief outpatient procedure or using cryotherapy in which the lesion is deep frozen (-196 degrees Celsius using liquid nitrogen) and thawed for two or more cycles, with full recovery within 3 to 4 weeks. The cryotherapy treatment needs no anesthetics and is painless. Another simple treatment is snip removal after injecting local anesthetic.
