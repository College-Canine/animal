[[File:Babesia-bovis-transmission.png|thumb|right|200px|''B. bovis'' transmission]]

''Babesia'' is a [[protozoan]] parasite found to infect vertebrate animals, mostly livestock mammals and birds, but also occasionally humans. Common names of the disease that ''Babesia microti'' causes are Texas cattle fever, redwater fever, tick fever, and Nantucket fever.<ref name="Ristic"/> The disease it causes in humans, babesiosis, is also called piroplasmosis.<ref name="Despommier"/>

''Babesia microti'', however, is not part of the genus ''Babesia''. Due to historical misclassifications, the protozoan has been labeled with many names, including ''Nuttallia,''<ref name=nut/> and was renamed from ''Babesia microti'' to ''Theileria microti'' based on evidence from 2006. Its [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequence]], published in 2012, shows that the species belongs to neither ''Babesia'' nor ''Theileria,'' but instead to a separate genus.<ref name=Cornillot2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cornillot E, Hadj-Kaddour K, Dassouli A |title=Sequencing of the smallest Apicomplexan genome from the human pathogen ''Babesia microti'' |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=40 |issue=18 |pages=9102–14 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22833609 |pmc=3467087 |doi=10.1093/nar/gks700 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Another "western" group is also separate from core ''Babesia''.<ref name="pmid27832128"/>

The avian ''Babesia'' species are characterized as having ring and [[Amoeba|amoeboid]] forms, and fan-shaped or cruciform (cross-shaped) tetrad [[schizont]]s. Developing parasites have only been reported in red blood cells.<ref name="Murres">{{Cite journal|last1=Yabsley|first1=Michael|last2=Greiner|first2=Ellis|last3=Tseng|first3=Florina|last4=Garner|first4=Michael|last5=Nordhausen|first5=Robert|last6=Ziccardi|first6=Michael|last7=Borjesson|first7=Dori|last8=Zabolotzky|first8=Shanon|date=2009-05-01|title=Description of Novel Babesia Species and Associated Lesions from Common Murres (Uria aalge) from California|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24259591|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=95|issue=5|pages=1183–8|doi=10.1645/GE-1955.1|pmid=19348514|s2cid=6677489}}</ref>

== History ==
For centuries, the animal disease was known to be a serious illness for wild and domesticated animals, especially cattle. In 1888, [[Victor Babeș]] first identified the causative agent in [[Romania]] and believed it to be due to the bacterium he named ''Haematococcus bovis''. He documented the disease by describing signs of a severe [[hemolysis|hemolytic]] illness seen uniquely in cattle and sheep.<ref name="Ristic"/><ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vannier E, Krause PJ |title=Human babesiosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=366 |issue=25 |pages=2397–407 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22716978 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1202018 |s2cid=205116383 }}</ref>

In 1893, Americans [[Theobald Smith]] and [[Fred Kilborne]] identified the parasite as the cause of Texas cattle fever, the same disease described by Babeș. They also identified the [[tick]] as the transmitting agent, a discovery which first introduced the concept of [[arthropod]]s functioning as [[disease vector]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

It was believed to be a disease that only affected nonhuman mammals, but in 1957, the first case of [[babesiosis]] was seen in a human.<ref name="Despommier" /> The person had been [[splenectomy|splenectomized]], as were all people diagnosed with babesiosis until 1969, when the first case of babesiosis was diagnosed in a person who still had their [[spleen]]. This proved the parasite was a potential pathogen in anyone.<ref>{{cite book|first1=P. C.|last1=Beaver|first2=R. C.|last2=Jung|first3=E. W.|last3=Cupp|first4=C.

== Genetics ==
''Babesia'' show [[host specificity]], allowing many different subspecies of ''Babesia'' to emerge, each infecting a different kind of vertebrate organism.<ref name=Chauvin>{{cite journal|last1=Chauvin|first1=Alain|last2=Moreau|first2=Emmanuelle|last3=Bonnet|first3=Sarah|last4=Plantard|first4=Olivier|last5=Malandrin|first5=Laurence|title=Babesia and its hosts: adaptation to long-lasting interactions as a way to achieve efficient transmission|journal=Veterinary Research|date=21 April 2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=37|doi=10.1051/vetres/2009020|pmid=19379662|pmc=2695028}}</ref> While ''[[B. bovis]]'' and ''[[Babesia bigemina]]'' prefer to infect cattle in tropical environments, they can infect other animals, such as the [[white-tailed deer]].<ref name="Chauvin"/> Therefore, while the organism has the capacity to display host specificity, and thus increase transmission effectiveness, it can still infect a variety of hosts.<ref name="Chauvin"/> It achieves this through mutations and natural selection. In different environments, individual protozoa may develop mutations which, when they increase the protozoa's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], allow the population to increase their numbers. This specificity explains why ''Babesia'' have such great genetic diversity.<ref name="Chauvin"/>

''Babesia'' selfishly persists long-term in the host's system: the host gains no benefit from the parasite invasion and only suffers. This allows the parasite to exploit all resources offered by the host, to increase in number, and to increase the rate of transmission.<ref name="Chauvin"/> Too lethal an infection results in the host's death and the parasite is unable to spread, which is a loss from an evolutionary standpoint.<ref name="Chauvin"/> Different species of ''Babesia'' are able to withstand the stress of the host's immune system. Infection typically stimulates the [[innate immune system]], and not the [[humoral immune system]].<ref name="Chauvin"/> This results in control of the infection, but also persistence and not clearance of the parasite.<ref name="Chauvin"/>

===Genomics===
The genome of ''B. microti'' has been sequenced and shows that the species does not belong to either ''Babesia'' or ''Theileria,'' but instead to a separate genus.<ref name=Cornillot2012/> {{As of| 2013}}, it is known that the [[mitochondrial genome]] is linear like other sequenced [[Apicomplexa]] mitochondrial genomes, although it was initially reported that it was circular.<ref name=Cornillot2013>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cornillot E, Dassouli A, Garg A|title=Whole genome mapping and re-organization of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of ''Babesia microti'' isolates|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=9|pages=e72657|year=2013|pmid=24023759|pmc=3762879|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072657|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2013PLoSO...872657C|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Partial [[RNA sequencing]] of canine [[piroplasms]] has identified a number of additional species.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Life cycle ==
The life cycle of ''B. microti'', which is typical of parasites in the genus, requires a biological stage in a rodent or deer [[Host (biology)|host]]. It is transmitted by [[ticks]] of the family [[Ixodidae]] between these hosts. To begin, the tick as the [[definitive host]] becomes infected itself, as it takes up [[gametocyte]]s when attached for a blood meal. It also introduces the Babesia into the intermediate host (e.g. cattle) when taking a blood meal. As ''Babesia'' enter the animal's [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes), they are called [[sporozoites]]. Within the red blood cell, the protozoa become cyclical and develop into a [[trophozoite]] ring. The trophozoites moult into [[merozoites]], which have a tetrad structure coined a [[Maltese cross|Maltese-cross]] form.<ref name=her>{{cite journal|vauthors=Herwaldt BL, Cacciò S, Gherlinzoni F, etal |title=Molecular characterization of a non-''Babesia divergens'' organism causing zoonotic babesiosis in Europe|journal=Emerging Infect.

The [[gametes]] are [[fertilized]] in the tick gut and develop into [[sporozoites]] in the salivary glands. These are the sporozoites the infected tick introduces when it bites an intermediate host. 
Even as an [[incidental host]], the phase changes which occur in the parasite are the same within humans as in the biological hosts. ''Babesia'' can be diagnosed at the trophozoite stage, and can also be transmitted from human to human through the tick vector, through blood transfusions, or through congenital transmission (an infected mother to her baby).<ref>{{Cite web|title=CDC2 - Babesiosis|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/resources/babesiosis_policy_brief.pdf|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-09-20|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref><ref name="CDCBabesiosis"/>

== Transmission ==
''Babesia'' species are spread through the saliva of a tick when it bites. Already at its [[Nymph (biology)|nymphal]] stage, a tick bites into the skin for a blood meal. The tick, if not removed, stays attached for three to four days, with longer periods of feeding associated with a higher probability of acquiring the parasite. The parasite can survive in the tick as it molts through its various developmental stages, resulting in all tick stages being potentially infectious. Some species of ''Babesia'' can be transmitted from a female tick to its offspring before migrating to salivary glands for feeding.<ref name="Despommier"/> ''B. microti'', the most common species in humans, has not been shown to [[Transovarial transmission|transmit transovarially]].<ref name="CDCBabesiosis"/>

[[Ticks of domestic animals]] that transmit ''Babesia'' and cause much disease include the very widespread cattle ticks, ''Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus'', and ''R.(B.) decoloratus''. These ticks have a strict one-host feeding cycle on cattle, so the ''Babesia'' can only be transmitted by the transovarial route.

In the Americas, ''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'' is the most common vector. This hard tick, commonly known as a deer tick, is also the vector for other tick-associated illnesses, such as [[Lyme disease]]. Many species of ''Babesia'' only infect nonhuman mammalian hosts, most commonly cattle, horses, and sheep. ''B. microti'' and ''B. divergens'' are the two main pathogenic species in humans. Their reservoirs are theorized to be the [[white-footed mouse]] (''Peromyscus leucopus''), [[Microtus|voles from the ''Microtus'' genus]], and the white-tailed deer (''Odocoileus virginianus'').<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Karbowiak G |title=Zoonotic reservoir of ''Babesia microti'' in Poland|journal=Pol. J. Microbiol.|volume=53 Suppl|pages=61–65|year=2004|pmid=15787199}}</ref> These woodland species are hypothesized reservoirs because although they are known to harbor the disease, complete reservoir competence has not yet been shown.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Telford SR, Spielman A |title=Reservoir competence of white-footed mice for ''Babesia microti''|journal=J.

Most cases of transmission between humans are attributed to a tick vector. As of 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) acknowledged more than 40 cases of babesiosis contracted from transfusions of [[packed red blood cells]] (PRBC), as well as two infections documented from organ transplantation. PRBC transfusions that cause infections were identified through testing the blood donor for ''B. microti'' antibodies.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lux JZ, Weiss D, Linden JV, etal |title=Transfusion-associated babesiosis after heart transplant|journal=Emerging Infect. Dis.|volume=9|issue=1|pages=116–119|date=January 2003|pmid=12533293|pmc=2873739|doi=10.3201/eid0901.020149}}</ref> The occurrence of ''Babesia'' transmission through PRBC blood transfusions puts pressure on governmental organizations (such as the CDC) to heighten standard measures for [[Blood donation#Screening#Blood testing|screening blood donations]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Transmission is also possible through congenital transmission (from an infected mother to her baby).  As symptoms may not appear, many women may not be aware they are infected during pregnancy, and therefore a measurement of congenital transmission rate is not known at this time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CDC2 - Babesiosis|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/resources/babesiosis_policy_brief.pdf|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-09-20|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

Currently, no vectors for avian ''Babesia'' have been identified, but they are assumed to be ticks.<ref name="Murres"/> ''Babesia'' species require competent vertebrate and invertebrate hosts to maintain transmission cycles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Homer|first1=Mary J.|last2=Aguilar-Delfin|first2=Irma|last3=Telford|first3=Sam R.|last4=Krause|first4=Peter J.|last5=Persing|first5=David H.|date=2000-07-01|title=Babesiosis|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=13|issue=3|pages=451–469|doi=10.1128/cmr.13.3.451|pmid=10885987|pmc=88943|issn=0893-8512|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Of the species to infect humans, ''B. microti'' is most common in the Americas, whereas ''B. divergens'' is the predominant strain found in Europe. [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]] areas are regions of tick habitat, including the forest regions of the northeastern United States and temperate regions of Europe.<ref name="niaid1" /> Ixodidae, the tick vectors of ''B. microti'', also transmit the better-known ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', the causative agent of Lyme disease. For reasons that remain unclear, in areas endemic to both Lyme disease and babesiosis, Lyme disease transmission prevails and is more predominant in the region.<ref name="Despommier" /> Prevalence of babesiosis in malaria-endemic regions remains unknown due to the likelihood of misdiagnosis as malaria.<ref name="Harrisons" /> As the disease results in a high number of asymptomatic individuals, many populations can possess high [[seroprevalence]] without much documentation of illness. For example, in Rhode Island and Nantucket, seroprevalence has been measured to be 20–25%.<ref name="Despommier" /> Prevalence of babesiosis is mostly documented during the months of May to September, when tick activity in endemic regions is high.<ref name="niaid1" />

==Disease==
Bovine babesiosis caused by ''[[Babesia bovis|B. bovis]]'' is an important constraint for cattle industries worldwide.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===In humans ===
{{Main|Babesiosis}}
Signs of infection with ''B. microti'' usually arise one to eight weeks after a bite from an infectious tick.<ref name="niaid1" /> 
Infections from ''B. divergens'' have a shorter latent period, usually ranging from one to three weeks.<ref name="Harrisons" /> The severity of ''B. microti'' infections varies. For 25% of cases in adults and 50% of cases in children, the disease is asymptomatic or mild with flu-like symptoms. In other cases, symptoms are characterized by irregular fevers, chills, headaches, general lethargy, pain, and [[malaise]].<ref name="Despommier"/> In severe cases effects of parasitic multiplication, symptoms like [[hemolytic anemia]], [[jaundice]], shortness of breath, and [[hemoglobinuria]] have been documented.<ref name="Ristic"/><ref name=Harrisons>{{cite book|last1=Gelfand|first1=Jeffrey A.|last2=Vannier|first2=Edouard|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17e|chapter=Ch. 204: Babesiosis|date=6 March 2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill's Access Medicine|chapter-url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2892931|isbn=978-0071466332}}</ref> Individuals with normal immune function and healthy spleens often recover without treatment.<ref name="Despommier"/>

[[Parasitemia]] levels can reach up to 85% in patients without spleens, compared to 1–10% in individuals with spleens and effective immune systems.<ref name="Harrisons"/>

Complications include [[acute respiratory failure]], [[congestive heart failure]], and [[kidney failure]]. Infections can be fatal in 5–10% of hospitalized patients, with increased risk of death in the [[immunosuppressed]], the elderly, and those also infected with [[Lyme disease]].<ref name="Harrisons"/>
''B. divergens'' infections have a much higher fatality rate (42%) and present with more severe symptoms. Infected individuals experience hemoglobinuria followed by jaundice, a persistently high fever, chills, and sweats. If left untreated, ''B. divergens'' infections can develop into [[Septic shock|shock]]-like symptoms with [[pulmonary edema]] and kidney failure.<ref name="Harrisons"/>

'''<big>In birds</big>'''

The [[pathogenicity]] of ''B. uriae'' for [[murres]] is currently unknown. Birds were found with [[lesion]]s, anemia and respiratory difficulty, and tissues of avian hosts were affected.<ref name="Murres"/> ''Babesia peircei'' infections can cause mild anemia, [[leukocytosis]], and impairment of [[hepatic function]] in [[African penguin]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Parsons|first1=Nola J.|last2=Gous|first2=Tertius A.|last3=Schaefer|first3=Adam M.|last4=Vanstreels|first4=Ralph E.T.|date=2016-03-09|title=Health evaluation of African penguins (''Spheniscus demersus'') in southern Africa|journal=Onderstepoort J Vet Res|volume=83|issue=1|doi=10.4102/ojvr.v83i1.1147|pmid=27796116|issn=2219-0635|pmc=6238701|pages=e1–e13}}</ref>

=== Diagnostic tests ===
As a protozoan parasite, the most effective way to identify ''Babesia'' infection is through [[Blood culture|blood sample testing]].

== Morphology ==
''Babesia'' species enter [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes) at the sporozoite stage. Within the red blood cell, the protozoa become cyclical and develop into a trophozoite ring. The trophozoites moult into merozoites, which have a tetrad structure coined a [[Maltese cross|Maltese-cross]] form.<ref name=her/> This tetrad morphology seen with [[Giemsa staining]] of a thin [[Blood Smear|blood smear]] is unique to ''Babesia'', and distinguishes it from ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', a protozoan of similar morphology that causes malaria. Trophozoite and merozoite growth ruptures the host erythrocyte, leading to the release of vermicules, the infectious parasitic bodies, which rapidly spread the protozoa throughout the blood.<ref name="Despommier" />
It is important to pay attention to particular morphologies of ''Babesia'' in blood smears, because of its great similarity to the malarial parasite ''Plasmodium falciparum''. This has resulted in many patients with babesiosis being misdiagnosed. The few distinguishing factors for ''Babesia'' include protozoa with varying shapes and sizes, the potential to contain [[vacuole]]s, and the lack of pigment production. Trophozoites appearing in a tetrad formation within an erythrocyte are also indicative of ''Babesia''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Despite much study of babesiosis and malaria, misdiagnosis with blood smear can be frequent and problematic. To supplement a blood smear, diagnoses should be made with an [[indirect fluorescent antibody]] (IFA) test. IFA testing has a much higher [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] than stained blood smears, with antibody detection in 88-96% of infected patients.<ref name="CDCBabesiosis"/> Diagnostic measures through antibody testing are also particularly useful for identifying [[Serum (blood)|serum]] prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. Due to the transmissibility of ''Babesia'' through blood transfusions, IFA testing would be an effective means of screening for the disease in blood donations.

Historically, babesiosis diagnosis was carried out with [[xenodiagnosis]] in [[hamster]]s for ''B. microti'' and in [[gerbil]]s for ''B. divergens''.<ref name="Despommier"/> This diagnostic technique has been abandoned in favor of faster diagnostic measures.

=== Treatment ===
Several methods are available to manage and treat babesiosis in animals.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In humans, many spontaneously recover, having only experienced mild symptoms not diagnosed as the disease. This is almost always seen in ''B. microti'' infections, which are generally more common in the United States. For ''B. divergens'' and more severe ''B. microti'' infections, the standard treatment historically for symptomatic individuals was oral or intravenous [[clindamycin]] with oral [[quinine]].<ref name="CDCBabesiosis"/> With the results of research completed in 2000, however, treatment regimens have been increasingly leaning towards oral [[atovaquone]] with oral [[azithromycin]]. The latter are preferred, as they are equally effective in all but the most severe cases and exhibit fewer associated [[adverse reaction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Krause PJ, Lepore T, Sikand VK, etal |title=Atovaquone and azithromycin for the treatment of babesiosis|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=343|issue=20|pages=1454–1458|date=November 2000|pmid=11078770|doi=10.1056/NEJM200011163432004|doi-access=free}}</ref> In severe cases, [[Blood transfusion|blood exchange transfusions]] have been performed to lower the parasitic load in an individual.<ref name="Despommier"/> Other  measures include addressing and correcting abnormal clinical signs.<ref name="Ristic"/>

In seabirds, [[primaquine]] has been used in a study to show effective treatment on infected hosts.<ref name="Treating birds">{{Cite journal|last1=Thijl Vanstreels|first1=Ralph Eric|last2=Hurtado|first2=Renata|last3=Snyman|first3=Albert|last4=Roberts|first4=David G.|last5=Parsons|first5=Nola J.|last6=Pistorius|first6=Pierre A.|date=2019-09-09|title=Empirical Primaquine Treatment of Avian Babesiosis in Seabirds|journal=Journal of Avian Medicine and Surgery|volume=33|issue=3|pages=258–264|doi=10.1647/20178-373|pmid=31893621|s2cid=201949698|issn=1082-6742}}</ref> Treatment for babesiosis consisted of primaquine (1&nbsp;mg/kg PO q24h for 10 days; primaquine [[phosphate]] 1.76%m/v in stabilized solution, Primaquin Solution, MedPet Ltd, [[Benrose]], South Africa). After, treatment was followed by a phospholipid supplement (1 capsule/bird PO q24h for 12 days; deoiled, enriched [[phospholipid]]s from soybeans, 300&nbsp;mg/capsule, Essentiale Extreme, [[Sanofi Aventis]] Ltd, [[Midrand]], South Africa); as an attempt to mitigate potential [[Hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] effects of primaquine. To prevent transmission of Babesia and other tickborne pathogens, all birds with visible [[ectoparasites]] are treated with pesticide powder ([[carbaryl]] 50 g/kg) upon admission, and the facilities are thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis.<ref name="Treating birds"/>

=== Prevention in animals===
In 1906, efforts were made to [[Disease eradication|eradicate]] the tick vector of bovine babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later.<ref name="Ristic"/>

Effective control can be achieved by [[vaccination]] with live [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] [[phenotypes]] of the parasite. The vaccines have a number of drawbacks, so better, safer vaccines are still being researched.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 
In recent{{when|date=December 2017}} years, a number of parasite proteins with [[Immunogenicity|immunogenic]] potential have been discovered. Through [[polymerase chain reaction]], [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]], and bioinformatics analysis of the genes, a high degree of conservation (98–100%) was found among Brazilian isolates of ''B. bovis'' and the [[T2Bo]] isolate. Thus, these genes are considered for inclusion in a [[Recombinant vaccine|recombinant cocktail vaccine]] for cattle babesiosis caused by ''B. bovis''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Prevention in humans===
The most effective public health measure for ''Babesia'' is to avoid tick exposure. This can be through personal prevention such as avoiding tick-infested areas (especially during high tick season between May and September), remaining covered with light clothing, searching for ticks after being outdoors, and removing discovered ticks from the skin.<ref name="Harrisons"/> Other measures include applying [[DEET]], a common repellent that is effective against ticks and insects. (For people who react adversely to DEET, alternative insect repellents should be used.) On a state level, if health departments are particularly motivated, tick elimination is a possibility. In 1906, efforts were made to eradicate the tick vector of the bovine disease form of babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later.<ref name="Ristic"/>

Complete eradication through vector control would be a long-term project, which would significantly reduce the prevalence of both babesiosis and Lyme disease, but, as public health departments are often short on funding, preventive measures are more recommended.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Due to the relatively low prevalence of the human disease and the presence of several reservoirs, babesiosis has not been a candidate for vaccines. 
In regions where [[ticks of domestic animals]] are routinely controlled with chemical [[acaricide]]s to reduce incidence of infection with ''B. bovis'' and ''B. bigemina'', the risk to humans from these parasites will be reduced.
