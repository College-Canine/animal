'''Fanconi syndrome''' or '''Fanconi's syndrome''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|f|ɑː|n|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|i}}, {{IPAc-en|f|æ|n|-}}) is a [[syndrome]] of inadequate [[reabsorption]] in the proximal [[nephron#Renal tubule|renal tubule]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952604|Fanconi syndrome}}</ref> of the [[kidney]]. The syndrome can be caused by various underlying congenital or acquired [[disease]]s, by [[toxicity]] (for example, from [[toxic heavy metal]]s), or by [[adverse drug reaction]]s.<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/kidney_and_urinary_tract_disorders/tubular_and_cystic_kidney_disorders/fanconi_syndrome.html Fanconi Syndrome] at Merck Manual Home Health Handbook</ref> It results in various small molecules of [[metabolism]] being passed into the [[urine]] instead of being [[reabsorption|reabsorbed]] from the [[tubular fluid]] (for example, [[glucose]], [[amino acid]]s, [[uric acid]], [[phosphate]], and [[bicarbonate]]). Fanconi syndrome affects the proximal tubules, namely, the [[proximal convoluted tubule]] (PCT), which is the first part of the tubule to process fluid after it is [[ultrafiltration (renal)|filtered]] through the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]], and the [[proximal straight tubule]] (pars recta), which leads to the [[descending limb of loop of Henle]].{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Different forms of Fanconi syndrome can affect different functions of the proximal tubule, and result in different [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. The loss of bicarbonate results in type 2 or proximal [[renal tubular acidosis]]. The loss of phosphate results in the bone diseases [[rickets]] and [[osteomalacia]] (even with adequate [[vitamin D]] and [[calcium in biology|calcium]] levels), because phosphate is necessary for [[bone tissue#Formation|bone development]] in children and even for ongoing [[bone remodeling|bone metabolism]] in adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Magen D, Berger L, Coady MJ, Ilivitzki A, Militianu D, Tieder M, Selig S, Lapointe JY, Zelikovic I, Skorecki K | title = A loss-of-function mutation in NaPi-IIa and renal Fanconi's syndrome | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 362 | issue = 12 | pages = 1102–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20335586 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0905647 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Presentation==
{{Main|renal tubular acidosis}}
The clinical features of proximal renal tubular acidosis are:{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
* [[Polyuria]], [[polydipsia]] and [[dehydration]]
* Hypophosphatemic [[rickets]] (in children) and [[osteomalacia]] (in adults)
* [[Growth failure]]
* [[Acidosis]]
* [[Hypokalemia]]
* [[Hyperchloremia]]

Other features of the generalized proximal tubular dysfunction of the Fanconi syndrome are:{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
* [[Hypophosphatemia]]/[[hyperphosphaturia]]
* [[Glycosuria]]
* [[Proteinuria]]/aminoaciduria
* [[Hyperuricosuria]]

==Causes==
In contrast to [[Hartnup disease]] and related tubular conditions, Fanconi syndrome affects the transport of many different substances, so is not considered to be a defect in a specific channel, but a more general defect in the function of the proximal tubules.<ref name="urlFanconi Syndrome: eMedicine Pediatrics: General Medicine">{{EMedicine|article|981774|Fanconi Syndrome}}</ref>

Different diseases underlie Fanconi syndrome; they can be [[inheritance|inherited]], [[congenital]], or acquired.

===Inherited===
[[Cystinosis]] is the most common cause of Fanconi syndrome in children.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Other recognised causes are [[Wilson's disease]] (a genetically inherited condition of copper metabolism), [[Lowe syndrome]], [[tyrosinemia]] (type I),<ref name="pmid19156444">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cochat P, Pichault V, Bacchetta J, Dubourg L, Sabot JF, Saban C, Daudon M, Liutkus A | title = Nephrolithiasis related to inborn metabolic diseases | journal = Pediatric Nephrology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–24 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19156444 | pmc = 2810370 | doi = 10.1007/s00467-008-1085-6 }}</ref> [[galactosemia]], [[glycogen storage diseases]], and [[hereditary fructose intolerance]].

Two forms, [[Dent's disease]] and [[Lowe syndrome]], are [[X linked]].<ref name="pmid17494094">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilasi A, Cutillas PR, Maher AD, Zirah SF, Capasso G, Norden AW, Holmes E, Nicholson JK, Unwin RJ | title = Combined proteomic and metabonomic studies in three genetic forms of the renal Fanconi syndrome | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

A recently described form of this disease is due to a mutation in the peroxisomal protein [[EHHADH]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Assmann N, Dettmer K, Simbuerger JM, Broeker C, Nuernberger N, Renner K, Courtneidge H, Klootwijk ED, Duerkop A, Hall A, Kleta R, Oefner PJ, Reichold M, Reinders J | title = Renal Fanconi Syndrome Is Caused by a Mistargeting-Based Mitochondriopathy | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 1423–1429 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27160910 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.04.037 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493687/1/Assmann_Renal%20Fanconi%20Syndrome%20Is%20Caused%20by%20a%20Mistargeting-Based%20Mitochondriopathy%20VoR.pdf | doi-access = free }}</ref> This mutation misdirects the EHHADH to the mitochondria. This interferes with [[respiratory complex I]] and with beta oxidation of fatty acids. The result is a decrease in the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

It was shown that a specific mutation (R76W) of ''[[HNF4A]]'', a gene encoding a transcription factor, causes Fanconi syndrome in human.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AJ, Bingham C, McDonald TJ, Cook PR, Caswell RC, Weedon MN, Oram RA, Shields BM, Shepherd M, Inward CD, Hamilton-Shield JP, Kohlhase J, Ellard S, Hattersley AT | title = The HNF4A R76W mutation causes atypical dominant Fanconi syndrome in addition to a β cell phenotype | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–9 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24285859 | pmc = 3932761 | doi = 10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-102066 | url = }}</ref> In the kidney, ''HNF4A'' is expressed in the proximal tubules specifically.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JW, Chou CL, Knepper MA | title = Deep Sequencing in Microdissected Renal Tubules Identifies Nephron Segment-Specific Transcriptomes | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 2669–77 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 25817355 | pmc = 4625681 | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2014111067 | url = https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/26/11/2669 }}</ref> Deletion of ''Hnf4a'' in the developing mouse kidney caused Fanconi syndrome phenotypes including polyruia, polydipsia, glycosuria, and phosphaturia.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marable SS, Chung E, Adam M, Potter SS, Park JS | title = Hnf4a deletion in the mouse kidney phenocopies Fanconi renotubular syndrome | journal = JCI Insight | volume = 3 | issue = 14 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 30046000 | pmc = 6124415 | doi = 10.1172/jci.insight.97497 }}</ref> The ''Hnf4a'' mutant kidney showed a defect in the formation of proximal tubules.<ref name=":0" />

===Acquired===
It is possible to acquire this disease later in life.

Causes include ingesting expired [[tetracyclines]] (where tetracycline changes to form epitetracycline and anhydrotetracycline which damage the proximal tubule), and as a side effect of [[tenofovir]] in cases of pre-existing renal impairment.<ref>

==Diagnosis==
Urine routine, might not be completely reliable but is an important indicator.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==Treatment==
Treatment of children with Fanconi syndrome mainly consists of replacement of substances lost in the [[urine]] (mainly fluid and bicarbonate).{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==Eponym==
It is named after [[Guido Fanconi]], a Swiss [[pediatrician]], although various other scientists, including [[George Lignac]], contributed to its study.{{when|date=April 2021}} It should not be confused with [[Fanconi anemia]], a separate disease.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
