'''Coccidioidomycosis''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|k|ˌ|s|ɪ|d|i|oɪ|d|oʊ|m|aɪ|ˈ|k|oʊ|s|ɪ|s}}, {{respell|kok|SID|ee|oy|doh|my|KOH|sis}}), commonly known as '''cocci''', '''Valley fever''', as well as '''California fever''', '''desert rheumatism''', or '''San Joaquin Valley fever''', is a mammalian [[mycosis|fungal disease]] caused by ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'' or ''[[Coccidioides posadasii]]''. Coccidioidomycosis is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in certain parts of the United States in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[northern Mexico]].

''C. immitis'' is a [[Polymorphism (biology)|dimorphic]] [[saprophytic]] fungus that grows as a [[mycelium]] in the soil and produces a [[spherule]] form in the [[Host (biology)|host]] organism. ''C. immitis'' is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a [[mold]] with long filaments that break off into airborne [[spore]]s when it rains.

Coccidioidomycosis is a common cause of [[community acquired pneumonia|community-acquired pneumonia]] in the endemic areas of the United States. Infections usually occur due to inhalation of the arthroconidial spores after soil disruption. The disease is not [[contagious disease|contagious]]. In some cases the infection may recur or become chronic.

It was reported in 2022 that valley fever had been increasing in California's Central Valley for years (1,000 cases in [[Kern county]] in 2014, 3,000 in 2021); experts said that cases could rise across the American west as the climate makes the landscape drier and hotter.<ref name="anguiano">{{Cite news |last=Anguiano |first=Dani |date=29 August 2022 |title='It took everything': the disease that can be contracted by breathing California's air |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/29/california-valley-fever-disease-climate-crisis}} Article gives judgement of medical director and earth system  scientist.</ref>

== Classification ==
After ''Coccidioides'' infection, coccidioidomycosis begins with Valley fever, which is its initial acute form. Valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vfce.arizona.edu/valley-fever-people/check-complications|title=Check for Complications &#124; Valley Fever Center for Excellence|website=vfce.arizona.edu}}</ref> Therefore, coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>
* Acute coccidioidomycosis, sometimes described in literature as [[primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis]]
* Chronic coccidioidomycosis
* [[Disseminated coccidioidomycosis]], which includes [[primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis]]

Valley fever is not a [[contagious disease]].<ref name=Malo2014/> In some cases the infection may recur or become chronic.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Coccidiodes lesion 1.jpg|thumb|A skin lesion due to ''Coccidioides'' infection|244x244px]]
An estimated 60% of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms, while 40% will have a range of possible clinical symptoms.<ref name=Malo2014/><ref name="Updates">{{Cite journal|title = Coccidioidomycosis: Recent Updates|journal = Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date = September 23, 2015|pages = 746–755|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1055/s-0035-1562900|first1 = Meryl|last1 = Twarog|first2 = George|last2 = Thompson |pmid=26398540| s2cid=36888911 |url = https://zenodo.org/record/889834}}</ref> Of those who do develop symptoms, the primary infection is most often respiratory, with symptoms resembling [[bronchitis]] or [[pneumonia]] that resolve over a matter of a few weeks. In endemic regions, coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia.<ref name="Updates" /> Notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound [[fatigue (medical)|feeling of tiredness]], loss of smell and taste, [[fever]], cough, [[headache]]s, [[rash]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]], and [[arthralgia|joint pain]].<ref name=Malo2014/> Fatigue can persist for many months after initial infection.<ref name="Updates" />  The classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as "desert rheumatism" includes the combination of fever, joint pains, and [[erythema nodosum]].<ref name=Malo2014/><ref name="John2017">{{cite book|last=Johnstone |first=Ronald B.|title=Weedon's Skin Pathology Essentials |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTE_DAAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Elsevier |edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-7020-6830-0|page=450|chapter=25. Mycoses and Algal infections}}</ref>

A minority (3–5%) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection. This can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting the [[meninges|tissues lining the brain]], soft tissues, joints, and bone). Chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality. Chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough (sometimes productive of mucus), fevers, night sweats and weight loss.<ref name="Updates" /> [[Osteomyelitis]], including involvement of the spine, and [[meningitis]] may occur months to years after initial infection. Severe lung disease may develop in [[HIV]]-infected persons.<ref name=Ampel_2005>{{cite journal | author = Ampel N | title = Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1174–8 | year = 2005 |pmid = 16163637 | doi = 10.1086/444502| doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Complications===
Serious complications may occur in patients who have weakened immune systems, including severe [[pneumonia]] with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection, lung [[granuloma|nodule]]s, and possible disseminated form, where the infection spreads throughout the body.<ref name="Updates" /> The disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, [[abscess]]es, bone lesions, swollen joints with severe pain, heart inflammation, [[urinary tract]] problems, and [[meningitis|inflammation of the brain's lining]], which can lead to death.<ref>Galgiani J.

A particularly severe case of meningitis caused by valley fever in 2012 initially received several incorrect diagnoses such as sinus infections and cluster headaches. The patient became unable to work during diagnosis and original search for treatments. Eventually the right treatment was found—albeit with severe side effects—requiring four pills a day and medication administered directly into the brain every 16 weeks.<ref name=anguiano/>

Rain starts the cycle of initial growth of the fungus in the soil.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kolivras K., Comrie A. | year = 2003 | title = Modeling valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) incidence on the basis of climate conditions | journal = International Journal of Biometeorology | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 87–101 | pmid = 12647095 | doi = 10.1007/s00484-002-0155-x | bibcode = 2003IJBm...47...87K | s2cid = 23498844 }}</ref>  In soil (and in [[Agar plate|agar media]]), ''Coccidioides'' exist in filament form.

This happens when the soil is disturbed, often by clearing trees, construction or  farming.  As the population grows, so do all these activities, causing a potential cascade effect.  The more land that is cleared and the more arid the soil, the riper the environment for ''Coccidioides''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/basics/definition/con-20027390|title = Mayo Clinic|date = May 27, 2015|access-date = September 30, 2015|website = Valley Fever|publisher = Mayo Clinic}}</ref>  These spores can be easily inhaled unknowingly.

Rupture of spherules release these endospores, which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual.  [[Granulomas|Nodules]] can form in lungs surrounding these spherules. When they rupture, they release their contents into bronchi, forming thin-walled cavities. These cavities can cause symptoms including [[Pleurisy|characteristic chest pain]], [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], and persistent cough. In individuals with a weakened immune system, the infection can spread [[fungemia|through the blood]]. The fungus can also, rarely, enter the body through a break in the skin and cause infection.<ref name="CDC" />

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Valley fever.png|thumb|289x289px|A case of [[pulmonary fibrosis]] caused by coccidioidomycosis]]
Coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person's signs and symptoms, findings on radiographic imaging, and laboratory results.<ref name=Malo2014/>
The disease is commonly misdiagnosed as bacterial [[community-acquired pneumonia]].<ref name=Malo2014/> The fungal infection can be demonstrated by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids, exudates, [[sputum]] and [[biopsy]] tissue by methods of Papanicolaou or [[Grocott's methenamine silver stain]]ing. These stains can demonstrate spherules and surrounding inflammation.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

With specific [[nucleotide]] primers, ''C. immitis'' [[DNA]] can be amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). It can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with ''C. immitis'' [[RNA]]. ''C. immitis'' and ''C. posadasii'' cannot be distinguished on cytology or by symptoms, but only by DNA PCR.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

An indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal [[antigen]] or host [[IgM]] or [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] [[antibody]] produced against the fungus. The available tests include the tube-precipitin (TP) assays, [[Complement fixation test|complement fixation assays]], and [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassays]]. TP antibody is not found in [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). TP antibody is [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] and is used as a confirmatory test, whereas ELISA is [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] and thus used for [[Screening (medicine)|initial testing]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

If the meninges are affected, CSF will show [[CSF glucose|abnormally low glucose levels]], an increased level of protein, and lymphocytic [[pleocytosis]]. Rarely, CSF eosinophilia is present.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===Imaging===
[[Chest radiograph|Chest X-rays]] rarely demonstrate nodules or cavities in the lungs, but these images commonly demonstrate lung opacification, [[pleural effusion]]s, or [[Lymphadenopathy|enlargement of lymph nodes]] associated with the lungs.<ref name=Malo2014/> [[Computed tomography]] scans of the chest are more sensitive than chest X-rays to detect these changes.<ref name=Malo2014/>

==Prevention==
Preventing coccidioidomycosis is challenging because it is difficult to avoid breathing in the fungus should it be present; however, the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic. Enhancing surveillance of coccidioidomycosis is key to preparedness in the medical field in addition to improving diagnostics for early infections.<ref name="Hector 1150–1173"/>  There are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through Valley fever-endemic areas. Recommended preventive measures include avoiding airborne dust or dirt, but this does not guarantee protection against infection. People in certain occupations may be advised to wear face masks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Risk factors|url=http://vfce.arizona.edu/valley-fever-people/check-risk-factors|publisher=Valley Fever Center for Excellence}}</ref> The use of air filtration indoors is also helpful, in addition to keeping skin injuries clean and covered to avoid skin infection.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===Toxicity===
Conventional ''[[amphotericin B desoxycholate]]'' (AmB: used since the 1950s as a primary agent) is known to be associated with increased drug-induced [[nephrotoxicity]] impairing [[Renal function|kidney function]].<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2008/0915/p743.html Drug-Induced Nephrotoxicity]: American Family Physician (2008 Sep 15;78(6):743-750)- Retrieved January 16, 2017</ref> Other formulations have been developed such as lipid-soluble formulations to mitigate side-effects such as direct proximal and distal tubular [[cytotoxicity]].

==Epidemiology==
Coccidioidomycosis is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to the western hemisphere between 40°N and 40°S, including certain parts of the United States in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], and northern Mexico.<ref name="Hector_2005" /> The ecological niches are characterized by hot summers and mild winters with an annual rainfall of 10–50&nbsp;ml.<ref name="Coccidioidomycosis: epidemiology">{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jennifer|title=Coccidioidomycosis: epidemiology|pmc=3702223|pmid=23843703|doi=10.2147/CLEP.S34434|volume=5|journal=Clin Epidemiol|pages=185–97|year=2013 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
The species are found in alkaline sandy soil, typically 10–30&nbsp;cm below the surface. In harmony with the mycelium life cycle, incidence increases with periods of dryness after a rainy season; this phenomenon, termed "grow and blow", refers to growth of the fungus in wet weather, producing spores which are spread by the wind during succeeding dry weather. While the majority of cases are observed in the endemic region, cases reported outside the area are generally visitors, who contact the infection and return to their native areas before becoming symptomatic.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===North America===
In the United States, ''C. immitis'' is endemic to southern and central California with the highest presence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. ''C. posadassi'' is most prevalent in Arizona, although it can be found in a wider region spanning from Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Nevada. An estimated 150,000 infections occur annually, with 25,000 new infections occurring every year.{{Contradict-inline|date=September 2022}} The incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the United States in 2011 (42.6 per 100,000) was almost ten times higher than the incidence reported in 1998 (5.3 per 100,000). In area where it is most prevalent, the infection rate is 2-4%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hospenthal|first1=Duane|title=Coccidioidomycosis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/215978-overview#a5|website=Medscape|access-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref>

Incidence varies widely across the west and southwest. In Arizona, for instance, in 2007, there were 3,450 cases in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], which in 2007 had an estimated population of 3,880,181<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/04013.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau, State & County QuickFacts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226144742/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/04013.html |archivedate=February 26, 2016 }}</ref> for an incidence of approximately 1 in 1,125.<ref name="azdhs.gov">{{cite web | url=http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/pdf/countycases2007.pdf | title=Number of Reported Cases of Selected Notifiable Diseases by Category for each County, Arizona, 2007 | publisher=Arizona Department of Health Services | access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref> In contrast, though southern New Mexico is considered an endemic region, there were 35 cases in the entire state in 2008 and 23 in 2007,<ref name="azdhs.gov"/> in a region that had an estimated 2008 population of 1,984,356,<ref>New Mexico Intercensal Population Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau {{cite web |url=http://bber.unm.edu/demo/nm2000s.htm |title=New Mexico Intercensal Population Estimates |access-date=February 7, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222230636/http://bber.unm.edu/demo/nm2000s.htm |archive-date=February 22, 2012 }}</ref> for an incidence of approximately 1 in 56,695.

Infection rates vary greatly by county, and although population density is important, so are other factors that have not been proven yet. Greater construction activity may disturb spores in the soil. In addition, the effect of altitude on fungi growth and morphology has not been studied, and altitude can range from sea level to 10,000 feet or higher across California, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In California from 2000 to 2007, there were 16,970 reported cases (5.9 per 100,000 people) and 752 deaths of the 8,657 people hospitalized.

There was an outbreak in the summer of 2001 in Colorado, away from where the disease was considered endemic. A group of archeologists visited [[Dinosaur National Monument]], and eight members of the crew, along with two National Park Service workers were diagnosed with Valley fever.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5045a1.htm | title=Coccidioidomycosis in Workers at an Archeologic Site ---Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, June--July 2001 | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), 50(45), p. 1005-1008 | date=November 16, 2001 | access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

California state prisons, beginning in 1919, have been particularly affected by coccidioidomycosis. In 2005 and 2006, the [[Pleasant Valley State Prison]] near [[Coalinga]] and [[Avenal State Prison]] near [[Avenal]] on the western side of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] had the highest incidence in 2005, of at least 3,000 per 100,000.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Coccidioidomycosis in California State Correctional Institutions | author=Pappagianis, Demosthenes | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=September 2007 | volume=1111 | issue=1 | doi=10.1196/annals.1406.011 | pages=103–11 | pmid=17332089 | author2=Coccidioidomycosis Serology Laboratory| bibcode=2007NYASA1111..103P | s2cid=29147634 }}</ref> The [[Receivership|receiver]] appointed in ''[[Plata v.

The incidence rate has been increasing, with rates as high as 7% during 2006–2010. The cost of care and treatment is $23 million in California prisons. A lawsuit was filed against the state in 2014 on behalf of 58 inmates stating that the Avenal and Pleasant valley state prisons did not take necessary steps to prevent infections.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDC Says Calif.

===Population risk factors===
There are several populations that have a higher risk for contracting coccidioidomycosis and developing the advanced disseminated version of the disease. Populations with exposure to the airborne arthroconidia working in agriculture and construction have a higher risk. Outbreaks have also been linked to earthquakes, windstorms and military training exercises where the ground is disturbed.<ref name="Coccidioidomycosis: epidemiology"/> Historically, an infection is more likely to occur in males than females, although this could be attributed to occupation rather than being sex-specific.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Women who are pregnant and immediately postpartum are at a high risk of infection and dissemination. There is also an association between stage of pregnancy and severity of the disease, with third trimester women being more likely to develop dissemination. Presumably this is related to highly elevated hormonal levels, which stimulate growth and maturation of spherules and subsequent release of endospores.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Coccidioidomycosis|last = Shehab|first = Ziad M.|date = 2010|journal = Advances in Pediatrics|doi = 10.1016/j.yapd.2010.08.008|pmid =21056742|volume=57|issue = 1|pages=269–286}}</ref> Certain ethnic populations are more susceptible to disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

In particular, individuals with [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] and diseases that impair [[T-cell]] function. Individuals with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes are also at a higher risk. Age also affects the severity of the disease, with more than one-third of deaths being in the 65-84 age group.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Rachel|title=Just One Breath: More People Dying from Valley Fever – Especially Those With Chronic Disease, Study Shows|url=http://www.reportingonhealth.org/valleyfever/just-one-breath-more-people-dying-valley-fever-especially-those-chronic-disease-study|website=Reporting on Health|access-date=October 20, 2015|archive-date=July 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712232432/http://www.reportingonhealth.org/valleyfever/just-one-breath-more-people-dying-valley-fever-especially-those-chronic-disease-study|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Valley fever is not contagious.

In dogs, the most common symptom of coccidioidomycosis is a chronic cough, which can be dry or moist. Other symptoms include fever (in approximately 50% of cases), weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and depression. The disease can [[Disseminated disease|disseminate]] throughout the dog's body, most commonly causing [[osteomyelitis]] (infection of the bone), which leads to lameness. Dissemination can cause other symptoms, depending on which organs are infected. If the fungus infects the heart or [[pericardium]], it can cause [[heart failure]] and death.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Coccidioidomycosis in Dogs and Cats: A Review|journal = [[Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association]]|date = September 1, 2008|issn = 0587-2871|pages = 226–235|volume = 44|issue = 5|doi = 10.5326/0440226|pmid = 18762558|first1 = Angela|last1 = Graupmann-Kuzma|first2 = Beth A.|last2 = Valentine|first3 = Lisa F.|last3 = Shubitz|first4 = Sharon M.|last4 = Dial|first5 = Barbara|last5 = Watrous|first6 = Susan J.|last6 = Tornquist}}</ref>

In cats, symptoms may include skin lesions, fever, and loss of appetite, with skin lesions being the most common.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Coccidioidomycosis in 48 Cats: A Retrospective Study (1984–1993)|journal = Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|date = March 1, 1995|issn = 1939-1676|pages = 86–91|volume = 9|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1939-1676.1995.tb03277.x|pmid = 7760314|first1 = Russell T.|last1 = Greene|first2 = Gregory C.|last2 = Troy|doi-access = }}</ref>

Other species in which Valley fever has been found include livestock such as cattle and horses; llamas; marine mammals, including sea otters; zoo animals such as monkeys and apes, kangaroos, tigers, etc.; and wildlife native to the geographic area where the fungus is found, such as cougars, skunks, and [[javelina]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valley Fever Center for Excellence: Valley Fever in Other Animal Species|publisher=University of Arizona|url =http://vfce.arizona.edu/valley-fever-dogs/valley-fever-other-animals}}</ref>

* In the Season 1 episode of [[Bones (TV series)|Bones]] called "[[The Man in the Fallout Shelter]]" the entire lab is exposed to coccidioidomycosis through inhalation of bone dust. Erroneously, the team is forced to quarantine in the lab on Christmas Eve to prevent the disease from spreading to the public (in real life, the disease is not contagious).<ref>{{Citation |last=Yaitanes |first=Greg |title=The Man in the Fallout Shelter |date=2005-12-13 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0529896/ |series=Bones |access-date=2022-12-16}}</ref>
** The lab is later exposed to it again in the Season 2 episode "[[The Priest in the Churchyard]]" from contaminated graveyard soil but only receives a series of injections rather than be forced to quarantine.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lautanen |first=Scott |title=The Priest in the Churchyard |date=2007-03-28 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988238/ |series=Bones |access-date=2022-12-16}}</ref>
