An '''overriding aorta''' is a [[congenital heart defect]] where the [[aorta]] is positioned directly over a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD), instead of over the [[left ventricle]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Overriding aorta (Concept Id: C0265886) - MedGen - NCBI |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/120559 |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |access-date=31 October 2021 |language=en}}</ref> The result is that the aorta receives some blood from the [[right ventricle]], causing mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated [[blood]], and thereby reducing the amount of [[oxygen]] delivered to the tissues.

It is one of the four findings in the classic [[tetralogy of Fallot]].  The other three findings are right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction (most often subpulmonary stenosis), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and ventricular septal defect (VSD).
