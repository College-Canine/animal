'''Progesterone''' ('''P4''') is an [[endogenous]] [[steroid]] and [[progestogen]] [[sex hormone]] involved in the [[menstrual cycle]], [[pregnancy]], and [[embryogenesis]] of humans and other species.<ref name="James2015" /><ref name="KingBrucker2010" /> It belongs to a group of steroid hormones called the [[progestogen]]s<ref name="KingBrucker2010" /> and is the major progestogen in the body. Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body. It is also a crucial [[metabolic intermediate]] in the production of other endogenous [[steroid]]s, including the [[sex hormone]]s and the [[corticosteroid]]s, and plays an important role in brain function as a [[neurosteroid]].<ref name="pmid11108866">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baulieu E, Schumacher M | title = Progesterone as a neuroactive neurosteroid, with special reference to the effect of progesterone on myelination | journal = Steroids | volume = 65 | issue = 10–11 | pages = 605–612 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11108866 | doi = 10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00173-2 | s2cid = 14952168 }}</ref>

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in combination with [[estrogen]] for [[contraception]], to reduce the risk of [[Uterine cancer|uterine]] or [[cervical cancer]], in [[hormone replacement therapy]], and in [[feminizing hormone therapy]].<ref name="pmid30608551">{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior JC | title = Progesterone Is Important for Transgender Women's Therapy-Applying Evidence for the Benefits of Progesterone in Ciswomen | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | pages = 1181–1186 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30608551 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2018-01777 | quote = Evidence has accrued that normal progesterone (and ovulation), as well as physiological estradiol levels, is necessary during ciswomen's premenopausal menstrual cycles for current fertility and long-term health; transgender women may require progesterone therapy and similar potential physiological benefits | s2cid = 58620122 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It was first prescribed in 1934.<ref name=Fis2006>{{cite book | vauthors = Fischer J, Ganellin CR |title=Analogue-based Drug Discovery |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9783527607495 |page=47X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjKfqkaKkAAC&pg=PA47X }}</ref>

Progesterone modulates the activity of [[cation channels of sperm|CatSper]] (cation channels of sperm) [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated]] Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs ([[chemotaxis]]).

Elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.<ref name="pmid13263410">{{cite journal | vauthors = Landau RL, Bergenstal DM, Lugibihl K, Kascht ME | title = The metabolic effects of progesterone in man | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1194–1215 | date = October 1955 | pmid = 13263410 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-10-1194 }}</ref>

During early fetal development, the undifferentiated gonads can develop into either testes or ovaries. The presence of the [[Y chromosome]] leads to the development of testes. The testes then produce testosterone, which is converted to DHT via the enzyme [[5α-Reductase|5α-reductase]]. DHT is a potent androgen that is responsible for the masculinization of the external genitalia and the development of the prostate gland. Progesterone, produced by the placenta during pregnancy, plays a role in fetal sexual differentiation by serving as a precursor molecule for the synthesis of DHT via the backdoor pathway. In the absence of adequate levels of [[steroidogenic enzymes]] during fetal development, the [[Androgen backdoor pathway#Dihydrotestosterone backdoor biosynthesis|backdoor pathway for DHT synthesis]] can become deficient, leading to undermasculinization of the male fetus. This can result in the development of ambiguous genitalia or even female genitalia in some cases. Therefore, both DHT and progesterone play crucial roles in early fetal sexual differentiation, with progesterone acting as a precursor molecule for DHT synthesis and DHT promoting the development of male genitalia.<ref name=wj/>

They also found that men who had high levels of progesterone were more likely to have higher homoerotic motivation scores after affiliative priming compared to men with low levels of progesterone.<ref name="pmid25420899">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleischman DS, Fessler DM, Cholakians AE | title = Testing the Affiliation Hypothesis of Homoerotic Motivation in Humans: The Effects of Progesterone and Priming | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 1395–1404 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25420899 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0436-6 | s2cid = 9864224 | url = https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/testing-the-affiliation-hypothesis-of-homoerotic-motivation-in-humans(d1eb5448-5664-4d2d-8694-18f970836cbb).html | access-date = 2 August 2023 | archive-date = 23 September 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200923005905/https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/testing-the-affiliation-hypothesis-of-homoerotic-motivation-in-humans(d1eb5448-5664-4d2d-8694-18f970836cbb).html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="UoP-News-Homos">{{cite news |title=Homosexuality may help us bond | work = UoP News |url=https://uopnews.port.ac.uk/2014/11/25/homosexuality-may-help-us-bond/ |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-date=2 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702203503/https://uopnews.port.ac.uk/2014/11/25/homosexuality-may-help-us-bond/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="The-Telegraph-2014">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11251206/Having-homosexual-thoughts-is-an-essential-part-of-human-evolution-study-suggests.html|title=Having homosexual thoughts 'is an essential part of human evolution' study suggests|date=25 November 2014|website=The Telegraph|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215160336/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11251206/Having-homosexual-thoughts-is-an-essential-part-of-human-evolution-study-suggests.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="HuffPost-2014">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homosexuality-evolution-social-bonding_n_6218406|title=New Study Identifies Evolutionary Basis Of Homosexuality|date=26 November 2014|website=HuffPost|access-date=21 October 2023|archive-date=27 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231127222130/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homosexuality-evolution-social-bonding_n_6218406|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Nervous system===
Progesterone, like [[pregnenolone]] and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), belongs to an important group of endogenous steroids called [[neurosteroid]]s. It can be metabolized within all parts of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="pmid558037">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Karavolas HJ, Goy RW | title = Progesterone metabolism in the pineal, brain stem, thalamus and corpus callosum of the female rat | journal = Brain Research | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–324 | date = April 1977 | pmid = 558037 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(77)90624-2 | s2cid = 35814845 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/890908 | access-date = 28 June 2019 | archive-date = 5 March 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210305233844/https://zenodo.org/record/890908 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Brain damage===
{{See also|Progesterone (medication)#Other uses}}

Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to [[traumatic brain injury]] and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of [[estrogen]] and progesterone in females.<ref name="pmid10833057">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roof RL, Hall ED | title = Gender differences in acute CNS trauma and stroke: neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–388 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10833057 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2000.17.367 }}</ref>

====Proposed mechanism====
The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma and hemorrhage.<ref name="pmid18188998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan DS, Liu WG, Yang XF, Cao F | title = Inhibitory effect of progesterone on inflammatory factors after experimental traumatic brain injury | journal = Biomedical and Environmental Sciences | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 432–438 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 18188998 }}</ref><ref name="pmid27143417">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang C, Zuo F, Wang Y, Wan J, Yang Z, Lu H, Chen W, Zang W, Yang Q, Wang J | display-authors = 6 | title = Progesterone exerts neuroprotective effects and improves long-term neurologic outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage in middle-aged mice | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 42 | pages = 13–24 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27143417 | pmc = 4857017 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.02.029 }}</ref>

Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass [[depolarization]] leading to [[excitotoxicity]]. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s that trigger [[neurotransmitter]] release.<ref name="pmid22101209">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luoma JI, Stern CM, Mermelstein PG | title = Progesterone inhibition of neuronal calcium signaling underlies aspects of progesterone-mediated neuroprotection | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 131 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 30–36 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22101209 | pmc = 3303940 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.11.002 }}</ref> It does so by manipulating the signaling pathways of [[transcription factor]]s involved in this release.

Progesterone has also been shown to prevent [[apoptosis]] in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury.<ref name="pmid22088981">{{cite journal | vauthors = Espinoza TR, Wright DW | title = The role of progesterone in traumatic brain injury | journal = The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 497–499 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22088981 | pmc = 6025750 | doi = 10.1097/HTR.0b013e31823088fa }}</ref> It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated [[caspase 3]] and [[cytochrome c]].

===Addiction===

Progesterone enhances the function of [[serotonin receptor]]s in the brain, so an excess or deficit of progesterone has the potential to result in significant neurochemical issues. This provides an explanation for why some people resort to substances that enhance [[serotonin]] activity such as [[nicotine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels.<ref name="pmid21186920">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch WJ, Sofuoglu M | title = Role of progesterone in nicotine addiction: evidence from initiation to relapse | journal = Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 451–461 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21186920 | pmc = 3638762 | doi = 10.1037/a0021265 }}</ref>
* Sex differences in hormone levels may induce women to respond differently than men to nicotine. When women undergo cyclic changes or different hormonal transition phases (menopause, pregnancy, adolescence), there are changes in their progesterone levels.<ref name="pmid22474108">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosgrove KP, Esterlis I, McKee SA, Bois F, Seibyl JP, Mazure CM, Krishnan-Sarin S, Staley JK, Picciotto MR, O'Malley SS | display-authors = 6 | title = Sex differences in availability of β2*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in recently abstinent tobacco smokers | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 418–427 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22474108 | pmc = 3508698 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.1465 }}</ref> Therefore, females have an increased biological vulnerability to nicotine's reinforcing effects compared to males and progesterone may be used to counter this enhanced vulnerability.

* Similar to nicotine, cocaine also increases the release of dopamine in the brain. The neurotransmitter is involved in the reward center and is one of the main neurotransmitters involved with substance abuse and reliance. In a study of cocaine users, it was reported that progesterone reduced craving and the feeling of being stimulated by cocaine. Thus, progesterone was suggested as an agent that decreases cocaine craving by reducing the dopaminergic properties of the drug.<ref name="pmid21796112">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mello NK, Knudson IM, Kelly M, Fivel PA, Mendelson JH | title = Effects of progesterone and testosterone on cocaine self-administration and cocaine discrimination by female rhesus monkeys | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2187–2199 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21796112 | pmc = 3176575 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2011.130 }}</ref>

In mammals, progesterone, like all other [[steroid]] [[hormone]]s, is synthesized from [[pregnenolone]], which itself is derived from [[cholesterol]].

Cholesterol undergoes double oxidation to produce [[22R-hydroxycholesterol|22''R''-hydroxycholesterol]] and then [[20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol|20α,22''R''-dihydroxycholesterol]]. This vicinal [[diol]] is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C22 to produce pregnenolone. This reaction is catalyzed by [[cytochrome]] [[P450scc]].

The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3β-[[hydroxyl]] group is oxidized to a [[ketone|keto]] group and second, the [[double bond]] is moved to C4, from C5 through a keto/[[enol]] [[tautomer]]ization reaction.<ref name="isbn0-471-49641-3">{{cite book | vauthors = Bewick PM | title = Medicinal natural products: a biosynthetic approach | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2002 | pages = 244 | isbn = 0-471-49641-3 }}</ref> This reaction is catalyzed by [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ<sup>5-4</sup>-isomerase]].

Progesterone in turn is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid [[aldosterone]], and after conversion to [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]], of [[cortisol]] and [[androstenedione]].

In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], rise after [[ovulation]], and are elevated during the [[luteal phase]], as shown in the diagram above. Progesterone levels tend to be less than 2&nbsp;ng/mL prior to ovulation and greater than 5&nbsp;ng/mL after ovulation. If [[pregnancy]] occurs, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is released, maintaining the corpus luteum and allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. Between 7 and 9&nbsp;weeks, the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus luteum in a process called the luteal-placental shift.<ref name="pmid4688578">{{cite journal | vauthors = Csapo AI, Pulkkinen MO, Wiest WG | title = Effects of luteectomy and progesterone replacement therapy in early pregnant patients | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–765 | date = March 1973 | pmid = 4688578 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(73)90517-6 }}</ref>

After the luteal-placental shift, progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100 to 200&nbsp;ng/mL at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]] has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low.

Progesterone levels are low in children and postmenopausal women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Progesterone Historical Reference Ranges |author=NIH Clinical Center |date=16 August 2004 |publisher=United States National Institutes of Health |url=http://cclnprod.cc.nih.gov/dlm/testguide.nsf/Index/CB26894E1EB28DEF85256BA5005B000E?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109072721/http://cclnprod.cc.nih.gov/dlm/testguide.nsf/Index/CB26894E1EB28DEF85256BA5005B000E?OpenDocument |archive-date=9 January 2009 |access-date=12 March 2008}}</ref> Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

===Sources===

====Animal====
Progesterone is produced in high amounts in the [[ovaries]] (by the [[corpus luteum]]) from the onset of [[puberty]] to [[menopause]], and is also produced in smaller amounts by the [[adrenal gland]]s after the onset of [[adrenarche]] in both males and females. To a lesser extent, progesterone is produced in [[nervous tissue]], especially in the brain, and in [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]], as well.

During human [[pregnancy]], progesterone is produced in increasingly high amounts by the ovaries and [[placenta]]. At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been "rescued" by the presence of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) from the conceptus. However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal corticosteroids. At term the placenta produces about 250&nbsp;mg progesterone per day.

An additional animal source of progesterone is milk products. After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up.<ref name="titleResult Content View">{{cite web | url = http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573B1007803AD | title = Milk products are a source of dietary progesterone | access-date = 12 March 2008 | vauthors = Goodson III WH, Handagama P, Moore II DH, Dairkee S | date = 13 December 2007 | publisher = 30th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium | pages = abstract # 2028 | archive-date = 20 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920110341/http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573B1007803AD | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Synthesis===
Progesterone is commercially produced by semisynthesis. Two main routes are used: one from yam [[diosgenin]] first pioneered by Marker in 1940, and one based on soy [[phytosterol]]s scaled up in the 1970s.  Additional (not necessarily economical) semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids. For the example, [[cortisone]] can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in [[chloroform]] to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.<ref name="pmid3815593">{{cite journal | vauthors = Numazawa M, Nagaoka M, Kunitama Y | title = Regiospecific deoxygenation of the dihydroxyacetone moiety at C-17 of corticoid steroids with iodotrimethylsilane | journal = Chemical & Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 3722–3726 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3815593 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.34.3722 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Marker semisynthesis====

The [[ketal]] [[protecting group]]s of '''<u>9</u>''' are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone '''<u>10</u>''', which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone '''<u>11</u>'''. The ketone of '''<u>11</u>''' is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol '''<u>12</u>''', which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation '''<u>13</u>'''. The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of '''<u>13</u>''' in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce '''<u>14</u>'''. This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as ''biomimetic''. In the next step the [[enol]] [[orthoester]] is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone '''<u>15</u>'''. The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce '''<u>16</u>'''. Finally, the diketone '''<u>17</u>''' undergoes an intramolecular [[aldol condensation]] by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone.<ref name="pmid5131151"/>

===Veterinary use===
The use of progesterone tests in dog breeding to pinpoint ovulation is becoming more widely used.  There are several tests available but the most reliable test is a blood test with blood drawn by a veterinarian and sent to a lab for processing.  Results can usually be obtained with 24 to 72 hours.  The rationale for using progesterone tests is that increased numbers begin in close proximity to preovulatory surge in gonadotrophins and continue through ovulation and estrus.  When progesterone levels reach certain levels they can signal the stage of estrus the female is.  Prediction of birth date of the pending litter can be very accurate if ovulation date is known.  Puppies deliver with a day or two of 9 weeks gestation in most cases.  It is not possible to determine pregnancy using progesterone tests once a breeding has taken place, however.  This is due to the fact that, in dogs, progesterone levels remain elevated throughout the estrus period.<ref name="Refsal-2009">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Refsal K|date=February 2009|title=Interpretation of Serum Progesterone Results for Management of Breeding in Dogs|url=https://www.dcpah.msu.edu/sections/endocrinology/Progesterone_Guidelines.pdf|journal=Webcd.endo.ref|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-date=29 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210829011032/https://cvm.msu.edu/vdl|url-status=live}}</ref>
