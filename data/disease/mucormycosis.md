[[File:Periorbital fungal infection known as mucormycosis, or phycomycosis PHIL 2831 lores.jpg|200px|thumb|Early stages of periorbital mucormycosis]]
Signs and symptoms of mucormycosis depend on the location in the body of the infection.<ref name=CDC2021Sym/> Infection usually begins in the mouth or nose and enters the central nervous system via the eyes.<ref name=Gros2012/>

If the fungal infection begins in the nose or sinus and extends to brain, symptoms and signs may include one-sided eye pain or [[headache]], and may be accompanied by pain in the face, numbness, [[fever]], [[hyposmia|loss of smell]], a [[nasal congestion|blocked nose]] or [[coryza|runny nose]].

===Risk factors===
Predisposing factors for mucormycosis include [[immunodeficiency|immune deficiencies]], a [[neutropenia|low neutrophil count]], and [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref name="John2017"/><ref name=Stat2021/> Risk factors include poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus]] (particularly [[diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]]), [[organ transplant]], [[iron overload]], such [[cancer]]s as [[lymphoma]]s, [[kidney failure]], [[cirrhosis|liver disease]], severe [[malnutrition]], and long term [[corticosteroid]] and [[immunosuppressant|immunosuppressive therapy]].<ref name=McDonaldBackground/><ref name=CDC2021Prev/> Other risk factors include [[tuberculosis]] (TB),<ref name=Dan2020/> [[deferoxamine]]<ref name="Chand2018"/> and to a lesser extent [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name="Chand2018"/><ref name=Spel2005/> Cases of mucormycosis in fit and healthy people are less common.<ref name=Spel2005/>

Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of COVID-19 and reduce damage caused by the body's own immune response to the virus. They are immunosuppressant and increase blood sugar levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. It is thought that both these effects may contribute to cases of mucormycosis.<ref name="bbc-black-fungus-covid19">{{cite news | vauthors = Biswas S |title=Mucormycosis: The 'black fungus' maiming Covid patients in India |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57027829 |access-date=11 May 2021 |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=9 May 2021}}</ref><ref name=Koehler>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koehler P, Bassetti M, Chakrabarti A, Chen SC, Colombo AL, Hoenigl M, Klimko N, Lass-Flörl C, Oladele RO, Vinh DC, Zhu LP, Böll B, Brüggemann R, Gangneux JP, Perfect JR, Patterson TF, Persigehl T, Meis JF, Ostrosky-Zeichner L, White PL, Verweij PE, Cornely OA | display-authors = 6 | title = Defining and managing COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis: the 2020 ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria for research and clinical guidance | journal = The Lancet.

==Mechanism==
Most people are frequently exposed to Mucorales without developing the disease.<ref name=McDonaldBackground/> Mucormycosis is generally spread by [[inhalation|breathing in]], eating food contaminated by, or getting spores of molds of the [[Mucorales]] type in an open [[wound]].<ref name=Reid2020/> It is not transmitted between people.<ref name=CDC2021About/>

The precise mechanism by which diabetics become susceptible is unclear. ''[[In vivo]]'', a high sugar level alone does not permit the growth of the fungus, but [[acidosis]] alone does.<ref name="Chand2018"/><ref name=Spel2005/> People with high sugar levels frequently have high iron levels, also known to be a risk factor for developing mucormycosis.<ref name=Spel2005/> In people taking deferoxamine, the iron removed is captured by [[siderophore]]s on ''Rhizopus'' species, which then use the iron to grow.<ref name=Prakash2019/>

==Diagnosis==
There is no blood test that can confirm the diagnosis.<ref name="McDonaldWork"/> Diagnosis requires identifying the mold in the affected tissue by [[biopsy]] and confirming it with a fungal culture.<ref name=NORD2021/> Because the causative fungi occur all around and may therefore contaminate cultures underway, a culture alone is not decisive.<ref name=Gros2012/> Tests may also include culture and direct detection of the fungus in [[bronchoalveolar lavage|lung fluid]], blood, serum, plasma and urine.<ref name=Dan2020/> Blood tests include a [[complete blood count]] to look specifically for neutropenia.<ref name="McDonaldWork"/> Other blood tests include [[ferritin|iron levels]], [[blood glucose]], bicarbonate, and [[kidney function|electrolytes]].<ref name="McDonaldWork"/> Endoscopic examination of the nasal passages may be needed.<ref name="McDonaldWork"/>

===Imaging===

==Prevention==
Preventive measures include wearing a face mask in dusty areas, washing hands, avoiding direct contact with water-damaged buildings, and protecting skin, feet, and hands where there is exposure to soil or manure, such as gardening or certain outdoor work.<ref name=CDC2021Prev/> In high risk groups, such as organ transplant patients, [[antifungal drug]]s may be given as a preventative.<ref name=CDC2021Prev/>

Treatment involves a combination of [[antifungal drugs]], [[Debridement|surgically removing infecting tissue]] and correcting underlying medical problems, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.<ref name=Chand2018/>

===Medication===

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic in India]], the Indian government reported that more than 11,700 people were receiving care for mucormycosis as of 25 May 2021. Many Indian media outlets called it "black fungus" because of the black discoloration of dead and dying tissue the fungus causes. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of mucormycosis in India were estimated to be about 70 times higher than in the rest of the world.<ref name="Dyer2021" /><ref name="'Black fungus' is creating a whole other health emergency for Covid-stricken India">{{cite news | vauthors = Schwartz I, Chakrabarti A |title='Black fungus' is creating a whole other health emergency for Covid-stricken India |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/02/black-fungus-covid-india-mucormycosis |access-date=3 June 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=2 Jun 2021}}</ref> Due to its rapidly growing number of cases some Indian state governments have declared it an [[epidemic]].<ref>{{Cite web | date = 19 May 2021 | vauthors = Wadhawan DW, Jain P, Shrivastava S, Kunal K |title=Rajasthan declares black fungus an epidemic; cases pile up in several states {{!}} 10 points|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/rajasthan-declares-black-fungus-an-epidemic-cases-pile-up-in-several-states-10-points-1804470-2021-05-19|access-date=2021-05-20|website=India Today|language=en}}</ref> One treatment was a daily injection for eight weeks of anti-fungal intravenous injection of amphotericin B which was in short supply.

===Recurrence of mucormycosis during COVID-19 second wave in India===
Pre-COVID mucormycosis was a very rare infection, even in India. It is so rare that an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT (ear, nose, throat)]] doctor would not witness often  a case during their university time. So, the documentation available on the treatment of mucormycosis is limited. In fact, there used to be a couple of mucormycosis expert ENT surgeons for millions of people pre-pandemic. The sudden rise in mucormycosis cases has left a majority of the ENT doctors with no option but to accept mucormycosis cases, as the expert doctors were very much occupied and the patient would die if left untreated. The majority of the ENT doctors had to manage with minimal or no experience on mucormycosis, this has led to the recurrence of mucormycosis in the patients they treated. When a highly experienced doctor in mucormycosis treats a patient even he cannot guarantee that the individual is completely cured and will not have a relapse of mucormycosis; an inexperienced ENT surgeon will definitely have a high number of patients with recurrence due to which there were many recurrent cases of mucormycosis although it did not get the limelight of media or the Indian Government.

==History==
The first case of mucormycosis was possibly one described by [[Friedrich Küchenmeister]] in 1855.<ref name="Chand2018">{{cite book | vauthors = Chander J |title=Textbook of Medical Mycology |date=2018 |publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers Ltd |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-93-86261-83-0 |edition=4th|pages=534–596 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLpEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA554 |language=en |chapter=26.

In 1953, ''[[Saksenaea vasiformis]]'', found to cause several cases, was isolated from Indian forest soil, and in 1979, P. C. Misra examined soil from an Indian mango orchard, from where they isolated ''Apophysomyces'', later found to be a major cause of mucormycosis.<ref name="Chand2018"/> Several species of mucorales have since been described.<ref name="Chand2018"/> When cases were reported in the United States in the mid-1950s, the author thought it to be a new disease resulting from the use of [[antibiotic]]s, [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] and [[Corticosteroid|steroids]].<ref name="Yamin"/><ref name="Baker1957">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker RD | title = Mucormycosis; a new disease? | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 163 | issue = 10 | pages = 805–8 | date = March 1957 | pmid = 13405736 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1957.02970450007003 }}</ref> Until the latter half of the 20th century, the only available treatment was [[potassium iodide]].

=== Naming ===
Arnold Paltauf coined the term "''Mycosis Mucorina''" in 1885, after describing a case with systemic symptoms involving the sinus, brain and gastrointestinal tract, following which the term "mucormycosis" became popular.<ref name="Chand2018"/> "Mucormycosis" is often used interchangeably with "[[zygomycosis]]", a term made obsolete following [[Taxonomy (biology)|changes in classification]] of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Fungi]]. The former [[phylum]] [[Zygomycota]] included Mucorales, [[Entomophthorales]], and others.
