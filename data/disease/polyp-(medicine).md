A '''polyp''' is an abnormal growth of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] projecting from a [[mucous membrane]]. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated [[Peduncle (anatomy)|stalk]], it is said to be ''pedunculated''; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be ''sessile''. Polyps are commonly found in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[stomach]], [[human nose|nose]], [[ear]], [[Paranasal sinus|sinus(es)]], [[urinary bladder]], and [[uterus]]. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the [[cervix]], [[vocal folds]], and [[small intestine]]. Some polyps are tumors ([[neoplasm]]s) and others are non-neoplastic, for example [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] or [[dysplasia|dysplastic]], which are benign. The neoplastic ones are usually [[benign tumor|benign]], although some can be [[precancerous condition|pre-malignant]], or concurrent with a malignancy.

The name is of ancient origin, in use in English from about 1400 for a [[nasal polyp]], from Latin {{Lang|la|polypus}} through Greek.<ref>{{Cite OED|polyp|id=147279}}</ref> The animal of similar appearance called [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]] is attested from 1742, although the word was earlier used for an [[octopus]].

===Colorectal polyp===
{{main|Colorectal polyp }}
While colon polyps are not commonly associated with symptoms, occasionally they may cause [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]], and on rare occasions [[pain]], [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Colonic Polyps|url=https://medlineplus.gov/colonicpolyps.html|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> They are a concern because of the potential for [[colon cancer]] being present microscopically, and the risk of [[Benign tumor|benign]] colon polyps becoming [[Malignancy|malignant]] over time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Colon polyps – Symptoms and causes|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> Since most polyps are [[Symptom#Types|asymptomatic]], they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are [[faecal occult blood|occult blood test]], [[colonoscopy]] with a modern flexible [[Endoscopy|endoscope]], [[sigmoidoscopy]] (usually with the older rigid endoscope), [[lower gastrointestinal series]] (barium enema), [[Rectal examination|digital rectal examination]] (DRE), [[virtual colonoscopy]] or Cologuard.<ref name="AGAfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Gastroenterological Association |author1-link = American Gastroenterological Association |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Gastroenterological Association]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AGA.pdf |access-date = August 17, 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120809143636/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AGA.pdf |archive-date = August 9, 2012 }}</ref> The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy, either with a wire loop known as a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deyhle P |title=Results of endoscopic polypectomy in the gastrointestinal tract |journal=Endoscopy |issue=Suppl |pages=35–46 |year=1980 |pmid=7408789 }}</ref> or with biopsy [[forceps]].  If an [[adenomatous]] polyp is found, it must be removed, since such a polyp is pre-cancerous and has a propensity to become cancerous. For certainty, all polyps which are found by any [[Medical imaging|diagnostic modality]], are removed by a colonoscopy. Although colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5&nbsp;cm, all polyps found are removed since their removal reduces the likelihood of future colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed three to five years later.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Most colon polyps can be categorized as sporadic.

{{main|Familial adenomatous polyposis}}

'''Adenomatous polyps''', or adenomas, are polyps that grow on the lining of the colon and which carry a high risk of [[cancer]]. The adenomatous polyp is considered [[pre-malignant]], i.e., likely to develop into [[colon cancer]].<ref name="A1">{{cite web |url=http://www.gicare.com/endoscopy-center/adenomatous-polyps.aspx |title=Adenomatous Polyps |access-date=2010-04-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206143547/http://www.gicare.com/endoscopy-center/adenomatous-polyps.aspx |archive-date=2010-02-06 }}</ref> The other types of polyps that can occur in the colon are [[hyperplastic]] and inflammatory polyps, which are unlikely to develop into [[colorectal cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Colon Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/colon/Patient/page1/AllPages|website=NCI|access-date=29 June 2014|date=2014-05-12|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705111552/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/colon/Patient/page1/AllPages|archive-date=July 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

About 5% of people aged 60 will have at least one adenomatous polyp of 1&nbsp;cm diameter or greater.<ref name="B2">{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/colonpolyps.htm |title=Polyps in the colon (large bowel)| access-date=2010-04-13}}</ref> Multiple adenomatous polyps often result from [[familial polyposis coli]] or [[familial adenomatous polyposis]], a condition that carries a very high risk of colon cancer.<ref name="Familial Adenomatous Polyposis"/>

====Types====
Adenomas constitute approximately 10% of digestive polyps. Most polyps (approximately 90%) are small, usually less than 1&nbsp;cm in diameter, and have a small potential for malignancy. The remaining 10% of adenomas are larger than 1&nbsp;cm and approach a 10% chance of containing invasive cancer.<ref name="C3">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/172674-overview |title=Colonic Polyps| access-date=2010-04-13}}</ref>

There are three types of adenomatous polyp:
* Tubular adenomas (tube-like shape) are the most common of the adenomatous polyps; they may occur everywhere in the colon and they are the least likely colon polyps to develop into colon cancer
* [[Tubulovillous]]
* Villous adenomas are commonly found in the rectal area and they are normally larger in size than the other two types of adenomas. They tend to be non-[[pedunculated]], velvety, or cauliflower-like in appearance and they are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all polyps. They can cause hypersecretory syndromes characterized by [[hypokalemia]] and profuse [[mucus|mucous]] discharge, and can harbor [[carcinoma in situ]] or invasive carcinoma more frequently than other adenomas.

====Risks====
The risks of progression to colorectal cancer increase if the polyp is larger than 1&nbsp;cm and contains a higher percentage of [[Intestinal villus|villous]] component. Also, the shape of the polyps is related to the risk of progression into carcinoma. Polyps that are [[pedunculated]] (with a stalk) are usually less dangerous than sessile polyps (flat polyps). Sessile polyps have a shorter pathway for migration of invasive cells from the tumor into submucosal and more distant structures, and they are also more difficult to remove and ascertain. Sessile polyps larger than 2&nbsp;cm usually contain villous features, have a higher malignant potential, and tend to recur following colonoscopic polypectomy.<ref name="D4">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssat.com/cgi-bin/polyps.cgi |title=Management of Colonic Polyps and Adenomas |access-date=2010-04-13}}</ref>

Although polyps do not carry significant risk of [[colon cancer]], tubular adenomatous polyps may become cancerous when they grow larger. Larger tubular adenomatous polyps have an increased risk of malignancy when larger because then they develop more villous components and may become [[Sessility (medicine)|sessile]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Taherian |first=Mehran |title=Tubular Adenoma |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553180/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-03-31 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=31985973 |last2=Lotfollahzadeh |first2=Saran |last3=Daneshpajouhnejad |first3=Parnaz |last4=Arora |first4=Komal}}</ref>

It is estimated that an individual whose parents have been diagnosed with an adenomatous polyp has a 50% greater chance to develop colon cancer than individuals with no [[family history]] of colonic polyps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/colon_polyps/page4.htm#9whatis| title=Colon Polyps (cont.)|access-date= 2010-06-25}}</ref> {{As of|2019}} there is no way to establish the risks of colon polyps of patients with a family history of them. Overall, nearly 6% of the population, regardless of family history, is at risk of developing colon cancer.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

====Screening====
Screening for colonic polyps as well as preventing them has become an important part of the management of the condition. Medical societies have established guidelines for colorectal screening in order to prevent adenomatous polyps and to minimize the chances of developing colon cancer. It is believed that some changes in the diet might be helpful in preventing polyps from occurring, but there is no other way to prevent the polyps from developing into cancerous growths than detecting and removing them.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Colon polyps as they grow can sometimes cause bleeding within the [[intestine]], which can be detected by an occult blood test. According to [[American Cancer Society]] guidelines, people over 50 should have an annual  occult blood test. People in their 50s are recommended to have flexible sigmoidoscopies performed once every 3 to 5 years to detect any abnormal growth which could be an adenomatous polyp. If adenomatous polyps are detected during this procedure, a [[colonoscopy]] is recommended. Medical societies recommend colonoscopies every ten years starting at age 50 as a necessary screening practice for colon cancer.<ref name="AGAfive"/><ref name="coloscreen">{{Cite journal | last1 = Winawer | first1 = S. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = R. | last3 = Rex | first3 = D. | last4 = Bond | first4 = J. | last5 = Burt | first5 = R. | last6 = Ferrucci | first6 = J. | last7 = Ganiats | first7 = T. | last8 = Levin | first8 = T. | last9 = Woolf | first9 = S. | last10 = Johnson | first10 = D. | last11 = Kirk | first11 = L. | last12 = Litin | first12 = S. | last13 = Simmang | first13 = C. | last14 = Gastrointestinal Consortium | first14 = P. | title = Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance: Clinical guidelines and rationale – Update based on new evidence| doi = 10.1053/gast.2003.50044 | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 124 | issue = 2 | pages = 544–560 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12557158 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The screening provides an accurate image of the intestine and also allows the removal of the polyp, if found.

It has been statistically demonstrated that screening programs are effective in reducing the number of deaths caused by colon cancer due to adenomatous polyps. The risk of complications associated with colonoscopies is approximately 0.35 percent, compared to a lifetime risk of developing colon cancer of around 6 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/colonoscopy/p/colonoscopy.htm|title=Colonoscopy Risks|access-date=2010-06-25|archive-date=2012-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118213848/http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/colonoscopy/p/colonoscopy.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> As there is a small likelihood of recurrence, surveillance after polyp removal is recommended.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Nasal polyps==
{{Main|Nasal polyp}}
Nasal polyps are polypoidal masses arising mainly from the [[mucous membrane]]s of the nose and [[paranasal sinus]]es. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany [[allergic]] [[rhinitis]]. They are freely movable and nontender.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Laryngeal polyps==
Polyps on the vocal folds can take on many different forms, and can sometimes result from vocal abuse, although this is not always the cause.  They can occur on one or both vocal folds, and appear as swelling, a bump (similar to a nodule), a stalk-like growth, or a blister-like lesion.  Most polyps are larger than nodules, which are more similar to callouses on the vocal folds. Polyps and nodules can exhibit similar symptoms including hoarseness or breathiness, "rough" or "scratchy" voice, harshness in vocal quality, shooting pain from ear to ear, sensation of having "a lump in the back of the throat", neck pain, decreased pitch range in the voice, and vocal and bodily fatigue.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

If an individual experiences symptoms for more than 2 to 3 weeks, they should see a physician.  For a diagnosis, a thorough evaluation of the voice should include a physical examination, preferably by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor) who specializes in voice, a voice evaluation with a speech-language pathologist (SLP), a neurological examination (in certain cases)
The qualities of the voice that will be evaluated include quality, pitch, loudness, and ability to sustain voicing.  In some cases, an instrumental examination may be performed with an endoscope into the mouth or nose; this gives a clear look at the vocal folds and larynx in general.  In addition to this, a stroboscope (flashing light) may be used to observe the movement of the vocal folds during speech.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Polyps may be treated with medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention.  Surgical intervention involves removing the polyp from the vocal fold.  This approach is only used when the growth(s) are very large or have existed for an extended amount of time.  In children, surgical intervention is rare.  Existing medical problems may be treated in an effort to reduce the strain and negative impact on the vocal cords.  This could include treatment for gastrointestinal reflux disease, allergies, and thyroid problems.  Intervention to stop smoking and reduce stress may also be needed.  Most people receive behavioral intervention, or vocal therapy, from an SLP.  This might involve teaching good vocal hygiene, and reducing or stopping vocal abuse behaviors.  Direct voice treatments may be used to alter pitch, loudness, or breathe support to promote good voicing.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
