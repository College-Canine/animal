'''''Trichuris trichiura''', '''Trichocephalus trichiuris''''' or '''whipworm''', is a [[parasitism|parasitic]] [[nematode|roundworm]] (a type of [[helminth]]) that causes [[trichuriasis]] (a type of [[helminthiasis]] which is one of the [[neglected tropical diseases]]) when it infects a human [[large intestine]]. It is commonly known as the ''whipworm'' which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a [[whip]] with wider "handles" at the posterior end.<ref>EMedicine|article|788570|Trichuris Trichiura</ref>

== Life cycle ==
[[File:Trichuris trichiura Life Cycle.tif|thumb|Life cycle of Trichuris trichiura inside and outside the human body]]

The female ''T. trichiura'' produces 2,000–10,000 single-celled eggs per day.<ref name="Books">{{cite book |first1=John H. |last1=Cross |chapter=Enteric Nematodes of Humans |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8261/ |editor1-first=Samuel |editor1-last=Baron |year=1996 |title=Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |location=Galveston |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |isbn=978-0-9631172-1-2}}</ref> Eggs are deposited from human feces to soil where, after two to three weeks, they become embryonated and enter the "infective" stage. These embryonated infective eggs are ingested by hand-mouth or through [[Fomite|fomites]] and hatch in the human [[small intestine]], exploiting the intestinal microflora as a stimulus to hatching.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=K.

The infective [[larva]]e penetrate the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and continue to develop in the small intestine. The young worms move to the [[caecum]] and penetrate the [[mucosa]], and there they complete development as adult worms in the [[large intestine]]. The life cycle from the time of ingestion of eggs to the development of mature worms takes approximately three months. During this time, there may be limited signs of infection in stool samples, due to a lack of egg production and shedding. The female ''T. trichiura'' begin to lay eggs after three months of maturity. Worms commonly live for about one year,<ref name="cdc.gov">{{Cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/whipworm/ | title=CDC - Trichuriasis| date=2019-04-25}}</ref> during which time females can lay up to 20,000 eggs per day.

''Trichuris trichiura'' is a roundworm that infects the intestines.<ref name="cdc.gov" /> It can cause various symptoms and has been known to lead to death.{{cn|date=November 2021}} ''Trichuris trichiura'' lives in the soil in its egg stage. Once it is ingested, it develops into the larvae stage, finally maturing into the adult stage in the intestines.<ref>Citation error.

Recent studies using genome-wide scanning revealed that two quantitative trait loci on [[chromosome 9]] and [[chromosome 18]] may be responsible for a genetic predisposition or susceptibility to infection of ''T. trichiura'' by some individuals.

''Trichuris trichiura'' has a narrow anterior esophageal end and shorter and thicker posterior end. These pinkish-white worms are threaded through the [[mucosa]]. They attach to the host through their slender anterior end and feed on tissue secretions instead of blood. Females are larger than males; approximately 35–50&nbsp;mm long compared to 30–45&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Medterms.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12961 |title=Trichuris trichiura definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2000-04-15 |access-date=2009-05-19}}</ref> The females have a bluntly round posterior end compared to their male counterparts with a coiled posterior end. Their characteristic eggs are barrel-shaped and brown, and have bipolar protuberances.

==Infection==
{{Main|Trichuriasis}}
[[Trichuriasis]], also known as ''whipworm infection,'' occurs through ingestion of whipworm eggs and is more common in warmer climates. Whipworm eggs are passed in the feces of infected persons, and if an infected person [[open defecation|defecates outdoors]] or if untreated human feces is used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil where they can mature into an infective stage.<ref name="cdc.gov"/> Ingestion of these eggs "can happen when hands or fingers that have contaminated dirt on them are put in the mouth or by consuming vegetables or fruits that have not been carefully cooked, washed or peeled."<ref name="cdc.gov"/> The eggs hatch in the small intestine, then move into the wall of the small intestine and develop. On reaching adulthood, the thinner end (the anterior of the worm) burrows into the large intestine, the thicker (posterior) end projecting into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], where it mates with nearby worms. The females can grow to {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Books" />

''Trichuris trichiura'' can cause the serious disease Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS), with chronic dysentery, anemia, rectal prolapse, and poor growth.<ref name=":0" /> TDS is treated with [[anthelminthics]] as well as iron supplementation for anemia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=L.S. |last2=Holland |first2=C.V. |last3=Cooper |first3=E.S. |title=The public health significance of Trichuris trichiura |journal=Parasitology |volume=121 |issue=S1 |pages=S73–S95 |doi=10.1017/S0031182000006867 |pmid=11386693 |year=2000 |hdl=2262/40190 |s2cid=7979360 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Whipworm commonly infects patients also infected with ''[[Giardia]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'', and [[hookworm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Otzi {{!}} Discovery & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Otzi |access-date=2022-06-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Treatment==
''Trichuris trichiura'' can be treated with a single dose of [[albendazole]].<ref>Stephenson, Lani S., et al. “Treatment with a Single Dose of Albendazole Improves Growth of Kenyan Schoolchildren with Hookworm, Trichuris Trichiura, and Ascaris Lumbricoides Infections.” The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 1 July 1989, www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.1989.41.78.</ref> In Kenya, half of a group of children who had ''Trichuris trichiura'' were given albendazole, while the other half of the children received placebos. It was found that the children who received the drug grew significantly better than the group of children who did not receive the treatment.{{cn|date=November 2021}} Another treatment that can be used is [[mebendazole]], or [[flubendazole]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heyer |first1=F. |last2=Tourte-Schaeffer |first2=Cl. |last3=Ancelle |first3=T. |last4=Faurant |first4=Cl. |last5=Lapierre |first5=J. |title=Le flubendazole : un progrès dans le traitement des helminthiases intestinales.

==Epidemiology==
There is a worldwide distribution of ''Trichuris trichiura'', with an estimated 1 billion human infections.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crompton |first1=DW |title=How much human helminthiasis is there in the world? |journal=The Journal of Parasitology |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=397–403 |year=1999 |pmid=10386428 |doi=10.2307/3285768|jstor=3285768 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Silva |first1=Nilanthi R |last2=Brooker |first2=Simon |last3=Hotez |first3=Peter J |last4=Montresor |first4=Antonio |last5=Engels |first5=Dirk |last6=Savioli |first6=Lorenzo |title=Soil-transmitted helminth infections: updating the global picture |journal=Trends in Parasitology |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=547–51 |year=2003 |pmid=14642761 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2003.10.002 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Trichuris trichiura">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/medical/trichuris_trichiura.htm |title=Trichuris trichiura |publisher=WrongDiagnosis.com |date=2009-05-06 |access-date=2009-05-19}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=L.S.|last2=Holland|first2=C.V.|last3=Cooper|first3=E.S.|date=15 June 2001|title=The public health significance of ''Trichuris trichiura''|url=http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/40190/1/The%20public%20health%20significance%20of%20Trichuris%20trichiura.pdf|journal=Parasitology|volume=121|issue=S1|pages=S73–S95|doi=10.1017/S0031182000006867|pmid=11386693|hdl-access=free|hdl=2262/40190|s2cid=7979360|author1-link=Lani Stephenson }}</ref> However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America. Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2.2 million people are thought to be infected. Poor hygiene is associated with [[trichuriasis]] as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated. Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk. Eggs are infective about 2–3 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution.

A closely related species, ''Trichuris suis'', which typically infects pigs, is capable of infecting humans. This shows that the two species have very close evolutionary histories. However, morphology and developmental stages remain different, making them two separate species.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beer |first1=RJ |title=The relationship between Trichuris trichiura (Linnaeus 1758) of man and Trichuris suis (Schrank 1788) of the pig. |journal=Research in Veterinary Science |date=January 1976 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |pmid=1257627 |doi=10.1016/S0034-5288(18)33478-7 }}</ref>

==Treatment of inflammatory disorders==
{{Main|Helminthic therapy}}
The [[hygiene hypothesis]] suggests that various immunological disorders that have been observed in humans only within the last 100 years, such as [[Crohn's disease]], or that have become more common during that period as hygienic practices have become more widespread, may result from a lack of exposure to parasitic worms ([[helminths]]) during childhood.
