[[File:Gray1105.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of a dog's pancreas. Cell-islet in the illustration refers to a pancreatic cell in the [[Islets of Langerhans]], which contain insulin-producing [[beta cell]]s and other endocrine related cells. Permanent damage to these beta cells results in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]], or insulin-dependent diabetes, for which [[exogenous]] insulin replacement therapy is the only answer.]]

'''[[Diabetes mellitus]]''' is a disease in which the [[beta cell]]s of the [[endocrine pancreas]] either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The disease can affect humans as well as animals such as dogs.

The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending on the origin of the condition: type 1 and type 2. 

* [[Type 1 diabetes]], sometimes called "juvenile diabetes", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the [[pancreas]]. The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning [[exogenous]] insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Type 1 is the most common form of diabetes in dogs and affects approximately 0.34% of [[Dog|dogs]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattin|first1=M.|last2=O'Neill|first2=D.|last3=Church|first3=D.|last4=McGreevy|first4=P.

== Checkups ==
Although the symptoms of diabetes mellitus such as frequent urination, thirstiness, greater appetites and inactiveness are easily visible, frequent checking of the dog for the disease is required. The dog's body weight should be determined and calculated once every two weeks using weight scale.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ingadottir|first1=Brynja|last2=Halldorsdottir|first2=Sigridur|date=2008-03-12|title=To Discipline a "Dog": The Essential Structure of Mastering Diabetes|journal=Qualitative Health Research|volume=18|issue=5|pages=606–619|doi=10.1177/1049732308316346|pmid=18420535|s2cid=140787|issn=1049-7323}}</ref> The daily caloric requirement by the dog's body and BCS should also be determined using a scale as part of dietary management in maintaining average body weight. The protein intake by the dog should also be considered and checked twice a month.

Blood pressure of the dog should also be constantly and daily checked in order to predict any future occurrence. The blood sugar level may also be checked using glucometer to check the glucose level in the body of the dog.

Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce the incidence of complications such as [[cataracts]] and [[neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southpaws.com/news/99-2-neuropathy.htm |title=Peripheral Neuropathy |author=Daydrell-Hart, Betsy |year=1999 |publisher=Southpaws |access-date=16 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131063920/http://www.southpaws.com/news/99-2-neuropathy.htm |archive-date=January 31, 2009 }}</ref> Since dogs are insulin dependent, [[Anti-diabetic drug|oral diabetes drugs]], which require a functional [[endocrine pancreas]] with beta cells capable of producing insulin, are ineffective.<ref name = "Greco" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=627| title =Insulin Alternatives|author= Brooks, Wendy C.|publisher= Veterinary Partner|access-date= 17 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/us/diabetes/page.aspx?cat=7001&id=7389|title=Diet for Diabetic Dogs, and Exercise Tips|author=BD Diabetes|publisher= BD Diabetes|access-date=17 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="Type 1"/> Diabetic dogs require [[insulin therapy]],<ref name= "AAHA"/> which must be continued for life.<ref name="Greco"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/badcom/index.html |title=When the Target Ignores the Signal |publisher=University of Utah Genetic Learning Center |access-date=11 June 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307071616/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/badcom/index.html |archive-date=March 7, 2012 }}</ref>

The goal of treatment is to regulate blood glucose using insulin and some probable diet and daily routine changes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.k9diabetes.com/regulated.html |title=What Is Regulated?|author= k9diabetes.com |publisher=k9diabetes.com |access-date=17 March 2010}}</ref> The process may take a few weeks or many months and is similar as in type 1 diabetic humans.

During the initial process of regulation and periodically thereafter, the effectiveness of the insulin dose at controlling blood glucose is evaluated.<ref name="Vetstream"/> This is done by a series of blood glucose tests called a curve.  Blood samples are taken and tested at intervals of one to two hours over a 12- or 24-hour period.<ref name = "AAHA"/><ref name=CurvesUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetsulin.com/vet/Monitoring_About.aspx|title=Blood Glucose Curves|publisher=Intervet US|access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=CurvesUK>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet-diabetes.co.uk/blood-glucose-dogs.asp|title= About Blood Glucose Curves|publisher=Intervet UK|access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref> The results are generally transferred into graph form for easier interpretation. They are compared against the feeding and insulin injection times for judgment.<ref name="Vetstream"/> The curve provides information regarding the action of the insulin in the animal. It is used to determine insulin dose adjustments, determine lowest and highest blood glucose levels, discover insulin duration and, in the case of continued hyperglycemia, whether the cause is insufficient insulin dose or [[Chronic Somogyi rebound|Somogyi rebound]], where blood glucose levels initially reach hypoglycemic levels and are brought to hyperglycemic ones by the body's [[counterregulatory hormone]]s.<ref name=Chronolab/><ref name=Feeney/> Curves also provide evidence of insulin resistance which may be caused by medications other than insulin or by disorders other than diabetes which further testing can help identify.<ref name=CurvesUS/><ref name=CurvesUK/><ref name =Australia>{{Cite web |url=http://www.caninsulin.com/|title=Caninsulin |publisher=Intervet|access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref>

Other diagnostic tests to determine the level of diabetic control are [[fructosamine]] and [[glycated hemoglobin]] (GHb) blood tests which can be useful especially if stress may be a factor.<ref name=Monitor>{{cite web |url=http://www.vetsulin.com/vet/Monitoring_Glycated.aspx|title=Monitoring and controlling diabetes mellitus |publisher=Intervet|access-date=3 October 2011}}</ref> While anxiety or stress may influence the results of blood or urine glucose tests, both of these tests measure glycated proteins, which are not affected by them. Fructosamine testing provides information about blood glucose control for an approximate 2- to 4-week period, while GHb tests measure a 2- to 4-month period.

'''Continuous glucose monitoring'''

Some veterinarians are using continuous monitoring as part of the dog's treatment plan (2019). Sensors intended for humans, e.g. Abbot labs Freestyle Libre, can be applied and provide direct measurement of glucose levels eliminating the need for daily urine or blood checks.

[[Ketone bodies|Ketones]] in the urine or blood, as detected by [[clinistrip|urine strips]] or a blood ketone testing meter, may indicate the beginning of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), a dangerous and often quickly fatal condition caused by high glucose levels ([[hyperglycemia]]) and low insulin levels combined with certain other systemic stresses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/d_0i_191.htm |title=Blood Ketone Testing Meter--Abbott's Precision Xtra |publisher=Children With Diabetes |access-date=17 March 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144758/http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/d_0i_191.htm |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Hanas2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/presentations/06-cwd-sick-days_files/frame.htm |title=Ketones Increase With Lack of Insulin |author=Hanas, Ragnar |publisher=Children With Diabetes |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144803/http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/presentations/06-cwd-sick-days_files/frame.htm |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref> DKA can be arrested if caught quickly.

===Nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome===
Nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome (also known as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome) is a rare but extremely serious complication of untreated canine diabetes, which is a medical emergency. It shares the symptoms of extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the body does not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source and there is no ketone production.<ref name=Endocrine/> There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic ketoacidosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vetsulin.com/vet/Diagnosis_Hyperosmolar.aspx |title=Treating hyperosmolar syndrome |publisher=Intervet|access-date=20 June 2011}}</ref> Seizures and coma are possible.<ref name=Crises>{{cite web |url=http://veterinarycalendar.dvm360.com/diabetic-crises-recognition-and-management-proceedings|title=Diabetic crises: Recognition and management (Proceedings)|author=Macintyre, Douglass|date=1 August 2008|publisher=DVM 360|access-date=20 June 2011}}</ref> Treatment is similar to that of ketoacidosis, with the exceptions being that NHS requires that the blood glucose levels and rehydration be normalized at a slower rate than for DKA; [[cerebral edema]] is possible if the treatment progresses too rapidly.<ref name=Endocrine/>

Some common reasons for hypoglycemia include increased or unplanned exercise, illness, or medication interactions, where another medication [[wiktionary:potentiate|potentiates]] the effects of the insulin.<ref name = "Emergencies" /><ref name = "Foster" /> [[Vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] episodes can bring on a hypoglycemia reaction, due to dehydration or simply a case of too much insulin and not enough properly digested food.<ref name = "Vetsulin">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vetsulin.com/vet/AboutDiabetes_Glucose.aspx |title=Hypoglycemia |author=Vetsulin|publisher=Intervet |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="UK">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cat-dog-diabetes.com/dogs-hypoglycaemia.asp |title=Hypoglycaemia|author=Cat-Dog-Diabetes|publisher= Intervet (UK) |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> Symptoms of hypoglycemia need to be taken seriously and addressed promptly. Since serious hypoglycemia can be fatal, it is better to treat a suspected incident than to fail to respond quickly to the signs of actual hypoglycemia.<ref name="Pierce">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahofp.com/Guide/Candiabe.htm  |title=Definition of Hypoglycemic values|author=Pierce County Animal Emergency Clinic|publisher=Animal Hospital of Pierce County|access-date=17 March 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512122940/http://www.ahofp.com/Guide/Candiabe.htm |archive-date = 12 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.novonordisk.com.au/Diabetes_Graphics/2008files/HypoPages_08.pdf |title=Hypoglycemia |publisher=Novo Nordisk |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110610/http://www.novonordisk.com.au/Diabetes_Graphics/2008files/HypoPages_08.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2011 }} ([[PDF]])</ref><ref name = "Jasmine">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAZxhIGNnY4  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229105220/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAZxhIGNnY4 |archive-date=2013-12-29 |publisher=YouTube |title=video of Jasmine, a canine diabetic, showing signs of hypoglycemia that progress into a hypoglycemic seizure}}</ref> Dr. Audrey Cook addressed the issue in her 2007 article on diabetes mellitus: "Hypoglycemia is deadly; hyperglycemia is not.

Successful home treatment of a hypoglycemia event depends on being able to recognize the symptoms early and responding quickly with treatment.<ref name = "Foster" /> Trying to make a seizing or unconscious animal swallow can cause choking on the food or liquid. There is also a chance that the materials could be [[Aspiration pneumonia|aspirated]] (enter the lungs instead of being swallowed).<ref name = "Emergencies"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121615.htm&word=aspiration|title=Pneumonia|publisher=Merck Veterinary Manual|access-date=19 April 2011}}</ref> Seizures or loss of consciousness because of low blood glucose levels are medical emergencies.<ref name = "Emergencies" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canine-epilepsy.com/underlying.html#anchor700068 |title=Hypoglycemia|author=Thomas, WB|publisher=University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

====Treatment====
Food should be offered at the first signs of possible hypoglycemia.  If the animal refuses it, a sugar solution ([[corn syrup]], [[honey]], [[Maple syrup|pancake syrup]], etc.) should be poured on the finger and rubbed on its gums or under the tongue ([[Sublingual administration|sublingually]]). The solution must be applied this way to prevent possible aspiration of it.<ref name = "Emergencies" /><ref name="UK"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/images/articles/53420dog_apply_syrup.jpg |title=Photo illustrating how to rub sugar solution on an animal's gums|publisher=Drs. Foster & Smith Pet Education|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> Intervet suggests one tablespoon of a sugar solution rubbed onto the gums, regardless of the size of the dog.<ref name = "Emergencies" /> Another hypoglycemia formula is 1&nbsp;gram of glucose for every kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) of the animal's body weight.<ref name = "Vetsulin" /><ref name = "Caninsulin" /> Since sugar acts quickly, a response should be seen within a minute or two.<ref name = "Emergencies" />

Honey, syrup, or sugar, as [[simple carbohydrates]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbs-information.com/simple-carbohydrates.htm |title=Carbs Information-simple carbohydrates|publisher=Carbs Information|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> act rapidly and will make the blood glucose rise, but the rise will not last very long, as they are broken down quickly by the body.<ref name = "BD">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/us/diabetes/main.aspx?cat=7001&id=7399 |title=Hypoglycemia in Dogs|publisher=BD Diabetes|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> Feeding something containing  [[Carbohydrate#Nutrition|complex carbohydrates]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weightlossforall.com/complex-carbs.htm |title=Complex Carbohydrates|publisher=Weight Loss for All|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbs-information.com/complex-carbohydrates.htm |title=Carbs Information-complex carbohydrates|publisher=Carbs Information|access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> when the pet is able to eat will make sure another hypoglycemia event does not overtake the rapid rise in blood glucose levels from the sugar solution.

Dietary management in food service is also essential in preventing diabetes attack. A dietary management may include low fat content foods, complex carbohydrates that aid in slowing down glucose absorption, protein and fiber.
