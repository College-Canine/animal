'''Cocker Spaniels''' are dogs belonging to two breeds of the [[spaniel]] [[dog type]]: the [[American Cocker Spaniel]] and the [[English Cocker Spaniel]], both of which are commonly called simply '''Cocker Spaniel''' in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting spaniels.

Cocker Spaniels were originally bred as hunting dogs in the [[UK]], with the term "cocker" deriving from their use to hunt the [[Eurasian woodcock]]. When the breed was brought to the [[United States]], it was bred to a different [[Breed standard (dogs)|standard]], which enabled it to specialize in hunting the [[American woodcock]]. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during the early part of the 20th century.

Spaniels were first mentioned in the 14th century by [[Gaston III, Count of Foix]] in his work the ''Livre de Chasse''. The "cocking" or "cocker spaniel" was a type of field or land spaniel in the 19th century. Prior to 1901, Cocker Spaniels were only separated from [[Field Spaniel]]s and [[English Springer Spaniel|Springer Spaniel]]s by weight. Two dogs are considered to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds, the English variety are descended from [[Championship (dog)|Ch.]] Obo, while the American breed descends from Obo's son, Ch. [[Obo II]]. In the United States, the English Cocker was recognized as separate from the native breed in 1946; in the UK, the American type was recognized as a separate breed in 1970. In addition, a second strain of English Cocker Spaniel, a working strain, is not bred to a standard, but to working ability. Both breeds share similar coat colors and health issues with a few exceptions.

==History==

While their origins are unknown, "spaynels" are mentioned in 14th-century writings.<ref name="such7">[[#sucher99|Sucher (1999)]]: p. 7</ref> They are commonly assumed to have originated in [[Spain]], and [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York]] in his 15th-century work ''[[The Master of Game]]'' introduces them as "Another kind of hound there is that be called hounds for the hawk and spaniels, for their kind cometh from Spain, notwithstanding that there are many in other countries."<ref name="york119">[[#york1909|York (1909)]]: p. 119</ref> ''The Master of Game'' was mostly an [[English language|English]] translation of an earlier 14th century [[Old French]] work by [[Gaston III of Foix-BÃ©arn]] entitled ''Livre de Chasse''.<ref name="yorkxii">[[#york1909|York (1909)]]: p. xii</ref>

In 1801, [[Sydenham Edwards]] wrote in ''Cynographia Britannica'' that the "Land Spaniel" is divided into two types: the hawking, springing/springer and the cocking/cocker spaniel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=A.C.|title=Gun Dogs - Their Training, Working and Management|year=1932|publisher=Seeley, Service & Co.|location=London|page=89}}</ref> The term "cocker" came from the dog's use in hunting [[woodcock]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Case|first=Linda P.|title=The Dog: Its Behavior, Nutrition, and Health|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Ames, Iowa|year=2005|edition=2nd|page=32|isbn=978-0-8138-1254-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2e_AToP1yREC&q=cocker+spaniel&pg=RA1-PA32}}</ref> During the 19th century, a "cocker spaniel" was a type of small Field Spaniel; at the time, this term referred to a number of different [[spaniel]] hunting breeds, including the [[Norfolk Spaniel]], [[Sussex Spaniel]], and [[Clumber Spaniel]]. While no Sussex Cockers or Clumber Cockers existed, some dogs were known as Welsh Cockers and Devonshire Cockers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=John Henry|title=The Dogs Of Great Britain, America, And Other Countries.

Prior to the 1870s, the only requirement for a dog to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than {{convert|25|lb|kg}}, although breeders separated the cocker from the [[King Charles Spaniel]], which remains a smaller breed of spaniel.<ref name="such8">[[#sucher99|Sucher (1999)]]: p. 8</ref> This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels.<ref name="dusting">{{cite web|url=http://www.spanieljournal.com/bkolehouse.html|title=Dusting Off History to Look at Cocker Hunting Tradition|last=Kolehouse|first=Bobbie|publisher=Spaniel Journal|access-date=26 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215005015/http://www.spanieljournal.com/bkolehouse.html|archive-date=15 February 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by [[John Henry Walsh]] under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book ''The Dog in Health and Disease'' as being a deeper shade of liver than that of the Sussex Spaniel.<ref>[[#walsh87|Walsh (1887)]]: p. 109</ref> Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the [[UK]] in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers.

Two dogs are thought to be the foundation sires of both modern breeds of cocker spaniels. Ch. Obo is considered by breed enthusiasts to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel, while his son, Ch. [[Obo II]], is considered to be the progenitor of the American Cocker Spaniel.<ref name="pal21"/> Obo was born in 1879, when registration as a cocker was still only by size and not by ancestry. He was the son of a Sussex Spaniel and a Field Spaniel.<ref name="dogkennel"/> Although Obo was an English dog, Obo II was born on American shores &ndash; his mother was shipped to the United States while pregnant.<ref name="pal21">[[#Palika2009|Palika (2009)]]: p. 21</ref> During his lifetime, Obo II was claimed in advertisements to be the sire or grandsire of nearly every prize-winning cocker in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asc-cockerspaniel.org/images/history/obostud.pdf|title=Obo II Stud Card|publisher=American Spaniel Club|access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

==Modern breeds==
[[image:Cocker-Graph.svg|thumb|left|alt=A diagram showing the difference in heights and body shapes of two dogs|A graph showing the height and shape difference between the American and English Cocker Spaniel]]

The two breeds of cocker spaniel are the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel.<ref name="riggsbee"/> They were bred as [[gun dog]]s, to use their sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler to flush birds into the air to be shot, and to use their eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to retrieve the bird with a [[soft mouth]]. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head, and a shorter [[Muzzle (animal)|muzzle]], while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.<ref name="riggsbee"/>

Cocker Spaniel [[Coat (dog)|coats]] occur in a variety of colors, including black, liver, red, and golden in solids. Also, black and tan, and sometimes liver and tan are known, as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including [[Roan (color)|roans]], roan and tans, tricolors, and those solid colors with additional white markings.

Rare colours can appear unexpectedly in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, they can still appear very uncommonly to parents that are dark-colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of [[My Own Brucie]], Best in Show at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVUEAAAAMBAJ&q=cocker+spaniel&pg=PA40|title=White Cocker: "Brucie" grandson is rare color|date=13 December 1943|publisher=Life|page=40|access-date=25 April 2010}}</ref>

In its native United States, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked the 23rd-most popular breed according to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, a decrease in popularity since 1999, when it was ranked 13th.<ref name="akcdogreg">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/|title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics|publisher=American Kennel Club|access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref> For 25 years, the American Cocker Spaniel was the most popular dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the English Cocker Spaniel being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952, when [[Beagle]]s became the most popular dogs. It regained the spot in 1983 and held on at number one until 1990.<ref name="akcfactsheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/press-center/facts-stats/?page=popular_pooches|title=AKC Registration Statistics Fact Sheet|publisher=American Kennel Club|access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref> In the UK, the American Cocker Spaniel is far less popular than its English relative, with 322 registrations compared to the English Cocker's 22,211 in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/3075/Quarterly-breed-stats-gundogs.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20081202104605/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/3075/Quarterly-breed-stats-gundogs.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 December 2008 |title=Quarterly Registration Statistics for the Gundog Group |publisher=The Kennel Club |access-date=26 April 2010 }}</ref>

The English Cocker Spaniel is the most successful breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, [[Crufts]], with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928.<ref name="The Telegraph">{{cite news |title=10 things you didn't know about Crufts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-crufts/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-crufts/ |archive-date=2022-01-12 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |website=The Telegraph|date=7 March 2019 |last1=Hogan |first1=Michael }}{{cbignore}}</ref> This was mostly due to the success of dog breeder H.S.

Physical differences exist between the show strain and working strain in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability, and as such, several physical differences have appeared. Working-type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain seems to be more energetic than the show strain.

American Cocker Spaniels were recognized by the AKC in 1878.
