The '''health of dogs''' is a well studied area in [[veterinary medicine]].

Dog health is viewed holistically; it encompasses many different aspects, including disease processes, genetics, and nutritional health, for example. [[Infectious disease]]s that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary standpoint, but also because of the risk to [[public health]]; an example of this is [[rabies]]. [[Genetic disorder]]s also affect dogs, often due to [[selective breeding]] to produce individual dog breeds. Due to the popularity of both commercial and homemade dog foods, nutrition is also a heavily studied subject.

==Diseases==
{{for|a complete list|List of dog diseases}}
Some diseases and other health problems are common to both humans and dogs; others are unique to dogs and other animals.  Dogs are susceptible to various diseases; similarly to humans, they can have [[diabetes]], [[epilepsy]], cancer, or [[arthritis]].

Timely vaccination can reduce the risk and severity of an infection. The most commonly recommended viruses to vaccinate dogs against are:
[[Image:Rabid dog.jpg|thumb|A rabid dog]]
* [[Rabies in animals|Rabies]]
* CDV ([[canine distemper]])
* CAV-2 ([[infectious canine hepatitis|canine hepatitis virus]] or [[infectious canine hepatitis|adenovirus-2]])
* [[Canine herpesvirus]]
* [[Canine influenza]] 
* CPV-2 ([[canine parvovirus]])
*[[Kennel cough]]<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-5827.1989.tb01471.x | title = A field investigation of kennel cough: Efficacy of vaccination | journal = Journal of Small Animal Practice | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 550 | year = 1989 | last1 = Thrusfield | first1 = M.

* [[Leptospirosis]]
* [[Lyme disease]]

===Infectious diseases===
An infectious disease is caused by the presence of organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (either animalian or [[protozoa]]n).  Most of these diseases are spread directly from dog to dog, while others require a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] such as a [[tick]] or [[mosquito]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tick-borne infectious diseases of dogs| pmid=11228013 | volume=17 | issue=2 | journal=Trends Parasitol. | pages=74–80 | last1 = Shaw | first1 = SE | last2 = Day | first2 = MJ | last3 = Birtles | first3 = RJ | last4 = Breitschwerdt | first4 = EB | doi=10.1016/s1471-4922(00)01856-0| year=2001 }}</ref> Certain infectious diseases are a concern from a public health standpoint because they are [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] (transmittable to humans)

====Viral diseases====
[[Virus|Viral]] diseases in dogs can be serious, especially in kennels.

====Bacterial diseases====
[[Image:Leptospira scanning micrograph.jpg|thumb|A number of ''Leptospira'' sp. bacteria atop a 0.1. μm [[polycarbonate]] filter]]
Bacterial diseases in dogs are usually not contagious from dog to dog; instead they are usually the result of wound colonization, [[opportunistic infection]]s secondary to decreased resistance (often the result of viral infections), or secondary to other conditions ([[pyoderma]] secondary to skin allergies or [[pyometra]] secondary to cystic endometrial hyperplasia).  These examples are not considered infectious diseases because they do not satisfy [[Koch's postulates]] – for example ''Staphylococcus intermedius'', a commonly isolated bacteria from skin infections in dogs, would not cause pyoderma when introduced to a healthy dog.  In all likelihood that type of bacteria is already present on the skin of a healthy dog.

There are some bacteria that are contagious from dog to dog.  The most notable of these are ''[[Bordetella bronchiseptica]]'', one of the causes of [[kennel cough]], ''[[Leptospira]]'' sp, which cause [[leptospirosis]],<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klopfleisch R, Kohn B, Plog S, Weingart C, Nöckler K, Mayer-Scholl A, Gruber AD |title=An Emerging Pulmonary Haemorrhagic Syndrome in Dogs: Similar to the Human Leptospiral Pulmonary Haemorrhagic Syndrome? |journal=Vet.

There are also common tick-borne bacterial diseases, including [[Lyme disease]], [[ehrlichiosis (canine)|ehrlichiosis]], and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus ''Leptospira''. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin. In dogs, transmission most commonly occurs by drinking puddle, pond, or ditch water contaminated by urine from infected wildlife such as squirrels or raccoons.  The liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by leptospirosis. [[Vasculitis]] can occur, causing [[edema]] and potentially [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC). [[Myocarditis]], [[pericarditis]], [[meningitis]], and [[uveitis]] are also possible sequelae.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0195-5616(03)00026-3 |author1=Heuter, Kerry J. |author2=Langston, Cathy E. |title=Leptospirosis: A re-emerging zoonotic disease |journal=Vet.

[[Image:Adult deer tick.jpg|thumb|''Ixodes scapularis'']]
Brucellosis in dogs is caused by ''Brucella canis''.  It is a sexually transmitted disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses.  The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth.  Other symptoms include inflammation of the [[intervertebral disc]] and eye ([[uveitis]]), and inflammation of the testicle ([[orchitis]]) and [[prostate]] ([[prostatitis]]) in males.<ref>{{cite web | title = Brucellosis in Dogs: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/112200.htm | access-date = 2007-08-14 }}</ref>

[[Tick-borne disease]]s are common in dogs.  Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' and spread by ''[[Ixodes pacificus]]'' on the West coast of the United States and by ''[[Ixodes scapularis|I. scapularis]]'' (deer tick) in the rest of the U.S.  Signs and symptoms include fever, joint swelling and pain, lameness, and swelling of the lymph nodes.  It has been diagnosed in dogs in all 48 states of the continental U.S.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Lyme disease recognized in 48 states | journal = Vet. Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | page = 17 |date=May 2007 }}</ref>  ''Ehrlichia canis'', which causes canine ehrlichiosis, and ''[[Rickettsia|Rickettsia rickettsii]]'', which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are both spread by the American dog tick, ''[[Dermacentor variabilis]]'', and the brown dog tick, ''[[Rhipicephalus sanguineous]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Forget everything you know about ticks | journal = Vet. Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 44–56 |date=May 2007 }}</ref>

====Fungal diseases====
One of the most common fungal diseases in dogs is [[ringworm]], or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails.  There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs.  About 70 percent of infections are caused by ''[[Microsporum]] canis'', 20 percent by ''M. gypseum'', and 10 percent by ''[[Trichophyton]] mentagrophytes''.  Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin.  Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the clinical course can be shortened by using topical [[miconazole]] or [[clotrimazole]].  Generalized infections, most commonly seen in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] dogs, can be treated with oral [[antifungal drug]]s such as [[griseofulvin]] or [[itraconazole]].  Infection can spread to humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = Dermatophytosis: Dogs and Cats | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/71303.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref>

[[Image:Blastomycosis cropped.JPG|thumb|''Blastomyces dermatitidis'']]
There are several fungal diseases that are systemic in nature, meaning they are affecting multiple body systems. [[Blastomycosis]], caused by ''Blastomyces'' species including ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'', is a fungal disease that affects both dogs and humans. It is transmitted through the inhalation of fungal spores. It is found mainly in the United States in the Mississippi River and Great Lakes areas.  It has also been reported in four Canadian provinces; Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, draining skin lesions, eye inflammation with discharge, blindness, and lameness.  Because dogs are ten times more likely to become infected from the environment than humans, they are considered to be sentinels for the disease.  Treatment requires a minimum 60–90-day course of oral antifungal medication or in severe cases intravenous antifungal injections.<ref>{{cite web | last = Probst | first = Sarah | title = Blastomycosis—Fungal Disease Common in Outdoor Dogs | work = Pet Columns | publisher = [[UIUC College of Veterinary Medicine]] | year = 1999 | url = http://vrrh.org/2015/02/blastomycosis-fungal-disease-common-in-outdoor-dogs/ | access-date = 2007-08-18 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150205080041/http://vrrh.org/2015/02/blastomycosis-fungal-disease-common-in-outdoor-dogs/ | archive-date = 2015-02-05 }}</ref>

[[Histoplasmosis]], caused by ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'', is a disease with a worldwide distribution.  In the United States it is mainly found in the Mississippi and [[Ohio River]] areas, most commonly in bird and bat feces.  Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal symptoms.<ref>{{cite web | title = Histoplasmosis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/51108.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref> [[Coccidioidomycosis]], caused by ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', is found in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions of [[Central America|Central]] and South America, Mexico, and southwestern United States.  Signs include weight loss, fever, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and lameness.<ref>{{cite web | title = Coccidioidomycosis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/51104.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Symptoms of Coccidia| url = http://coccidiaindogs.com/coccidia-in-dogs/symptoms-of-coccidia/ | access-date = 2013-12-14 }}</ref>

====Parasites====
[[Veterinary parasitology]] studies both external and internal [[parasite]]s in animals. External parasites, such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal parasites.

=====External parasites=====
*[[Flea]]s and [[tick]]s of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog, where they can multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). These two parasites are particularly important to note, now that tick-borne [[Lyme disease]] has become [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] throughout a large area, in addition to other similar diseases such as [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. Although dogs do not seem to be as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar [[rickettsia]]l diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rickettsia parkeri Infection in Domestic Dogs, Southern Louisiana, USA, 2011 |url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/12-0165_article |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |year=2012 |doi=10.3201/eid1806.120165 |access-date=12 March 2020|last1=Grasperge |first1=Britton J. |last2=Wolfson |first2=Wendy |last3=MacAluso |first3=Kevin R. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=995–997 |pmid=22607743 |pmc=3358172 }}</ref>
*Various [[mite]]s cause skin problems such as [[mange]].
*[[Mosquito]]s
*Lice infestations ([[pediculosis]]) cause intense [[Itch|pruritus]], scratching, and hair loss. The two species of chewing lice that affect dogs are ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'' and ''Heterodoxus spiniger''. The dog sucking louse is ''Linognathus setosus''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/can-dogs-get-lice/|title=Dog Lice: What They Are, How to Avoid Them|date=February 23, 2016|website=American Kennel Club|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

=====Internal parasites=====
[[File:Dirofilaria-immitis-dog-heart.jpg|thumb|''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' heart worms in a dog's heart]]
*[[parasitism|Parasites]], particularly intestinal worms such as [[hookworm]]s, [[tapeworm]]s and [[Ascaris lumbricoides|roundworms]], can be transmitted in a dog's feces. Some tapeworms have [[flea]]s as intermediate hosts: the worm egg must be consumed by a flea to hatch, then the infected flea must be ingested (usually by the dog while grooming itself, but occasionally by a human through various means) for the adult worm to establish itself in the intestines. The worm's eggs then pass in the feces, and the cycle begins again. Intestinal worms cause varying degrees of discomfort.
*[[Heartworm]] is a dog [[parasitoid]].  It is hard to eliminate and can be fatal; prevention, however, is easily achieved using medication. As the name suggests, an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin, where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the [[pulmonary artery|pulmonary arteries]] and heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The effects on the dog are quite predictable: [[cardiac failure]] leading to death. Treatment of an infected dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with [[arsenic]] compounds without killing the weakened dog, and may not succeed. Prevention is recommended via the use of [[heartworm#Prevention|heartworm prophylactics]], which contain a compound that kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog.  Often they are combined with other parasite preventives.
*[[Hydatidosis]] is caused by the cestode [[Echinococcus]]. It is observed in dogs, wild canids, foxes, etc. Due to its importance as a [[zoonosis]], prevention and treatment is crucial. Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treatment. [[Anthelmintics]] such as [[praziquantel]] may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these [[tapeworm]]s.

===Genetic diseases===

[[Image:Bilateral hip dysplasia.JPG|thumb|Bilateral hip dysplasia]]
[[Genetics|Genetic]] conditions are a problem in some dogs, particularly purebreds. For this reason many of the national [[kennel club]]s require that dogs with certain genetic illnesses or who are deemed to be carriers cannot be registered. Some of the most common conditions include [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] seen in large breed dogs; [[von Willebrand disease]] a disease that affects [[platelet]]s that is inherited in [[Doberman Pinscher]]s; [[entropion]] a curling in of the eyelid seen in [[Shar Pei]]s and many other breeds; [[progressive retinal atrophy]] inherited in many breeds; deafness and [[epilepsy in animals|epilepsy]] known to be inherited in [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuren)|Belgian Shepherd Dogs]], [[German Shepherd Dog]]s, [[Cocker Spaniel]]s, and [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernards]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Canine Inherited Disorders Database | publisher = University of Prince Edward Island | year = 2001 | url = http://www.upei.ca/cidd/intro.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref>
[[Aortic valve stenosis|Subaortic stenosis]], or SAS, is a genetic ailment that causes a narrowing of the passage of blood between the heart and the [[aorta]]. This leads to heart problems and sometimes sudden death. It affects larger breeds such as the [[Newfoundland dog]] and the [[Golden Retriever]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Aortic Stenosis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/11106.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref> In some dogs, such as [[collie]]s, the [[merle (coat colour in dogs)|blue merle]] or [[Great Dane|harlequin]] coloring is actually the [[heterozygote]] of a partially [[recessive]] gene preventing proper development of the nervous system; therefore, if two such dogs are mated, on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in their [[nervous system]]s and [[sensory organ]]s ranging from deafness to fatal flaws.

===Skin diseases===
{{main|Dog skin disorders}}
[[Image:Canine Atopy.jpg|thumb|Canine atopy]]
Skin diseases are very common in dogs. [[Atopy]], a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Canine Atopy | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/70301.htm | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}</ref> Other skin diseases related to allergies include [[Hot spot (veterinary medicine)|hot spots]] and [[pyoderma]], both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, [[Dog Food Allergies|food allergy]], [[Otitis externa in animals|ear infections]], and [[flea allergy dermatitis]]. [[Canine follicular dysplasia]] is an inherited disorder of the [[hair follicle]]s resulting in [[alopecia]] (baldness). [[Mange]] is an infectious skin disease caused by [[mite]]s. [[Endocrine diseases]] such as [[hypothyroidism]] and [[Cushing's syndrome (veterinary)|Cushing's syndrome]] can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of integumentary malady is [[hygroma (canine disease)|hygromas]], a swelling typically on or near the elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin.<ref name=":1" />(See [[dog skin disorders]] for specific nutrients that impacts skin)

Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems, such as wrinkled skin or excessive skin folds. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection more prevalent in breeds such as the bulldog, cocker spaniel, and English Springer spaniel.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Asher|first1=L.|last2=Diesel|first2=G.|last3=Summers|first3=J.F.|last4=McGreevy|first4=P.D.|last5=Collins|first5=L.M.|date=2009-12-01|title=Inherited defects in pedigree dogs.

===Orthopedic diseases===
Orthopedic diseases in dogs can be developmental, hereditary, traumatic, or degenerative.  Because of the active nature of dogs, injuries happen frequently.  One of the most common of these is an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]], a condition which often requires surgery. [[Bone fracture]]s are a frequent occurrence in outdoor dogs due to trauma from being hit by cars. [[Osteoarthritis|Degenerative joint disease]] is common in older dogs and is one of the most likely reasons for prescription of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.

Hereditary orthopedic diseases are mainly found in purebred dogs. [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]] is a common problem that primarily affects larger breeds. Hip dysplasia is a defect in the shape of the hip joint which can, depending on the degree of hip luxation, be quite painful to the dog as it ages. Over time it often causes arthritis in the hips. [[Elbow dysplasia|Dysplasia]] can also occur in the elbow joint. [[Luxating patella]]s can be a problem for smaller breeds. It can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs.

Developmental orthopedic diseases include [[panosteitis]] and [[hypertrophic osteodystrophy]].  Panosteitis occurs in large and giant breed dogs usually between the age of five and fourteen months and manifests as fever, pain, and shifting leg lameness.  Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is also seen in young large and giant breed dogs and is characterized by pain, lameness, fever, and swelling of the long bone [[metaphysis]].

===Tumors and cancer===
{{Main|Cancer in dogs}}
[[Image:KangalWithCancer.jpg|thumb|An emaciated [[Anatolian Shepherd|Kangal]] with cancer in the left foreleg]]
[[Image:Cancer_beagle.jpg|thumb|A 10-year-old female beagle with [[oral cancer]]]]

Both [[Benign tumor|benign]] and [[cancer|malignant]] [[tumor]]s are seen in dogs.  Common benign tumors include [[lipoma]]s, non-viral [[papilloma]]s, [[sebaceous gland]] adenoma, and [[perianal gland adenoma]]s.

Frequently seen cancers include [[lymphoma in animals|lymphoma]], [[melanoma]], [[mast cell tumor]]s (which are considered to be potentially malignant, even though they may have benign behavior),<ref name=MKM>{{cite web | title = Cutaneous Mast Cell Tumors | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72231.htm | access-date = 2007-08-21 }}</ref> and [[osteosarcoma]] (bone cancer).

Certain breeds are more likely to develop particular tumors, larger ones especially.  The [[Golden Retriever]] is especially susceptible to lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 8.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Modiano J, Breen M, Burnett R, Parker H, Inusah S, Thomas R, Avery P, Lindblad-Toh K, Ostrander E, Cutter G, Avery A |title=Distinct B-cell and T-cell lymphoproliferative disease prevalence among dog breeds indicates heritable risk |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=65 |issue=13 |pages=5654–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15994938 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4613|doi-access=free |url=https://aacr.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Supplementary_Figure_1_from_Distinct_B-Cell_and_T-Cell_Lymphoproliferative_Disease_Prevalence_among_Dog_Breeds_Indicates_Heritable_Risk/22364033/1/files/39808256.pdf }}</ref> [[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] and [[pug]]s are prone to multiple mast cell tumors.<ref name=MKM/> [[Scottish terrier]]s have eighteen times the risk of mixed breed dogs to develop [[transitional cell carcinoma]], a type of urinary bladder cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Raghavan M, Knapp DW, Dawson MH, Bonney PL, Glickman LT |title=Topical flea and tick pesticides and the risk of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder in Scottish Terriers |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=225 |issue=3 |pages=389–94 |year=2004 |pmid=15328714 |doi=10.2460/javma.2004.225.389|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Gastrointestinal diseases===
Due to the indiscriminate nature of a dog's appetite, gastrointestinal upset is a frequent occurrence in dogs.  The most common symptoms are anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Foreign body ingestion can lead to acute obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, a very dangerous condition. [[Acute pancreatitis]] can also result from [[dietary indiscretion]].

====Bloat and gastric torsion====
{{main|Gastric dilatation volvulus}}
[[Gastric dilatation volvulus]], or gastric torsion and bloat, primarily affects breeds with deep, narrow chests, such as [[Great Dane]]s, [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernards]], [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Standard Poodle]]s and [[Irish Setter]]s.  The [[stomach]] twists on its supporting [[ligament]]s, sealing off the exits, and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is very painful and rapidly causes [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and [[necrosis]] of large areas of stomach tissue.  It can be fatal within a few hours.  Dogs who have experienced bloat are very susceptible to recurrences. Treatment involves stabilization and abdominal surgery to tack the dog's stomach down to prevent recurrence ([[gastropexy]]).<ref>{{cite web | title = Gastric Dilatation-volvulus | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23305.htm&word=gastric%2ctorsion%2cdogs | access-date = 9 August 2012 }}</ref>

===Eye diseases===
[[Image:Prolapsed gland of the third eyelid.JPG|thumb|Cherry eye]]
Eye diseases are common in dogs. [[Cataract]]s, [[canine glaucoma]], and [[entropion]] are seen in dogs.  Canine-specific eye diseases include [[progressive retinal atrophy]], [[Collie eye anomaly]], [[sudden acquired retinal degeneration]], and [[cherry eye]].  Injury to the eye can result in [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]].

The frequency of bilateral glaucoma with a genetic base in purebred dogs is higher than in any species except humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = Glaucoma | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30111.htm | access-date = 2007-08-26 }}</ref> Cataracts in dogs either have a genetic base or can also be caused by [[Diabetes in dogs|diabetes]]. [[Nuclear sclerosis]] resembles a cataract but is actually a normal age-related change.

===Vestibular disease===
Signs of vestibular disease include head tilt, circling, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (an abnormal movement of the eyes), and difficulty or inability to stand. These clinical signs are similar to those seen in humans experiencing [[vertigo]].  Vestibular disease may have many causes. Elderly dogs are susceptible to an [[idiopathic]] (meaning due to unknown causes) form of vestibular disease commonly called "old dog vestibular disease" or idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. The signs may improve rapidly or take a few days. Less commonly, vestibular signs can also be caused by [[otitis interna|inner ear disease]], a brain tumor, a stroke, or other causes. The major risk with idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease is that the dog is often unable to eat, drink, or go outside to urinate or defecate.  These cases must receive supportive therapy of [[intravenous fluid]]s and nutrition; a light [[sedative]] is sometimes administered, as the dog may be very stressed by the experience.

===Heart disease===
Older, small breeds of dogs are prone to [[congestive heart failure]] due to degeneration of the [[mitral valve]]. This condition is known to be inherited in [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]]s.  Degenerative valve disease is the most common form of heart disease in dogs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Degenerative Valve Disease | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/11213.htm | access-date = 2007-09-04 }}</ref> [[Mitral regurgitation]] leads to turbulent blood flow and increased pressure in the [[left atrium]]. This causes increased pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and [[pulmonary edema]] (a build-up of fluid in the lungs).  Decreased output of blood by the [[left ventricle]] causes the body to compensate by increasing [[sympathetic tone]] and activating the [[renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system]] (RAAS).  Increased sympathetic tone leads to increased [[peripheral vascular resistance]] and increased heart rate and [[contractility]] of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]].  Chronic elevation of sympathetic tone damages the heart muscle.  Activation of the RAAS results in increased retention of water and sodium by the kidneys, [[vasoconstriction|blood vessel constriction]], and other effects that result in increased blood volume.  It also results in an increase in [[diastolic pressure]] and leads to pulmonary edema. Treatment for congestive heart failure has historically focussed on two types of drugs that address these concerns: [[diuretic]]s (especially [[furosemide]]), which decrease blood volume, and [[ACE inhibitor]]s, which interrupt the RAAS. Recently, [[pimobendan]] – which increases the force with which the heart muscle contracts, and is also a vasodilator – is being more widely used in the treatment of [[congestive heart failure]] caused by valvular disease. A major veterinary study, called the QUEST study (QUality of life and Extension of Survival Time), published in September 2008 found that dogs with congestive heart failure receiving pimobendan plus furosemide had significantly better survival outcomes than those receiving [[benazepril]] (an ACE inhibitor) plus furosemide.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Häggström J, Boswood A, O'Grady M |title=Effect of pimobendan or benazepril hydrochloride on survival times in dogs with congestive heart failure caused by naturally occurring myxomatous mitral valve disease: the QUEST study |journal=J.

Within the past decade, a new surgical technique has been developed for mitral valve repair that replaces or strengthens the mitral valve chords with [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE) prostheses and tightens the mitral valve ring to reduce or eliminate regurgitation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Uechi|first1=Masami|last2=Mizukoshi|first2=Takahiro|last3=Mizuno|first3=Takeshi|last4=Mizuno|first4=Masashi|last5=Harada|first5=Kayoko|last6=Ebisawa|first6=Takashi|last7=Takeuchi|first7=Junichirou|last8=Sawada|first8=Tamotsu|last9=Uchida|first9=Shuhei|date=2012-05-04|title=Mitral valve repair under cardiopulmonary bypass in small-breed dogs: 48 cases (2006–2009)|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=240|issue=10|pages=1194–1201|doi=10.2460/javma.240.10.1194|pmid=22559109|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mightyheartsproject.org/intervention/|title=Intervention|website=Mighty Hearts Project|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jasmine-vet.co.jp/English.html|title=JASMINE Veterinary Cardiovascular Medical Center|website=Japan Animal Specialty Medical Institute|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rvc.ac.uk/small-animal-referrals/advanced-techniques-and-specialist-procedures/cardiothoracic-surgery|title=Royal Veterinary College (RVC) – Cardiothoracic Surgery|website=rvc.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>

[[Cardiomyopathy]], or disease of the heart muscle, is also seen in dogs and is associated with large breeds (the exception being [[Cocker Spaniel]]s, a medium-sized breed). [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] is seen in Great Danes, [[Irish Wolfhound]]s, St. Bernards, [[Dobermann]]s, [[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]], and other large breeds.  Dobermanns, in addition to heart muscle failure, are prone to [[Cardiac arrhythmia|ventricular arrhythmias]].  Boxer dogs are predisposed to a unique cardiomyopathy with clinical and histological changes analogous to human arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).<ref name=Basso04>{{cite journal |vauthors=Basso C, Fox PR, Meurs KM |title=Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy causing sudden cardiac death in boxer dogs: a new animal model of human disease |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=1180–5 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14993138 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000118494.07530.65 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14993138|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref> The disease has been termed "[[Boxer cardiomyopathy]]" or "Boxer ARVC", and is characterized by development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.<ref name=Meurs04>{{cite journal |author=Meurs KM |title=Boxer dog cardiomyopathy: an update |journal=Vet.

In 2018, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] issued a [https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-investigating-potential-connection-between-diet-and-cases-canine-heart-disease report] citing a possible link between certain diets and canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dog breeds without the genetic predisposition. Researchers at [[UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine|University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine]] announced the results of their own [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209112 study] in early 2019, confirming the connection and identifying a particular concentration found among [[Golden Retriever]]s. Diet-related DCM is associated with grain-free and/or legume-rich diets, as well as "boutique" dog foods containing [https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/pdf/10.2460/javma.253.11.1390 exotic ingredients] (such as bison or kangaroo meat). In the treatment of dietary DCM, food change and taurine supplementation is typically indicated, in addition to traditional medical treatments as needed.

===Other diseases and psychological issues===
Other diseases affecting dogs include [[endocrine system|endocrine]] diseases, [[immune-mediated disease]]s, and reproductive diseases. [[Diabetes in dogs|Diabetes mellitus]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[Addison's disease]], and [[hypothyroidism]] are the most common endocrine diseases. [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia|Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]] is a devastating disease that causes severe [[anemia]] in dogs through red blood cell destruction by the immune system.  It has been associated with vaccinations and certain drugs, although many cases are [[idiopathic]].  A similar but less severe immune disease is [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|immune-mediated thrombocytopenia]], characterized by destruction of [[platelet]]s by the immune system.  Clinical signs include bruising and [[petechia]]e (pinpoint bruising, often seen in the mouth).  Common reproductive diseases include [[pyometra]] (distension of the [[uterus]] with pus), [[mammary tumor]]s, and [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]].

Psychological anxieties affecting dogs include [[Noise phobia in dogs|noise phobia]] and [[Separation anxiety in dogs|separation anxiety]].

==Toxic substances==
Some common sources of toxins that pets encounter include some plants,<ref>{{cite news|title=Poisonous Plants|newspaper=Aspca|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants|publisher=[[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA)|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|year=2017}}</ref> human medications and cosmetics,<ref name="ASPCA household"/> cleaning products,<ref name="ASPCA household">{{cite web|title=Poisonous household products|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/poisonous-household-products|website=American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|year=2017}}</ref> and even some foods.<ref>{{cite web|title=People foods to avoid feeding your pets|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/people-foods-avoid-feeding-your-pets|website=American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|year=2017}}</ref>

===Dangerous foods===
Some foods consumed safely by humans are harmful to dogs:

====Chocolate====
Cocoa within chocolate contains [[theobromine]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspcapetinsurance.org.au/pet-care/pet-ownership/food-basics-for-new-puppies|title=Food basics for new puppies}}</ref> a chemical stimulant that, together with [[caffeine]] and [[theophylline]], belongs to the group of [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Dogs are unable to [[metabolize]] theobromine effectively. If they eat chocolate, the theobromine can remain in their bloodstreams for days, and dogs may experience [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], severe [[diarrhea]], [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finlay|first=Fiona|title=Chocolate poisoning|journal=BMJ|pmc=1215566|page=633|volume=331|issue=7517|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7517.633|year=2005}}</ref> One ounce (oz) of milk chocolate contains 44 - 55 milligrams (mg) of theobromine, and baker's chocolate contains 393&nbsp;mg of theobromine.<ref name=":0">Gfeller, R. & Messonnier, S. Handbook of Small Animal Toxicology and Poisonings. 2nd ed. Mosby.</ref> The lethal dose for 50% of dogs ([[LD50]]) is 100 – 200&nbsp;mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight, yet some dogs will exhibit signs of toxicosis after ingesting as little as 20&nbsp;mg per kg.<ref name=":0" /> In case of accidental intake of chocolate, especially involving a smaller dog, contact a [[veterinarian]] or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. Treatment protocol also includes intravenous fluid therapy and/or administration of activated charcoal.<ref name=":0" /> Large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning, but can still die after eating four ounces<ref>. Certain preparation methods of chocolate with other food items may increase the resultant theobromine levels. Such common prepared items include chocolate-coated accessory-fruits such as strawberries and combinations including caster sugars such as chocolate cookies.

====Grapes and raisins====
{{main|Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs}}
Grapes and raisins can cause acute [[renal failure|kidney failure]] in dogs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/food_hazards/raisins_or_grapes.html#v3348503|title=Raisins or Grapes|work=Merck Veterinary Manual |access-date=February 17, 2014}}</ref> The exact mechanism is unknown, nor is there any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual dog. While as little as one raisin can be toxic to a susceptible {{convert|10|lb|kg}} dog, some other dogs have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects. The affected dog usually vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of kidney failure three to five days later.  A [[mycotoxin]] is suspected to be involved, but one has not been found in grapes or raisins ingested by affected dogs. [[Salicylate]], [[tartaric acid]], or [[potassium bitartrate]] have also been implicated. The reason some dogs develop kidney failure following ingestion of grapes and raisins is not known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vcahospitals.com/main/pet-health-information/article/animal-health/grape-and-raisin-toxicity-in-dogs/4397|title=Grape and Raisin Toxicity in Dogs {{!}} VCA Animal Hospitals|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = McKnight | first = Katrina | title = Grape and Raisin Toxicity in Dogs | journal = Vet.

Occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem, but continuous exposure to even small amounts can be a serious threat.<ref name=":0" />

Plants in the genus ''[[Allium]]'' (onions, scallions, garlic, leek, chives, etc.) in general contain varying levels of organosulfoxides compounds including the two mentioned above. These chemicals are responsible for their signature spicyness, but also causes oxidative damage to red blood cells of dogs and cats. Poisoning have been reported from many such plants, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea and vomiting to pale gums and [[hemolysis]].<ref name="pmid27047944">{{cite journal |last1=Cortinovis |first1=C |last2=Caloni |first2=F |title=Household Food Items Toxic to Dogs and Cats. |journal=Frontiers in Veterinary Science |date=2016 |volume=3 |pages=26 |doi=10.3389/fvets.2016.00026 |pmid=27047944 |pmc=4801869|doi-access=free }}</ref>

====Nutmeg====
[[Nutmeg]] is highly [[neurotoxic]] to dogs and causes seizures, tremors, and nervous system disorders which can be fatal.  Nutmeg's rich, spicy scent is attractive to dogs which can result in a dog ingesting a lethal amount of this spice. [[Eggnog]] and other food preparations which contain nutmeg should not be given to dogs.<ref>[http://www.petinsurance.com/healthzone/pet-articles/pet-health-toxins/Toxic-Food-Guide-for-Pets.aspx], Toxic Food Guide for Pets</ref><ref>[http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/pet-safety-tips/nutmeg-cinnamon-toxicity/], Nutmeg and Cinnamon Toxicity in Dogs</ref><ref>[http://canigivemydog.com/nutmeg], Can I Give My Dog Nutmeg</ref>

====Macadamia nuts====

Most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is removed.

====Hops====
[[Hops]], a plant used in making beer, can cause [[malignant hyperthermia]] in dogs, usually with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as [[Greyhound]]s, seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity, but hops should be kept away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction, even if the hops are "spent" after use in brewing.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Duncan| first1 = KL| last2 = Hare| first2 = WR| last3 = Buck| first3 = WB| title = Malignant hyperthermia-like reaction secondary to ingestion of hops in five dogs| journal = J.

====Yeast====
Ingestion of [[yeast]], for example in uncooked bread dough, can cause intestinal obstruction. The yeast can also cause fermentation internally, resulting in ethanol (alcohol) poisoning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/toxicology/a/YeastDoughToxicity.htm|title=Foods Toxic to Pets- Yeast Bread Dough|author=Janet Tobiassen Crosby, DVM|access-date=9 August 2012|archive-date=16 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716033600/http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/toxicology/a/YeastDoughToxicity.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref><!-- Redirects to "cat always hungry"?!-->

==== Avocado ====
[[Avocado]] leaves, bark, skin, and pit are known to be harmful to a wide range of animals, including dogs and cats. Death can occur from a sufficiently high dose.  The flesh of the fruit is not generally considered toxic to the two animals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=238&p_type=all&p_sci=comm&p_x=px|title = Notes on poisoning: avocado|publisher = Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility|access-date = 29 December 2007|date = 30 June 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080114023756/http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=238&p_type=all&p_sci=comm&p_x=px| archive-date= 14 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Common household substances===
Some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs:
; [[Antifreeze]] ([[ethylene glycol]])
: {{details|Ethylene glycol poisoning}}Toxic in humans, dogs, and cats alike. Extremely dangerous to dogs (and children) due to its sweet taste. The antifreeze itself is not toxic, but is metabolized via the liver to the [[toxin]]s [[glycolate]] and [[oxalate]], which cause intoxication and vomiting, [[metabolic acidosis]], and finally [[acute kidney failure]] leading to seizures and death. By the time clinical signs are observed, the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive, so acting quickly is important. Immediate treatments include inducing vomiting by using [[apomorphine]] or dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution (if this can be done shortly after ingestion), but these merely reduce the amount absorbed – immediate veterinary treatment is still usually imperative due to the high toxicity of the compound. Medical treatments may include [[fomepizole]] (preferred treatment) which competes favorably with the toxin in the body, [[ethanol]] which competes favorably in the liver long enough to allow excretion to take place, [[activated charcoal]] to further reduce uptake of undigested product, and [[hemodialysis]] to remove toxins from the blood. Dogs should not be allowed access to any place in which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out.  Some brands of antifreeze contain [[propylene glycol]] instead of [[ethylene glycol]] for lower toxicity. Others are marketed as being less attractive to animals.
; Alcohols
: Isopropanol, methanol (common in household products), and ethanol (common in alcoholic beverages and rotten fruits) are all toxic to dogs. Isopropanol found in rubbing alcohol has twice the toxicity of ethanol; however, methanol found in windshield washer fluid does not have the same retinal and neuronal toxicity on dogs as it does to humans and primates due to the differences in the way its metabolite formic acid is processed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/211501.htm&word=ethanol%2cpoisoning|title=Merck Veterinary Manual- Alcohols| access-date = 9 August 2012}}</ref>
: The effect of ethanol on dogs and cats is similar to its effect on humans, also causing intoxication. Death is unlikely given supportive care (only one death is known). Ethanol is also an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning.<ref name="pmid27047944"/>
; [[Rat poison|Mouse and rat poison]], anticoagulant type
: Rodenticide is commonly found in the house or garage. This anticoagulant class of poison works by depleting stores of [[Vitamin K]] in the body; without these stores, blood cannot clot properly. Clinical signs of poisoning include depression, weakness, difficulty breathing, bruising, and bleeding from any part of the body.  These clinical signs often take 3 to 4 days to appear.  A blood test will confirm that the blood is not clotting properly.  If the poison has only recently been ingested (within 2 to 3 hours), the dog should be given [[apomorphine]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] to induce vomiting. [[Activated carbon|Activated charcoal]] can be given to absorb any remaining poison in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  Then the dog is given Vitamin K supplementation for 3 to 4 weeks, depending on the type of poison.  At the end of treatment, the [[coagulation|clotting times]] should be tested again.  The [[prognosis]] is good in these cases.  However, if the dog is already showing signs of poisoning, it is too late to try to remove the poison from the body.  A whole [[blood transfusion]] or [[blood plasma|plasma]] is given to treat the [[anemia]] and to try to control bleeding.  Vitamin K is also given.  The prognosis is poor in these cases.
; Mouse and rat poison, hypercalcemia type
: Mouse and rat poisons containing [[cholecalciferol]] cause [[hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]] and [[hyperphosphatemia]] in dogs.  Clinical signs include depression, loss of appetite, vomiting blood, weakness, and shock.  Treatment is as above for recent exposure.  When hypercalcemia occurs (which can take 1 to 2 weeks), treatment is with [[intravenous fluid]]s (saline), [[diuretic]]s, [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[calcitonin]].  Long term prognosis is good once the dog is stabilized.
; [[Molluscicide|Snail bait]], metaldehyde type
: Ingestion can cause anxiety, muscle twitching, seizures, rapid heart rate, dilated pupils, hypersalivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever due to the [[metaldehyde]] present. Treatment involves gastric [[lavage]], intravenous fluid administration, and/or administration of activated charcoal.<ref name=":0" />

===Over-the-counter medications===
Poisoning with pain medications is common. [[Aspirin]], [[paracetamol]]/acetaminophen (Tylenol), [[ibuprofen]] (Advil), and [[naproxen]] (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Villar|first1=D|last2=Buck|first2=WB|last3=Gonzalez|first3=JM|title=Ibuprofen, aspirin and acetaminophen toxicosis and treatment in dogs and cats|journal=Vet.

The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity is [[N-acetylcysteine]].<ref name=":0" />

== Public health risks ==
[[Image:Canine scabies mite.JPG|thumb|''Sarcoptes scabiei'']]
Most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species.  Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are termed [[zoonosis|zoonoses]].  A well-known zoonosis is rabies, a viral infection transmitted through a bite.  A common bacterial zoonosis is [[leptospirosis]], transmitted through urine.  Some of the most important zoonoses are parasitic.  Zoonotic [[intestinal parasite]]s transmitted through contact with feces include ''[[Toxocara canis]]'' (the canine roundworm), which causes [[toxocariasis]], [[visceral larva migrans]], and [[ocular larva migrans]], and [[hookworm]]s, which can cause [[cutaneous larva migrans]].  Zoonotic skin parasites include [[scabies]], caused by the mite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''.  The most common zoonotic fungal disease is [[ringworm]], caused in this case by ''[[Microsporum canis]]''.

==Preventive medicine==
===Vaccinations===
{{main|Vaccination of dogs}}
Vaccinations are an important preventive animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, ''canine parvovirus'', canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using ''canine adenovirus type 2'' to avoid reaction).  The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, ''Bordetella bronchiseptica'', ''[[parainfluenza virus]]'', and ''[[canine coronavirus]]'', should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog.

===Dentistry===
{{Main|Veterinary dentistry}}
[[Dental disease]] is one of the most common diseases in dogs.  Accumulation of [[dental plaque|plaque]], and subsequently [[calculus (dental)|tartar]], leads to [[gingivitis]], and then [[periodontitis]] (gum disease).  Periodontitis leads to loss of the bony attachment of the teeth, and tooth loss.  Preventive measures include [[tooth brushing]], providing an appropriate diet (avoiding tinned and other soft foods, and providing dental chew treats), and [[Tooth scaling|dental scaling]] and polishing. [[Dental caries (non-human)|Cavities]] are uncommon in dogs.

===Heartworm, flea or tick preventives===
{{see also|Heartworm|Flea treatments}}
Once-a-month topical products and oral medications are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent heartworm infection and flea or tick infestations.

==Nutrition and obesity==
{{see also | Obesity in pets }}
[[Image:Bichon ice cream.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Human food such as ice cream can lead to ill health and obesity in dogs.]]
Feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended, at least in excess. Just as in humans, a dog's diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients, carbohydrates, and proteins to give them the minerals and vitamins that they need. Dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural, normal diet; wild and [[feral]] dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat. In addition, a human diet is not ideal for a dog: the concept of a "balanced" diet for a [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] [[carnivore]] like a dog is not the same as in an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] human. Dogs will usually eat all the scraps and treats they are fed: usually too much food. While not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs (see above), many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans. [[Image:Lightblueheeler.jpg|thumb|This [[Australian Cattle Dog]]'s obesity poses a health risk for the dog.]]

[[Obesity]] is an increasingly common problem in dogs in Western countries. As with humans, obesity can cause numerous health problems in dogs (although dogs are much less susceptible to the common [[cardiac]] and [[arterial]] consequences of obesity than humans are). According to a study published in the ''Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine'', the prevalence of obesity in dogs is between 22 and 40 percent.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/537932/ Humans Not the Only Creatures Suffering from Obesity] Newswise. Retrieved November 3, 2008.</ref>

Obesity may also be caused by some diseases, such as [[Cushing's syndrome (veterinary)|Cushing's disease]] or [[hypothyroidism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Mark S.|title=Small animal medical differential diagnosis: a book of lists|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9781455744541|page=54|edition=2nd|chapter=Obesity}}</ref>

===Dog treats===
Dog treats are often given to pets as a reward or just to let them chew on a bone, which works their jaw muscles and helps keep their teeth clean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogsvitamins.net/treats.html|title=Dog Treats with Dog Vitamins|access-date=2010-05-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523065736/http://www.dogsvitamins.net/treats.html|archive-date=2010-05-23}}</ref> Although dog treats carry high benefits for dogs' teeth, they can also be a source of problems like obesity when given excessively, especially human table scraps.

The type of food given directly affects the tendency of a dog to become overweight. Table scraps, treats, and even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1660&aid=688|title=Diseases & Conditions Contributing to Dog Obesity|access-date=2010-05-20}}</ref> Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats are more likely to be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age they are less likely to be active and exercising. Active dogs require and use more [[calories]]. 
===Coprophagia===
{{main|coprophagia}}
Some dogs may attempt to consume feces. Some consume their own or other dogs' feces; others seem to prefer cat feces (which, due to the feline digestive system,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/coprophagia-eating-feces|title=Coprophagia (Eating Feces)| access-date = 14 December 2013}}</ref> are high in protein and consumed by many animals in the wild.) This can be harmful if the feces has any pathogens or parasites or contain excreted drugs.

==Vitamins and supplements==
It is not yet clear whether or not [[vitamins]] and [[Dietary supplement|supplements]] should be administered in dogs—opinions among veterinarians vary widely. While some think that vitamins and supplements are necessary and can improve the health of a dog, others believe that they are unnecessary and may harm the dog. According to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), dogs receive a complete and balanced diet from the commercially processed dog food alone. Pet owners who give their dogs homemade diets may incorporate extra vitamins and supplements.

Between approximately 10 and 30 percent of dogs in the United States receive nutritional supplements.<ref name="Eirmann 2017">{{cite book|last1=Eirmann|first1=L|editor1-last=Ettinger|editor1-first=SJ|editor2-last=Feldman|editor2-first=EC|editor3-last=Cote|editor3-first=E|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323312394|edition=8th|chapter=Chapter 167: Antioxidants, nutraceuticals, probiotics, and nutritional supplements}}</ref> A survey of U.S. pet owners in 2006 found that the most commonly used supplements were multivitamins and [[Chondroprotection|chondroprotective]] agents.<ref name="Freeman 2006">{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=LM|last2=Abood|first2=SK|last3=Fascetti|first3=AJ|last4=Fleeman|first4=LM|last5=Michel|first5=KE|last6=Laflamme|first6=DP|last7=Bauer|first7=C|last8=Kemp|first8=BL|last9=Van Doren|first9=JR|last10=Willoughby|first10=KN|s2cid=24243005|title=Disease prevalence among dogs and cats in the United States and Australia and proportions of dogs and cats that receive therapeutic diets or dietary supplements|journal=J.

Overdoses of vitamins can be harmful in dogs. As an example, [[calcium]] in excess can cause bone problems, especially in the large-breed dogs. Over-supplementation of vitamins A and D can cause vitamin toxicity in dogs.<ref>[http://www.allsmalldogs.org/uncategorized/the-best-dog-food-for-small-dogs/ Food for Small Dogs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222119/http://www.allsmalldogs.org/uncategorized/the-best-dog-food-for-small-dogs/ |date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> Excess [[vitamin A]] can cause [[dehydration]], [[joint pain]] and can also harm the [[blood vessels]], while too much [[vitamin D]] can cause [[muscular atrophy]], loss of appetite and many other [https://www.thepetgazette.com/winter-2019/know-vitamin-d-deficiency-associated-variety-health-problems-dogs-cats/ health-related problems].

==Reproductive health==
{{main|Canine reproduction}}

===Spaying and neutering===
{{main|Neutering}}
Spaying (females) and neutering (males) refers to the [[Neutering|sterilization]] of animals, usually by removal of the male's [[testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Neutering has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs, but has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Heidenberger E, Unshelm J |title=[Changes in the behavior of dogs after castration] |language=de |journal=Tierarztl. Prax. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=69–75 |year=1990 |pmid=2326799 }}</ref>

Animal control agencies in the United States and the [[ASPCA]] advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/top-10-reasons-spay-or-neuter-your-pet
|title=Top 10 Reasons to Spay or Neuter Your Pet
|publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
|access-date=27 January 2015}}</ref>

Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, puppies born to strays or as the result of accidental breedings often end up being killed in animal shelters. Spaying and neutering can also decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors.  However, certain medical problems are more likely after surgery, such as [[urinary incontinence]] in females<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arnold S |title=[Urinary incontinence in castrated bitches. Part 1: Significance, clinical aspects and etiopathogenesis] |language=de |journal=Schweiz. Arch. Tierheilkd. |volume=139 |issue=6 |pages=271–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9411733 }}</ref> and [[prostate cancer]] in males.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnston SD, Kamolpatana K, Root-Kustritz MV, Johnston GR |title=Prostatic disorders in the dog |journal=[[Anim. Reprod. Sci.]] |volume=60-61 |pages=405–15 |year=2000 |pmid=10844211 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4320(00)00101-9}}</ref> The hormonal changes involved with sterilization are likely to somewhat change the animal's personality, however, and some object to spaying and neutering as the sterilization could be carried out without the excision of organs.

It is not essential for a female dog to either experience a [[Estrous cycle|heat cycle]] or have puppies before spaying, and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of [[canine reproduction|mating]] before neutering.

Female cats and dogs are seven times more likely to develop [[mammary tumor]]s if they are not spayed before their first [[estrus cycle|heat cycle]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats (1st ed.)|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=978-0-683-06105-5}}</ref> The high dietary estrogen content of the average commercial pet food may be contributing factors in the development of mammary cancer, especially when these exogenous sources are added to those normal estrogens produced by the body. Dog food containing soybeans or soybean fractions have been found to contain [[phytoestrogens]] in levels that could have biological effects when ingested longterm.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cerundolo R, Court MH, Hao Q, Michel KE |title=Identification and concentration of soy phytoestrogens in commercial dog foods |journal=Am. J. Vet. Res. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=592–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15141878 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.2004.65.592|doi-access=free }}</ref>
