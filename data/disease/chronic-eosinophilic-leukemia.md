'''Chronic eosinophilic leukemia'''  is a form of cancer in which too many [[eosinophils]] are found in the [[bone marrow]], [[blood]], and other tissues. Most cases are associated with [[fusion genes]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/chronic-eosinophilic-leukemia/| title=Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia
|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 8 July 2021}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms may include weight loss, fever, [[malaise]], cough, skin and mucosal lesions, diarrhea, and [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Cardiac symptoms are also possible.<ref name=jaffe>{{cite book |last1=Jaffe |first1=Elaine |title=Hematopathology |isbn=978-0-323-29613-7 |pages=931–941 |edition=2|date=2016-08-25 }}</ref> 

In cases associated with PDGFRB and FGFR1 mutations, [[splenomegaly]] is common. [[Lymphadenopathy]] is also common with FGFR1 mutations.<ref name=jaffe/>

Infiltration of eosinophils causes organ damage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McPherson |title=Henry's Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods |year=2011 |url=https://archive.org/details/henrysclinicaldi00mdri_935 |url-access=limited |publisher=Elsevier |pages=[https://archive.org/details/henrysclinicaldi00mdri_935/page/n612 606]–658 |isbn=9781437709742 |edition=23}}</ref>

==Causes==
Most cases of CEL are associated with [[gene rearrangement|rearrangements]] in [[PDGFRA]], [[PDGFRB]], or [[FGFR1]].<ref name="hoffman">{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Ronald |title=Hematology: basic principles and practice |isbn=978-0-323-35762-3 |pages=1151–1169 |edition=Seven|date=2017-08-15 }}</ref>

CEL not otherwise specified (CEL NOS) is a form in which BCR-ABL1 fusion genes and PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1 rearrangements are not found.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aster |first1=Jon |title=Hematopathology: A Volume in the High Yield Pathology Series |date = 19 June 2013 |publisher=Elsevier |page=222}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
For a diagnosis of CEL, [[hypereosinophilia]] with greater than 30% eosinophils is required.<ref name=hoffman/> Serum [[IgE]] is usually normal.
In cases associated with PDGFRB, serum vitamin B12 and [[tryptase]] may be elevated.<ref name=jaffe/>

== Prognosis==
CEL associated with a mutation in [[PDGFRA]] is treatable with [[imatinib]] and has an excellent prognosis. On the other hand, CEL associated with [[FGFR1]] mutations has a very poor prognosis.<ref name=hoffman/>
Progression can occur from CEL to [[Acute eosinophilic leukemia|AEL]] or [[Acute myeloid leukemia|AML]] in rare cases.<ref name=hoffman/>

== Epidemiology ==
Cases occur in people of all ages. The disease is more common in males than females.<ref name=jaffe/>
