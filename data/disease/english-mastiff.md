The '''English Mastiff''', or simply the '''Mastiff''', is a British [[dog breed]] of very large size. It is likely descended from the ancient [[Alaunt]] and [[Pugnaces Britanniae]], with a significant input from the [[Alpine Mastiff]] in the 19th century. Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black [[mask]], the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as [[Mastiff|mastiff-type dog]]s or, confusingly, just as "mastiffs". It is the largest living [[Caninae|canine]], outweighing the [[wolf]] by up to 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lbs) on average.

==Appearance==
[[File:EnglishMastiffChurchill.JPG|thumb|Fawn English Mastiff]]
With a massive body, broad skull and head of generally [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|square]] appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the [[Irish Wolfhound]] and [[Great Dane]] can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as robust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |title=The Biggest Dog Breed |publisher=Bigpawsonly.com |access-date=19 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725033914/http://www.bigpawsonly.com/biggest-dog-features.htm |archive-date=25 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs—which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is {{convert|30|in|cm}} at the shoulder for males and {{convert|27.5|in|cm}} (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh {{convert|150|-|250|lb|kg}}, a typical female can weigh {{convert|120|-|200|lb|kg}}, with very large individuals reaching {{convert|300|lb|kg}} or more.

===Coat colour standards===
The former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long-haired Mastiffs, known as "Fluffies", are caused by a recessive gene — they are occasionally seen. The AKC considers a long coat a fault but not cause for disqualification. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-[[brindle]], always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. [[Image:Mastif angielski pregowany 768.jpg|thumb|left|The Mastiff has a distinctive head with [[dewlap]] and [[Snout|flews]]. The black mask is visible even on this brindle.]]

The colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black [[brindle]]. A [[Melanistic mask|black mask]] should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light "silver" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. [[Piebald]] Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour, other than black, which may no longer exist as a Mastiff colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.<ref>Clarence C. Little, ''The Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs'', Howell Book House, 1957</ref>
[[File:Mastiff1.jpg|thumb|Two Mastiffs: one apricot, one fawn]]

[[Coat (dog)#Genetic basis of color and pattern|The genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs]] has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/dogcolors.html |title=Dog Coat Color Genetics |publisher=Homepage.usask.ca |access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref> On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are [[Ploidy|diploid]] animals, each gene location ([[locus (genetics)|locus]]) appears twice in every animal, so questions of [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]] also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are A<sup>y</sup>BDE<sup>m</sup>h(k<sup>br</sup>_or_k<sup>y</sup>)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-[[merle (dog coat)|merle]], and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include "b" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), "d" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), "s<sup>p</sup>" (pied spotting), and perhaps "a" (recessive black). The possible combination of [[homozygous]] brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as [[Liver (color)#Liver in dogs|Isabella]] in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be "I" (apricot) or "i" (non-apricot) and perhaps "c<sup>ch</sup>" (silver lightening) or "C" (without silver lightening).<ref>Sheila M. Schmutz (27 December 2008). "Coat Color Alleles in Dogs". Retrieved 12 September 2010</ref> (Note that this "C locus" may not be the same as the one identified in other animals, [[SLC45A2]].)

===Record size===
The greatest weight ever recorded for a dog, {{convert|343|lb|kg|1}}, was that of an English Mastiff
from England named Aicama [[Zorba (dog)|Zorba]] of La Susa, although claims of larger dogs, including [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernards]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]]s, and [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog|Caucasian ovcharkas]] exist.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2000'' – Millennium edition, Pg 106, Guinness World Records Ltd., 2000, {{ISBN|0-85112-098-9}}</ref> According to the 1989 edition of the [[Guinness Book of Records]], in March 1989, when he was 7 years old, Zorba stood {{convert|37|in|cm}} at the shoulder and was 8&nbsp;ft 3 in (251&nbsp;cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, about the size of a small [[donkey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/other/donkey/mini/index.htm |title=Breeds of Livestock – Miniature Donkey |publisher=Ansi.okstate.edu |access-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031104054/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/other/donkey/mini/index.htm |archive-date=31 October 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> After 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records stopped accepting largest or heaviest pet records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/set-a-record/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Guinness World Records |access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref>

==Temperament==
The Mastiff breed has a desired temperament, which is reflected in all formal standards and historical descriptions. [[Sydenham Edwards]] wrote in 1800 in the ''Cynographia Britannica'':
<blockquote>What the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the kindest of his race. His docility is perfect; the teazing of the smaller kinds will hardly provoke him to resent, and I have seen him down with his paw the Terrier or cur that has bit him, without offering further injury. In a family he will permit the children to play with him, and suffer all their little pranks without offence. The blind ferocity of the Bull Dog will often wound the hand of the master who assists him to combat, but the Mastiff distinguishes perfectly, enters the field with temper, and engages in the attack as if confident of success: if he overpowers, or is beaten, his master may take him immediately in his arms and fear nothing. This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the [[leopard|pard]], and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the [[deserts]] of [[Zaara]] or the [[plain]]s of [[Numidia]].<ref>[[Sydenham Edwards]]''Cynographia Britannica'', 1800 London: C. Whittingham</ref></blockquote>

The [[American Kennel Club]] sums up the Mastiff breed as:
:a combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Kennel Club – Mastiff|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/mastiff/|publisher=The American Kennel Club|access-date=23 June 2012}}</ref>

==Health==
[[File:Mastiff pup 4 weeks.jpg|thumb|left|Even at four weeks, a Mastiff should seem massive]]

At all stages of development, the Mastiff should show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement.
The Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first 2 years of the dog's life, in order not to damage the [[growth plate]]s in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5&nbsp;lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog's life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed's large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing.  A [[whelping box]], along with careful monitoring, can prevent such accidents.

A UK study found a life expectancy of 9 years for the breed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=K. M.|last2=Bielby|first2=J.|last3=Williams|first3=C.L.|title=Longevity of companion dog breeds: those at risk from early death|journal=Scientific Reports|year=2024|volume=14|page=531|doi=10.1038/s41598-023-50458-w|pmc=10834484}}Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 3</ref>

Major problems can include [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] and [[gastric torsion]]. Other problems include [[obesity]], [[osteosarcoma]], and [[cystinuria]]. Problems only occasionally found include [[cardiomyopathy]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[vaginal]] [[hyperplasia]], [[cruciate ligament]] rupture, [[hypothyroidism]], [[Osteochondritis dissecans|OCD]], [[entropion]], [[progressive retinal atrophy]] (PRA), and [[persistent pupillary membrane]]s (PPM).

When purchasing a purebred Mastiff, experts often suggest that the dog undergo tests for [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[elbow dysplasia]], [[thyroid]], and [[DNA]] for [[Progressive retinal atrophy|PRA]].

A Mastiff may be kept in an apartment, but care must be taken to give it enough exercise. Mastiffs should be fed two or three times a day; it is believed that one large meal per day can increase the chance of [[Gastric dilatation volvulus|gastric torsion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vethelpdirect.com/vetblog/2011/03/16/gastric-torsion-in-dogs/|title=Gastric Torsion in Dogs - Vet Help Direct|date=16 March 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===From ancient times to the early 19th century===
There is a ceramic and paint sculpture of a mastiff-like dog from [[Mesopotamia]] region during the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period (mid-2nd millennium B.C.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/327389|title=Mastiff|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}} Gallery 406</ref>

These dogs may be related to the dogs that fought lions, tigers, bears, and gladiators in Roman [[arena]]s.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368782/mastiff mastiff]. ''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''. Chicago, 2012. Accessed 3 October 2013.</ref> Certainly an element in the formation of the English Mastiff was the [[Pugnaces Britanniae]] that existed at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]]. The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] poet [[Grattius]] (or Grattius Faliscus) wrote of British dogs, describing them as superior to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Molossus (dog)|Molossus]], saying:

<blockquote>What if you choose to penetrate even among the Britons? How great your reward, how great your gain beyond any outlays! If you are not bent on looks and deceptive graces (this is the one defect of the British whelps), at any rate when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the impetuous [[Mars (mythology)|War-god]] calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not admire the renowned Molossians so much.<ref name="grattius">{{Cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Grattius/Cynegeticon*.html#ref38|title=Grattius – Cynegeticon|access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

The turn-of-the-millennium Greek historian [[Strabo]] reported that dogs were exported from Britain for the purpose of [[game (food)|game]] hunting, and that these dogs were also used by the [[Celts]] as [[war dog]]s.<ref name="strabo">{{Cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html#ref143|title=Strabo's Geography|access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref> As far as the origin of the Pugnaces Britanniae is concerned, there is unproven speculation that they were descended from dogs brought to Britain by the [[Phoenicians]] in the 6th century BC.<ref>Leighton, R. (1907). ''The New Book of the Dog''. Cassell.</ref> This breed's first written accounts in England date back to 55 BC when [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] noted them during his invasions.

The [[Alaunt]] is likely to have been another genetic predecessor to the English Mastiff. Introduced by the [[Normans]], these dogs were developed by the [[Alans]], who had migrated into France (then known as [[Gaul]]) due to pressure by the [[Huns]] at the start of the 5th century. Intriguingly they were known from the Romans to live in a region (the [[Pontic-Caspian Steppe]]) about 700&nbsp;km to the north of the region where the Assyrians once lived. Again, any canine connections are speculative.<ref>Hancock, David (2001). The Mastiffs: The Big Game Hunters</ref>

The linguistic origin of the name "Mastiff" is unclear.  Many claim that it evolved from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word "masty", meaning "powerful".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mastiffclub.com/club/breed-standard.htm |title=Mastiff Breed Standard – Club – Old English Mastiff Club |publisher=Mastiffclub.com |access-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129230546/http://www.mastiffclub.com/club/breed-standard.htm |archive-date=29 January 2018 }}</ref> Other sources, such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', say the word originated from the [[Old French]] word ''mastin'' ([[Modern French]] ''mâtin''), the word being itself derived from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*ma(n)suetinus'' "tame", see [[Classical Latin]] ''mansuetus'' with same meaning. The first list of [[Dog type#Dog type names in English|dog breed names]] in the English language, contained within ''[[The Book of Saint Albans]]'', published in 1465, includes "''Mastiff ''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrysportsandcountrylife.com/sections/pedigree_dog/history_of_dog/classification.htm|title=The history of the dog in Britain}}</ref> This work is attributed to [[Prioress]] [[Juliana Berners]], but in part may be translated from the early 14th century Norman-French work ''Le Art de Venerie'', by [[Edward II]]'s [[Fox hunting#People|Huntmaster]] Guillaume Twici.<ref>{{cite book

 In 1570, [[Conrad Heresbach]], in ''Rei Rusticae Libri Quatuor'', referred to "the Mastie that keepeth the house".<ref>Andersson, D. D. (1999). ''The Mastiff: Aristocratic Guardian''. Doral Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-944875-51-3}}</ref> Heresbach was writing in Latin; his work was translated a few years later into English by [[Barnabe Googe]] as ''Foure Bookes of Husbandrie''.<ref>''Foure bookes of husbandrie, collected by M.

Certainly from [[Roman Empire|Roman]] to [[medieval]] times, Mastiff-like dogs were used in the [[blood sports]] of [[bull-baiting]], [[bear-baiting]], [[lion-baiting]], and [[dog fighting]], as well as for hunting and guarding. [[File:Bear-bating Abraham Hondius 1650.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of about 1650 by [[Abraham Hondius]] of a bear-baiting with dogs, including at least one apparent Mastiff]] Dogs known as Bandogs, who were tied (bound) close to houses, were of the Mastiff type.[[File:The Mastiff Reinagle 1894.jpg|thumb|A picture of 1804 by [[Philip Reinagle]], engraved by [[John Scott (engraver)|John Scott]], showing a Mastiff of the Bandog type]]They were described by [[John Caius]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gis.net/~shepdog/BC_Museum/Permanent/Caius/Caius.html |title=BC Museum: Caius |publisher=Gis.net |date=18 August 2010 |access-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130062728/http://www.gis.net/~shepdog/BC_Museum/Permanent/Caius/Caius.html |archive-date=30 November 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> in 1570 as vast, huge, stubborn, ugly, and eager, of a heavy and burdensome body—noted for their use as guard dogs on remote estates.

The naturalist [[Christopher Merret]] in his 1666 work  ''Pinax Rerum Naturalium Brittanicarum'' has a list of British mammals, including 15 kinds of dog, one of which is "Molossus, Canis bellicosus Anglicus, a Mastif".<ref>{{cite book | title=Butterflies | publisher=Collins (New Naturalist) | author=Ford, E.

[[File:1815 Alpine Mastiff.jpg|thumb|Alpine Mastiff (1805), contributor to the modern Mastiff along with his contemporaries of English stock]]

When in 1415 Sir [[Peers Legh]] was wounded in the [[Battle of Agincourt]], his Mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle.  The Mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the [[Lyme Hall]] Mastiffs.  Five centuries later this [[Pedigree (dog)|pedigree]] figured prominently in founding the modern breed.<ref>Homan, M. (2000). ''A Complete History of Fighting Dogs (Pg.10)'' Howell Book House Inc. {{ISBN|1-58245-128-1}}</ref> Other aristocratic seats where Mastiffs are known to have been kept are [[Elvaston Castle]] ([[Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington]] and his ancestors) and [[Chatsworth House]]. The owner of the Chatsworth Mastiffs (which were said to be of [[Alpine Mastiff]] stock) was [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], known to his family as ''Canis''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~awoodley/regency/devon.html |title=Regency Personalities – Georgiana – Duchess of Devonshire |publisher=Homepages.ihug.co.nz |access-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228120455/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/%7Eawoodley/regency/devon.html |archive-date=28 February 2018 }}</ref> Mastiffs were also kept at [[Hadzor|Hadzor Hall]], owned by members of the [[Galton (disambiguation)|Galton family]], famous for industrialists and scientists, including [[Charles Darwin]]. Some evidence exists that the Mastiff first came to [[Americas|America]] on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', but the breed's further documented entry to America did not occur until the late 19th century.

===From the early 19th century to World War I===
In 1835, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] implemented an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] called the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]], which prohibited the [[bait (dogs)|baiting]] of animals. This may have led to decline in the aggressive Mastiffs used for this purpose, but Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses.

Systematic breeding began in the 19th century,<ref name=Wynn>''The History of the Mastiff'', M. B. Wynn 1885. William Loxley.</ref> when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head [[gamekeeper]] of [[Kirklees Hall]], whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson's grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the [[Bold Hall]] line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from [[narrowboat|canal boat]] men, another caught by Crabtree in a [[Red fox|fox]] [[Animal trapping|trap]], a dog from [[Nostal priory]] and another dog from [[Walton Hall, West Yorkshire|Walton Hall]], owned by the naturalist, [[Charles Waterton]]. J. W. Thompson's first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer [[Bill George (dog dealer)|Bill George]], to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an Alpine Mastiff bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|Marquis of Hertford]]. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White's possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson's. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century.

[[File:Mastiff Pluto 1830.jpg|thumb|Marquis of Hertford's [[cropped ear|crop-eared]] black Mastiff Pluto (1830)]]

Another important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The [[Royal Engineers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The chronicles of the Garniers of Hampshire during four centuries, 1530–1900 |first=A E |last= Garnier |url= https://archive.org/details/chroniclesofgarn00garn |publisher=Jarrold and Son |date=1900  }}</ref> He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at [[Leadenhall Market]], was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at [[Tattersalls]] and suspected by Garnier of containing a "dash of Boarhound", an ancestral form of [[Great Dane]]. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a [[Scottish Deerhound]], and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and [[Irish Wolfhound]]s).[[File:Lukey's Governor (Mastiff).jpg|thumb|left|Lukey's Governor, born 1861, a six generation ancestor of Ch. Crown Prince]][[File:Crown Prince.jpg|thumb|left|The controversial Ch. Crown Prince, pictured in old age]] In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but [[Stifle joint|straight-stifled]] and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common.[[File:John Paul "Four Dogs".jpg|thumb|[[John Paul (artist)|John Paul]]'s 1867 painting showing a typical mid-19th century longer-headed apricot brindle]] Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist [[Mark Hanbury Beaufoy]], later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America.

[[File:Mastiff Champion Beaufort.jpg|thumb|right|Beaufort, acclaimed 19th century champion, grandson of Crown Prince]]

AKC recognition occurred in 1885.<ref name=":0" /> Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time [[World War I]] ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain.

===After World War I===
In 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the [[Second World War]] Those who can still be found in modern [[pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s were 12 in number,<ref>(1) Roxbury Boy, (2) Millfold Lass, (3) Buzzard Pride (survived only by Merle's Brunhilda of Lyme Hall, who was in turn survived only by Shanno of Lyme Hall), (4) Gyn of Hammercliffe, (5) Duke of Hellingly, (6) Kathleen of Hellingly, (7) King of Hellingly (survived only by Eric of Altnacraig), (8) Maude of Hellingly, (9) Crusader of Goring (survived only by Blythe of Hampden), (10) Goldhawk Elsie, (11) Broomcourt Nell, (12) Rolanda, ''The History & Management of the Mastiff'', Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004</ref> meaning the North American contribution to the [[gene pool]] after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs.

In the [[British Isles]] during World War II, virtually all Mastiff breeding stopped due to the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] of meat. After the war, such puppies as were produced mostly succumbed to [[canine distemper]], for which no vaccine was developed until 1950.<ref name=Pomeroy2008>{{cite journal  | author1 = Pomeroy, L.W. | author2 = Bjørnstad, O.N | author3 = Holmes, E.C. | year = 2008 | title = The Evolutionary and Epidemiological Dynamics of the Paramyxoviridae | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 66 | issue = #2| pages = 98–106 | doi=10.1007/s00239-007-9040-x | pmid=18217182 | pmc=3334863| bibcode = 2008JMolE..66...98P }}</ref> Only a single bitch puppy produced by the elderly stock that survived the war reached maturity, Nydia of Frithend. Her sire had to be declared a Mastiff by the Kennel Club, as his parentage was unknown, and he was thought by some to be a [[Bullmastiff]].

After the war, animals from North America (predominantly from Canada) were imported into Britain. Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant [[Giant dog breed|giant breed]]s, such as [[Bullmastiff]]s and [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]s, with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff. In 1959, a [[Dogue de Bordeaux]], Fidelle de Fenelon, was imported from France to the U.S., registered as a Mastiff, and became the 16th animal in the post-war gene pool.<ref name="B&H">''The History & Management of the Mastiff'', Author(s): Baxter, Elizabeth J; Hoffman, Patricia B., Dogwise 2004 {{ISBN|1-929242-11-5}}</ref> Since that time, the breed has gradually been restored in Great Britain, has reached the 28th most popular breed in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |access-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716173939/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archive-date=16 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> and is now found worldwide.
