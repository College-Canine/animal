== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Otitis Media.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Otitis media]]
The primary symptom of acute otitis media is [[otalgia|ear pain]]; other possible symptoms include [[fever]], reduced hearing during periods of illness, tenderness on touch of the skin above the ear, purulent discharge from the ears, [[irritability]], ear blocking sensation and diarrhea (in infants). Since an episode of otitis media is usually precipitated by an [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (URTI), there are often accompanying symptoms like a [[cough]] and [[nasal discharge]].<ref name="Peads2013"/>  One might also experience a feeling of fullness in the ear.

Discharge from the ear can be caused by acute otitis media with perforation of the eardrum, chronic suppurative otitis media, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, or acute otitis externa. Trauma, such as a [[basilar skull fracture]], can also lead to [[cerebrospinal fluid leaking|cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea]] (discharge of CSF from the ear) due to cerebral spinal drainage from the brain and its covering (meninges).{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==Causes==
The common cause of all forms of otitis media is dysfunction of the [[Eustachian tube]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Bluestone CD |title= Eustachian tube: structure, function, role in otitis media |year=2005 |location=Hamilton, London |publisher=BC Decker |pages=1–219 |isbn=978-1-55009-066-6 }}</ref> This is usually due to inflammation of the [[mucous membranes]] in the [[nasopharynx]], which can be caused by a viral [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (URTI), [[strep throat]], or possibly by [[allergy|allergies]].<ref name="John D Donaldson">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/859316-overview |title=Acute Otitis Media |first = John D | last = Donaldson |publisher=Medscape |access-date=17 March 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328051741/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/859316-overview |archive-date=28 March 2013 }}</ref>

By reflux or aspiration of unwanted secretions from the nasopharynx into the normally sterile middle-ear space, the fluid may then become infected – usually with [[bacteria]]. The virus that caused the initial upper respiratory infection can itself be identified as the [[pathogen]] causing the infection.<ref name="John D Donaldson"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Subtotal Perforation of the right tympanic membrane.tif|thumbnail|290px|Perforation of the right tympanic membrane resulting from previous severe acute otitis media]]
As its typical symptoms overlap with other conditions, such as acute external otitis, symptoms alone are not sufficient to predict whether acute otitis media is present; it has to be complemented by visualization of the [[tympanic membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laine MK, Tähtinen PA, Ruuskanen O, Huovinen P, Ruohola A | title = Symptoms or symptom-based scores cannot predict acute otitis media at otitis-prone age | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = e1154–61 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20368317 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2009-2689 | s2cid = 709374 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaikh N, Hoberman A, Kaleida PH, Ploof DL, Paradise JL | title = Videos in clinical medicine.

Acute otitis media in children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new onset of otorrhea (drainage) is not due to external otitis. Also, the diagnosis may be made in children who have mild bulging of the ear drum and recent onset of ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema (redness) of the ear drum.

To confirm the diagnosis, middle-ear effusion and inflammation of the eardrum (called {{vanchor|myringitis}} or tympanitis) have to be identified; signs of these are fullness, bulging, cloudiness and redness of the eardrum.<ref name="Peads2013"/> It is important to attempt to differentiate between acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME), as antibiotics are not recommended for OME.<ref name="Peads2013"/> It has been suggested that bulging of the tympanic membrane is the best sign to differentiate AOM from OME, with a bulging of the membrane suggesting AOM rather than OME.<ref name="Acad Pediatr 2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaikh N, Hoberman A, Rockette HE, Kurs-Lasky M | title = Development of an algorithm for the diagnosis of otitis media | journal = Academic Pediatrics | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–218 | date = March 28, 2012 | pmid = 22459064 | doi = 10.1016/j.acap.2012.01.007 | url = http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/14061/1/22459064.full.pdf | type = Submitted manuscript | access-date = November 3, 2018 | archive-date = October 26, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201026011859/http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/14061/1/22459064.full.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>

Viral otitis may result in blisters on the external side of the tympanic membrane, which is called ''[[bullous myringitis]]'' (''myringa'' being Latin for "eardrum").<ref name="bm">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts DB | title = The etiology of bullous myringitis and the role of mycoplasmas in ear disease: a review | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 761–766 | date = April 1980 | doi = 10.1542/peds.65.4.761 | pmid = 7367083 | s2cid = 31536385 }}</ref>

However, sometimes even examination of the eardrum may not be able to confirm the diagnosis, especially if the canal is small. If wax in the ear canal obscures a clear view of the eardrum it should be removed using a blunt cerumen curette or a wire loop. Also, an upset young child's crying can cause the eardrum to look inflamed due to distension of the small blood vessels on it, mimicking the redness associated with otitis media.

===Acute otitis media===
The most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear in AOM are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]],''<ref name="Peads2013"/> and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benninger MS | title = Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and otitis media: changes in pathogenicity following widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine | journal =   Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 138 | issue = 3 | pages = 274–278 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18312870 | doi = 10.1016/j.otohns.2007.11.011 | s2cid = 207300175 }}</ref>

Early-onset OME is associated with feeding of infants while lying down, early entry into group [[child care]], parental [[smoking]], lack or too short a period of [[breastfeeding]], and greater amounts of time spent in group child care, particularly those with a large number of children. These risk factors increase the incidence and duration of OME during the first two years of life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Owen MJ, Baldwin CD, Swank PR, Pannu AK, Johnson DL, Howie VM | title = Relation of infant feeding practices, cigarette smoke exposure, and group child care to the onset and duration of otitis media with effusion in the first two years of life | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = 702–711 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8229477 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(05)80843-1 }}</ref>

===Chronic suppurative otitis media===

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity that is characterised by discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane for at least 6 weeks. CSOM occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection that has led to acute otitis media. This progresses to a prolonged inflammatory response causing mucosal (middle ear) oedema, ulceration and perforation.  The middle ear attempts to resolve this ulceration by production of granulation tissue and polyp formation.  This can lead to increased discharge and failure to arrest the inflammation, and to development of CSOM, which is also often associated with [[cholesteatoma]]. There may be enough pus that it drains to the outside of the ear ('''otorrhea'''), or the pus may be minimal enough to be seen only on examination with an otoscope or binocular microscope. Hearing impairment often accompanies this disease. People are at increased risk of developing CSOM when they have poor [[eustachian tube]] function, a history of multiple episodes of acute otitis media, live in crowded conditions, and attend paediatric day care facilities.  Those with craniofacial malformations such as [[cleft lip|cleft lip and palate]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[microcephaly]] are at higher risk.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Adhesive otitis media===
Adhesive otitis media occurs when a thin [[tympanic membrane retraction|retracted ear drum]] becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the [[ossicle]]s and other bones of the middle ear.

===Antibiotics===

Use of antibiotics for acute otitis media has benefits and harms. As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one [[perforation]], and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of vomiting, diarrhea or a rash.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Venekamp |first1=Roderick P. |last2=Sanders |first2=Sharon L. |last3=Glasziou |first3=Paul P. |last4=Rovers |first4=Maroeska M. |date=2023-11-15 |title=Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=CD000219 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub5 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=10646935 |pmid=37965923|pmc-embargo-date=November 15, 2024 }}</ref> [[Analgesic]]s may relieve pain, if present.

For bilateral acute otitis media in infants younger than 24 months, there is evidence that the benefits of antibiotics outweigh the harms.<ref name=":3" /> A 2015 Cochrane review concluded that watchful waiting is the preferred approach for children over six months with non severe acute otitis media.<ref name=":3" />

Complications of acute otitis media consists of perforation of the ear drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear ([[mastoiditis]]), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as [[bacterial meningitis]], [[brain abscess]], or [[dural sinus thrombosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung TT, Alper CM, Hellstrom SO, Hunter LL, Casselbrant ML, Groth A, Kemaloglu YK, Kim SG, Lim D, Nittrouer S, Park KH, Sabo D, Spratley J | title = Panel 8: Complications and sequelae | journal =   Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery | volume = 148 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = E122–143 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23536529 | doi = 10.1177/0194599812467425 | s2cid = 206466859 }}</ref> It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of otitis media.<ref name=Mon2012 />

===Membrane rupture===
In severe or untreated cases, the tympanic membrane may [[tympanic membrane perforation|perforate]], allowing the [[pus]] in the middle-ear space to drain into the [[ear canal]]. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of the tympanic membrane suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the [[infection]] and the ear drum nearly always heals.
An option for severe acute otitis media in which analgesics are not controlling ear pain is to perform a tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the tympanic membrane to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).

===Hearing loss===
Children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media and those with otitis media with effusion or chronic suppurative otitis media have higher risks of developing [[conductive hearing loss|conductive]] and [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Globally approximately 141&nbsp;million people have mild hearing loss due to otitis media (2.1% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> This is more common in males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vos T, Flaxman AD, Naghavi M, Lozano R, Michaud C, Ezzati M, etal | title = Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal = Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9859 | pages = 2163–96 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23245607 | pmc = 6350784 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2 }}</ref>

This hearing loss is mainly due to fluid in the middle ear or rupture of the tympanic membrane. Prolonged duration of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation, contributes to the severity of the disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = da Costa SS, Rosito LP, Dornelles C | title = Sensorineural hearing loss in patients with chronic otitis media | journal = European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology | volume = 266 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–4 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 18629531 | doi = 10.1007/s00405-008-0739-0 | hdl = 10183/125807 | s2cid = 2932807 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

[[Australian Aboriginal]]s experience a high level of [[conductive hearing loss]] largely due to the massive incidence of middle ear disease among the young [[indigenous health in Australia|in Aboriginal communities]]. Aboriginal children experience middle ear disease for two and a half years on average during childhood compared with three months for non indigenous children. If untreated it can leave a permanent legacy of hearing loss.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=227116693879365;res=IELAPA |title=Damien Howard & Dianne Hampton, "Ear disease and Aboriginal families," ''Aboriginal and Islander Health Worker Journal'', July-August 2006, 30 (4) p.9. |access-date=2023-09-06 |archive-date=2023-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231016145358/https://search.informit.org/doi/10.3316/INFORMIT.227116693879365 |url-status=live }}</ref> The higher incidence of deafness in turn contributes to poor social, educational and emotional outcomes for the children concerned. Such children as they grow into adults are also more likely to experience employment difficulties and find themselves caught up in the criminal justice system.

Andrew Butcher speculates that the lack of [[fricative]]s and the unusual [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]al inventories of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian languages]] may be due to the very high presence of otitis media ear infections and resulting hearing loss in their populations. People with hearing loss often have trouble distinguishing different vowels and hearing fricatives and [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] contrasts. Australian Aboriginal languages thus seem to show similarities to the speech of people with hearing loss, and avoid those sounds and distinctions which are difficult for people with early childhood hearing loss to perceive. At the same time, Australian languages make full use of those distinctions, namely place of articulation distinctions, which people with otitis media-caused hearing loss can perceive more easily.{{sfn|Butcher|2018}} This hypothesis has been challenged on historical, comparative, statistical, and medical grounds.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Fergus |first=Anelisa |date=2019 |title=Lend Me Your Ears: Otitis Media and Aboriginal Australian languages |url=https://ling.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Anelisa%20Fergus.pdf |type=BA |access-date=2023-09-06 |archive-date=2023-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231010080239/https://ling.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Anelisa%20Fergus.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
