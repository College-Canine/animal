A '''granuloma''' is an aggregation of [[macrophage]]s (along with other cells) that forms in response to chronic [[inflammation]]. This occurs when the [[immune system]] attempts to isolate foreign substances that it is otherwise unable to eliminate.<ref name=StatPearls>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Olivia |last2=Fatima |first2=Saira |title=StatPearls |date=5 April 2020 |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |location=Treasure Island |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32119473/ |chapter=Granuloma |pmid=32119473 |access-date=2 December 2020 |archive-date=23 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523231515/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32119473/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Such substances include [[infectious organism]]s including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], as well as other materials such as [[Foreign body|foreign object]]s, [[keratin]], and [[Surgical suture|suture]] fragments.<ref name="Muk7" /><ref name="Woodard1982">{{cite journal |vauthors=Woodard BH, Rosenberg SI, Farnham R, Adams DO |title=Incidence and nature of primary granulomatous inflammation in surgically removed material |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119&ndash;129 |year=1982 |pmid=7102892 |doi= 10.1097/00000478-198203000-00004|s2cid=12907076 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunter DC, Logie JR |title=Suture granuloma |journal=British Journal of Surgery |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=1149&ndash;1150 |year=1988 |pmid=3208057 |doi= 10.1002/bjs.1800751140|s2cid=12804852 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen KT, Kostich ND, Rosai J |title=Peritoneal foreign body granulomas to keratin in uterine adenocanthoma |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=174&ndash;177 |year=1978 |pmid=580709 }}</ref>

==Definition==
In [[pathology]], a granuloma is an organized collection of macrophages.<ref name=StatPearls/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams DO |title=The granulomatous inflammatory response. A review |journal=American Journal of Pathology |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=164&ndash;191 |year=1976 |pmid=937513 |pmc=2032357}}</ref>

In medical practice, doctors occasionally use the term ''granuloma'' in its more literal meaning: "a small nodule". Since a small [[nodule (medicine)|nodule]] can represent any tissue from a harmless [[nevus]] to a [[malignant tumor]], this use of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term ''granuloma'' are the [[lesions]] known as [[vocal cord]] granuloma (known as [[contact granuloma]]), [[pyogenic granuloma]], and [[intubation granuloma]], all of which are examples of [[granulation tissue]], not granulomas. "Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma" is a lesion characterized by [[keloid]]-like fibrosis in the lung and is not granulomatous. Similarly, [[radiologists]] often use the term ''granuloma'' when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term ''granuloma'' requires a [[pathologist]] to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope.

Macrophages (specifically [[histiocyte]]s) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often fuse to form multinucleated giant cells ([[Langhans giant cell]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Kenneth |last2=Paul |first2=Travers |last3=Mark |first3=Walport |author-link3=Mark Walport |title=Janeway's immunobiology. |date=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8153-4123-9 |page=372 |edition=7th}}</ref> The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as "[[Epithelioid cell|epithelioid]]". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to [[epithelial cells]]. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages, and their cytoplasm is typically pinker when stained with [[eosin]]. These changes are thought to be a consequence of "activation" of the macrophage by the offending [[antigen]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The other key term in the above definition is the word "organized" which refers to a tight, ball-like formation. The macrophages in these formations are typically so tightly clustered that the borders of individual cells are difficult to appreciate. Loosely dispersed macrophages are not considered to be granulomas.

All granulomas, regardless of cause, may contain additional cells and [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]. These include [[lymphocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[multinucleated giant cells]], [[fibroblasts]], and [[collagen]] ([[fibrosis]]). The additional cells are sometimes a clue to the cause of the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a clue to [[coccidioidomycosis]] or allergic [[Bronchi|bronchopulmonary]] fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest [[blastomycosis]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], or [[cat-scratch disease]].

In terms of the underlying cause, the difference between granulomas and other types of inflammation is that granulomas form in response to antigens that are resistant to "first-responder" inflammatory cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[eosinophils]].  The antigen causing the formation of a granuloma is most often an infectious pathogen or a substance foreign to the body, but sometimes the offending antigen is unknown (as in [[sarcoidosis]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Granulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and noninfectious.<ref name=Muk7>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Farver CF, Vaszar LT, Dempsey OJ, Popper HH, Mani H, Capelozzi VL, Fukuoka J, Kerr KM, Zeren EH, Iyer VK, Tanaka T, Narde I, Nomikos A, Gumurdulu D, Arava S, Zander DS, Tazelaar HD |title=Causes of pulmonary granulomas: a retrospective study of 500 cases from seven countries |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology|date=Jan 2012 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=51–57 |pmid=22011444 |doi=10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200336|s2cid=28504428 }}</ref><ref name="Woodard1982" /> Infections characterized by granulomas include [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], and cat-scratch disease. Examples of noninfectious{{Clarify|reason=The Chron's disease is long been suspected to be caused by partuberculosis. I think that the rest is as well may be caused by still unkonwn or undiscovered pathogen.|date=December 2022}} granulomatous diseases are sarcoidosis, [[Crohn's disease]], [[berylliosis]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], pulmonary [[rheumatoid nodules]], and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}}

===Caseating vs Non-Caseating===
An important feature of granulomas is whether or not they contain [[necrosis]], which refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with no nuclei present. A related term, ''[[Caseous necrosis|caseation]]'' (literally: ''turning to cheese'') refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye, appears cheese-like ("caseous"), and is typically a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes.<ref name="Muk7" /> Several exceptions to this general rule exist, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.

==Diseases with granulomas==
===Tuberculosis===
''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' can cause the granulomas of [[tuberculosis]] which tend to contain necrosis ("caseating tubercules"), but non-necrotizing granulomas may also be present.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Sara B. |last2=Gern |first2=Benjamin H. |last3=Urdahl |first3=Kevin B. |date=2022-04-26 |title=The Tuberculous Granuloma and Preexisting Immunity |journal=Annual Review of Immunology |language=en |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=589–614 |doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-093019-125148 |pmid=35130029 |s2cid=246651980 |issn=0732-0582 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Multinucleated giant cells with nuclei arranged like a horseshoe (Langhans giant cell) and foreign body giant cells<ref>dental decks part II Edited by Nour</ref> are often present, but are not specific for tuberculosis.

===Leprosy===
In [[leprosy]], granulomas are found in the skin and tend to involve nerves. The appearance of the granulomas differs according to the precise type of leprosy.

===Aquarium granuloma===
The other Mycobacterium species, ''[[Mycobacterium marinum]]'' can cause a rare infection known as "[[aquarium granuloma]]."<ref>Pereira, C., Tauro, L. F., & Shetty, P. (2020). Aquarium granuloma: a diagnosis based on history. ''International Surgery Journal'', ''7''(6), 2036-2038.</ref>

===Schistosomiasis===
Some [[schistosome]] ova that are laid in intestinal and urinary venules backwash into the liver via the portal vein, causing granuloma formation in the liver.

===Histoplasmosis===
Granulomas are seen in most forms of [[histoplasmosis]] (acute histoplasmosis, histoplasmoma, chronic histoplasmosis). ''Histoplasma'' organisms can sometimes be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.<ref name="Muk7" />

===Cryptococcosis===
When ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' infection occurs in persons whose immune systems are intact, granulomatous inflammation is typically encountered. The granulomas can be necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Using a microscope and appropriate stains, organisms can be seen within the granulomas.<ref name="Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669–690"/>

===Cat-scratch disease===
Cat-scratch disease is an infection caused by the bacterial organism ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'', typically acquired by a scratch from a kitten infected with the organism. The granulomas in this disease are found in the lymph nodes draining the site of the scratch. They are characteristically "suppurative", i.e., [[pus]]-forming, containing large numbers of neutrophils. Organisms are usually difficult to find within the granulomas using methods routinely used in pathology laboratories.

===Rheumatic fever===
[[Rheumatic fever]] is a systemic disease affecting the periarteriolar connective tissue and can occur after an untreated group A, beta-hemolytic [[streptococcal]] [[Pharyngitis|pharyngeal infection]]. It is believed to be caused by antibody cross-reactivity.

===Sarcoidosis===
[[Image:Asteroid bodies high mag cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[asteroid bodies]] in [[sarcoidosis]], [[H&E stain]]]]
[[Sarcoidosis]] is a disease of unknown cause characterized by non-necrotizing ("non-caseating") granulomas in multiple organs and body sites,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Iannuzzi M, Rybicki BA, Teirstein AS |title=Sarcoidosis |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=21 |pages=2153&ndash;2165 |year=2007 |pmid=18032765 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMra071714}}</ref> most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes within the chest cavity. Other common sites of involvement include the liver, spleen, skin, and eyes. The granulomas of sarcoidosis are similar to those of tuberculosis and other infectious granulomatous diseases. In most cases of sarcoidosis, though, the granulomas do not contain necrosis and are surrounded by concentric scar tissue ([[fibrosis]]). Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures called ''[[asteroid bodies]]'' or [[lamellar]] structures termed ''[[Schaumann bodies]]'', but these structures are not specific for sarcoidosis.<ref name="Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669–690"/> Sarcoid granulomas can resolve spontaneously without complications or heal with residual scarring. In the lungs, this scarring can cause a condition known as [[pulmonary fibrosis]] that impairs breathing. In the heart, it can lead to rhythm disturbances, heart failure, and even death.

===Crohn's disease===
[[Crohn's disease]] is an inflammatory condition of uncertain cause characterized by severe inflammation in the wall of the intestines and other parts of the abdomen. Within the inflammation in the gut wall, granulomas are often found and are a clue to the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/11/teen.self.diagnosis/ | title = Teen diagnoses her own disease in science class | date = June 11, 2009 | first = Elizabeth | last = Cohen | newspaper = CNN Health | publisher = Cable News Network | access-date = June 21, 2009 | archive-date = June 16, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090616233444/http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/06/11/teen.self.diagnosis/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

===''Listeria monocytogenes''===
''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' infection in infants can cause potentially fatal disseminated granulomas, called [[granulomatosis infantiseptica]], following ''in utero'' infection.

=== ''Leishmania'' spp. ===
Leishmaniases are a group of human diseases caused by ''[[Leishmania]]'' genus and transmitted by a [[sandfly]] bite can lead to granulomatous inflammation<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=M.

===Pneumocystis pneumonia===
[[Pneumocystis]] infection in the lungs is usually not associated with granulomas, but rare cases are well documented to cause granulomatous inflammation. The diagnosis is established by finding Pneumocystis yeasts within the granulomas on lung biopsies.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hartel PH, Shilo K, Klassen-Fischer M, etal |title=Granulomatous reaction to Pneumocystis jirovecii. clinicopathologic review of 20 cases  |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=730&ndash;734 |year=2010 |pmid=20414100 |doi= 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181d9f16a|s2cid=25202257 }}</ref>

===Aspiration pneumonia===
[[Aspiration pneumonia]] is typically caused by aspiration of bacteria from the oral cavity into the lungs, and does not result in the formation of granulomas. Granulomas may form, though, when food particles or other particulate substances such as pill fragments are aspirated into the lungs. Patients typically aspirate food because they have esophageal, gastric, or neurologic problems. Intake of drugs that depress neurologic function may also lead to aspiration. The resultant granulomas are typically found around the airways (bronchioles), and are often accompanied by foreign body-type, multinucleated giant cells, acute inflammation, or organizing pneumonia. The finding of food particles in lung biopsies is diagnostic.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Katzenstein AL |title=Pulmonary disease due to aspiration of food and other particulate matter: a clinicopathologic study of 59 cases diagnosed on biopsy or resection specimens |journal=American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=752&ndash;759 |year=2007 |pmid=17460460 |doi= 10.1097/01.pas.0000213418.08009.f9|s2cid=45207101 }}</ref>

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Necrotizing granulomas can develop in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]], typically manifesting as bumps in the soft tissues around the joints (so-called rheumatoid nodules) or in the lungs.<ref name="Mukhopadhyay S, Gal AA. 2010 669–690"/>

===Granuloma annulare===
[[Granuloma annulare]] is a skin disease of unknown cause in which granulomas are found in the dermis of the skin, but it is not a true granuloma. Typically, a central zone of necrobiotic generation of collagen is seen, with surrounding inflammation and mucin deposition on pathology.

===Foreign-body granuloma===
[[File:Suture granuloma 1.jpg|thumb|Granulomatous reaction to nylon suture material]]
A [[foreign-body granuloma]] occurs when a foreign body (such as a wood splinter, piece of metal, glass etc.) penetrates the body's soft tissue followed by acute inflammation and formation of a granuloma.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Joyce |first1=S |last2=Rao Sripathi |first2=BH |last3=Mampilly |first3=MO |last4=Firdoose Nyer |first4=CS |title=Foreign Body Granuloma |journal=J Maxillofac Oral Surg |date=September 2014 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=351–4 |doi=10.1007/s12663-010-0113-9 |pmid=25018614 |pmc=4082545}}</ref> In some cases the foreign body can be found and removed even years after the precipitating event.<ref>{{cite journal | journal =  Case Reports in Orthopedics| volume = 2012 | pages = 1–2 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1155/2012/439836 | pmid = 23259122 | pmc = 3505897 | title = Foreign Body Granuloma: A Diagnosis Not to Forget | first1 = I. | last1 = El Bouchti | first2 = F. | last2 = Ait Essi | first3 = I. | last3 = Abkari | first4 = M. | last4 = Latifi | first5 = S. | last5 = El Hassani | publisher = Hindawi Publishing Corporation| doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis===
[[Childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis]] is a rare granulomatous skin disorder of unknown cause. It is temporary and tends to affect children, usually of African descent.

==Granulomas associated with vasculitis==
Certain inflammatory diseases are characterised by a combination of granulomatous inflammation and [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of the blood vessels). Both the granulomas as well as the vasculitis tend to occur in association with [[necrosis]]. Classic examples of such diseases include [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]]  and [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]].

==Etymology==
The term is {{etymology|la|grānulum|small grain}} and ''-oma'', a suffix used to indicate tumors or masses. The plural is granulomas or granulomata. The adjective granulomatous means "characterized by granulomas".
