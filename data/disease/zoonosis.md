Zoonoses have different modes of transmission. In direct zoonosis the disease is directly transmitted from non-humans to humans through media such as air (influenza) or bites and saliva (rabies).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/medical_dictionary/zonal_zoster.html#zoonosis |title=Zoonosis |work=Medical Dictionary |access-date=30 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628092144/http://www.theodora.com/medical_dictionary/zonal_zoster.html#zoonosis |archive-date=28 June 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In contrast, transmission can also occur via an intermediate species (referred to as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]), which carry the disease pathogen without getting sick.

Host genetics plays an important role in determining which non-human viruses will be able to make copies of themselves in the human body. Dangerous non-human viruses are those that require few mutations to begin replicating themselves in human cells. These viruses are dangerous since the required combinations of mutations might randomly arise in the [[natural reservoir]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren CJ, Sawyer SL | title = How host genetics dictates successful viral zoonosis | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = e3000217 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 31002666 | pmc = 6474636 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000217 | author2-link = Sara Sawyer | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Causes ==
The emergence of zoonotic diseases originated with the [[domestication]] of animals.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Nibert D |author-link=David Nibert |date=2013 |title=Animal Oppression and Human Violence: Domesecration, Capitalism, and Global Conflict |location= |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |page=5 |isbn=978-0-231-15189-4}}</ref> Zoonotic transmission can occur in any context in which there is contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives. This can occur in a companionistic (pets), economic (farming, trade, butchering, etc.), predatory (hunting, butchering, or consuming wild game), or research context.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Agbalaka |first1= P |last2= Ejinaka |first2= O |last3= Etukudoh |first3= NS |last4= Obeta |first4= U |last5= Shaahia |first5= D |last6= Utibe |first6= E |date= 2020 |title= Zoonotic and Parasitic Agents in Bioterrorism |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341655751 |journal= Journal of Infectious Diseases & Travel Medicine |volume= 4 |issue= 2 |pages= 1–7 |access-date= 1 March 2023}}</ref>

Recently, there has been a rise in frequency of appearance of new zoonotic diseases. "Approximately 1.67 million undescribed viruses are thought to exist in [[mammal]]s and birds, up to half of which are estimated to have the potential to spill over into humans", says a study<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grange ZL, Goldstein T, Johnson CK, Anthony S, Gilardi K, Daszak P, Olival KJ, O'Rourke T, Murray S, Olson SH, Togami E, Vidal G, Mazet JA | display-authors = 6 | title = Ranking the risk of animal-to-human spillover for newly discovered viruses | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 118 | issue = 15 | date = April 2021 | pmid = 33822740 | pmc = 8053939 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2002324118 | bibcode = 2021PNAS..11802324G | doi-access = free }}</ref> led by researchers at the [[University of California, Davis]]. According to a report from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and [[International Livestock Research Institute]] a large part of the causes are environmental like [[climate change]], unsustainable agriculture, exploitation of wildlife, and [[land use change]].

Many food-borne outbreaks can be linked to zoonotic pathogens. Many different types of food that have an animal origin can become contaminated. Some common food items linked to zoonotic contaminations include eggs, seafood, meat, dairy, and even some vegetables.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abebe |first1=Engidaw |last2=Gugsa |first2=Getachew |last3=Ahmed |first3=Meselu |date=29 June 2020 |title=Review on Major Food-Borne Zoonotic Bacterial Pathogens |journal=Journal of Tropical Medicine |volume=2020 |page=4674235 |doi=10.1155/2020/4674235 |issn=1687-9686 |pmc=7341400 |pmid=32684938|doi-access=free }}</ref>

{{Further|Feline zoonosis}}
Pets can transmit a number of diseases. Dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against [[rabies]]. Pets can also transmit [[ringworm]] and ''[[Giardia]]'', which are endemic in both animal and human populations. [[Toxoplasmosis]] is a common infection of cats; in humans it is a mild disease although it can be dangerous to pregnant women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html|title=Toxoplasmosis – General Information – Pregnant Women|last=Prevention|first=CDC – Centers for Disease Control and|website=cdc.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118053645/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html|archive-date=18 November 2015|access-date=1 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Dirofilariasis]] is caused by ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' through mosquitoes infected by mammals like dogs and cats. [[Cat-scratch disease]] is caused by ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' and ''[[Bartonella quintana]]'', which are transmitted by fleas that are endemic to cats. [[Toxocariasis]] is the infection of humans by any of species of [[roundworm]], including species specific to dogs (''[[Toxocara canis]])'' or cats (''[[Toxocara cati]]''). [[Cryptosporidiosis]] can be spread to humans from pet lizards, such as the [[leopard gecko]]. ''[[Encephalitozoon cuniculi]]'' is a [[microsporidia]]l parasite carried by many mammals, including rabbits, and is an important [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogen]] in people [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] by [[HIV/AIDS]], [[organ transplantation]], or [[CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity|CD4+ T-lymphocyte]] deficiency.<ref name=Weese2011>{{cite book | vauthors = Weese JS |title=Companion animal zoonoses |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0-8138-1964-8 |pages=282–84}}</ref>

Pets may also serve as a reservoir of viral disease and contribute to the chronic presence of certain viral diseases in the human population. For instance, approximately 20% of domestic dogs, cats, and horses carry anti-hepatitis E virus [[antibodies]] and thus these animals probably contribute to human hepatitis E burden as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Y, Qu C, Spee B, Zhang R, Penning LC, de Man RA, Peppelenbosch MP, Fieten H, Pan Q | display-authors = 6 | title = Hepatitis E virus seroprevalence in pets in the Netherlands and the permissiveness of canine liver cells to the infection | journal = Irish Veterinary Journal | volume = 73 | page = 6 | year = 2020 | pmid = 32266057 | pmc = 7119158 | doi = 10.1186/s13620-020-00158-y | doi-access = free }}</ref> For non-vulnerable populations (e.g., people who are not immunocompromised) the associated disease burden is, however, small.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hepatitis E |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-e |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=www.who.int |language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2024|reason=The cited source does not describe the burden of hepatitis E in "nonvulnerable populations".}} Furthermore, the trade of non domestic animals such as wild animals as pets can also increase the risk of zoonosis spread.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=D'Cruze |first1=Neil |last2=Green |first2=Jennah |last3=Elwin |first3=Angie |last4=Schmidt-Burbach |first4=Jan |date=December 2020 |title=Trading Tactics: Time to Rethink the Global Trade in Wildlife |journal=Animals |language=en |volume=10 |issue=12 |page=2456 |doi=10.3390/ani10122456 |doi-access=free |pmid=33371486 |pmc=7767496 |issn=2076-2615}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Aguirre |first1=A.

=== Hunting and bushmeat ===
{{Main|Hunting|Bushmeat}}
[[Hunting]] involves humans tracking, chasing, and capturing wild animals, primarily for food or materials like fur. However, other reasons like pest control or managing wildlife populations can also exist. Transmission of zoonotic diseases, those leaping from animals to humans, can occur through various routes: direct physical contact, airborne droplets or particles, bites or vector transport by insects, oral ingestion, or even contact with contaminated environments.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Murray |first1=Kris A. |title=Emerging Viral Zoonoses from Wildlife Associated with Animal-Based Food Systems: Risks and Opportunities |date=2016 |work=Food Safety Risks from Wildlife: Challenges in Agriculture, Conservation, and Public Health |pages=31–57 |editor-last=Jay-Russell |editor-first=Michele |series=Food Microbiology and Food Safety |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24442-6_2 |isbn=978-3-319-24442-6 |last2=Allen |first2=Toph |last3=Loh |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Machalaba |first4=Catherine |last5=Daszak |first5=Peter |editor2-last=Doyle |editor2-first=Michael P.}}</ref> Wildlife activities like hunting and trade bring humans closer to dangerous zoonotic pathogens, threatening global health.<ref name="Problematic Wildlife">{{Cite book |last1=Kurpiers |first1=Laura A. |last2=Schulte-Herbrüggen |first2=Björn |last3=Ejotre |first3=Imran |last4=Reeder |first4=DeeAnn M. |chapter=Bushmeat and Emerging Infectious Diseases: Lessons from Africa |date=2015-09-21 |title=Problematic Wildlife |pages=507–551 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-22246-2_24 |pmc=7123567|isbn=978-3-319-22245-5 }}</ref>

According to the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) hunting and consuming wild animal meat ("bushmeat") in regions like Africa can expose people to infectious diseases due to the types of animals involved, like bats and primates. Unfortunately, common preservation methods like smoking or drying aren't enough to eliminate these risks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-21 |title=Bushmeat Importation Policies {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bushmeat.html |access-date=2024-01-12 |website=www.cdc.gov |language=en-us}}</ref> Although bushmeat provides protein and income for many, the practice is intricately linked to numerous emerging infectious diseases like Ebola, HIV, and [[SARS]], raising critical public health concerns.<ref name="Problematic Wildlife"/>

===Deforestation, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation===
{{Main|Deforestation| Biodiversity loss|Environmental degradation}}
[[Kate Jones (scientist)|Kate Jones]], Chair of Ecology and Biodiversity at [[University College London]], says zoonotic diseases are increasingly linked to environmental change and human behavior. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanization, and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before. The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now "a hidden cost of human economic development".<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Vidal J |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe|title='Tip of the iceberg': is our destruction of nature responsible for Covid-19?|date=18 March 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 March 2020|issn=0261-3077|archive-date=20 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320095435/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe|url-status=live}}</ref> In a guest article, published by [[IPBES]], President of the [[EcoHealth Alliance]] and zoologist [[Peter Daszak]], along with three co-chairs of the 2019 ''[[Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]'', Josef Settele, [[Sandra Díaz (ecologist)|Sandra Díaz]], and Eduardo Brondizio, wrote that "rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, [[intensive farming]], mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a 'perfect storm' for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people."<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Carrington D |date=27 April 2020 |title=Halt destruction of nature or suffer even worse pandemics, say world's top scientists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists |work=The Guardian |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=15 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515015940/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists |url-status=live }}</ref>

An April 2020 study, published in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]''{{'s}} [[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|Part B]] journal, found that increased virus spillover events from animals to humans can be linked to [[biodiversity loss]] and [[environmental degradation]], as humans further encroach on wildlands to engage in agriculture, hunting, and resource extraction they become exposed to pathogens which normally would remain in these areas. Such spillover events have been tripling every decade since 1980.<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Shield C |title=Coronavirus Pandemic Linked to Destruction of Wildlife and World's Ecosystems |url=https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-pandemic-linked-to-destruction-of-wildlife-and-worlds-ecosystems/a-53078480 |access-date=16 April 2020 |agency=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=16 April 2020 |archive-date=16 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416034115/https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-pandemic-linked-to-destruction-of-wildlife-and-worlds-ecosystems/a-53078480 |url-status=live }}</ref> An August 2020 study, published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', concludes that the [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]] destruction of ecosystems for the purpose of expanding agriculture and human settlements reduces biodiversity and allows for smaller animals such as bats and rats, which are more adaptable to human pressures and also carry the most zoonotic diseases, to proliferate. This in turn can result in more pandemics.<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Carrington D |date=5 August 2020 |title=Deadly diseases from wildlife thrive when nature is destroyed, study finds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/05/deadly-diseases-from-wildlife-thrive-when-nature-is-destroyed-study-finds |work=The Guardian |access-date=7 August 2020 |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806223417/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/05/deadly-diseases-from-wildlife-thrive-when-nature-is-destroyed-study-finds |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2020, the [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] published its report on the 'era of pandemics' by 22 experts in a variety of fields and concluded that anthropogenic destruction of [[biodiversity]] is paving the way to the pandemic era and could result in as many as 850,000 viruses being transmitted from animals – in particular birds and mammals – to humans. The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the "exponential rise" in consumption and trade of commodities such as meat, [[palm oil]], and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a [[Population growth|growing human population]]. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, "there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic.

=== Climate change ===
{{Further|Climate change and infectious diseases}}
According to a report from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and [[International Livestock Research Institute]], entitled "Preventing the next pandemic – Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission", climate change is one of the 7 human-related causes of the increase in the number of zoonotic diseases.<ref name="bbc.com" /><ref name="United Nations" /> The University of Sydney issued a study, in March 2021, that examines factors increasing the likelihood of [[epidemic]]s and pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers found that "pressure on ecosystems, climate change and economic development are key factors" in doing so. More zoonotic diseases were found in [[High-income country|high-income countries]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Factors that may predict next pandemic |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210330092524.htm |website=ScienceDaily |publisher=University of Sydney |access-date=19 May 2021 |archive-date=19 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519091224/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210330092524.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

A 2022 study dedicated to the link between climate change and zoonosis found a strong link between climate change and the epidemic emergence in the last 15 years, as it caused a massive migration of species to new areas, and consequently contact between species which do not normally come in contact with one another. Even in a scenario with weak climatic changes, there will be 15,000 spillover of viruses to new hosts in the next decades. The areas with the most possibilities for spillover are the mountainous tropical regions of Africa and southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is especially vulnerable as it has a large number of bat species that generally do not mix, but could easily if climate change forced them to begin migrating.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yong |first1=Ed |title=We Created the 'Pandemicene' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/how-climate-change-impacts-pandemics/629699/ |access-date=6 May 2022 |agency=The Atlantic |date=28 April 2022}}</ref>

A 2021 study found possible links between climate change and transmission of COVID-19 through bats. The authors suggest that climate-driven changes in the distribution and robustness of bat species harboring coronaviruses may have occurred in eastern Asian hotspots (southern China, Myanmar, and Laos), constituting a driver behind the evolution and spread of the virus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beyer RM, Manica A, Mora C | title = Shifts in global bat diversity suggest a possible role of climate change in the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 767 | page = 145413 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 33558040 | pmc = 7837611 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145413 | bibcode = 2021ScTEn.767n5413B | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Bressan D |title=Climate Change Could Have Played A Role In The Covid-19 Outbreak|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2021/02/08/climate-change-could-have-played-a-role-in-the-covid-19-outbreak/|access-date=9 February 2021|website=Forbes}}</ref>

===Secondary transmission===
{{expand section|date=August 2020}}
* Ebola and [[Marburg virus|Marburg]] are examples of [[viral hemorrhagic disease]].

== History ==
During most of human [[prehistory]] groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] were probably very small. Such groups probably made contact with other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals who have not yet developed an adequate [[immune response]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Concepts of Disease |url=https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_history/ep713_history2.html |access-date=22 April 2022 |website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu}}</ref> To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Seventer |first1=Jean Maguire |last2=Hochberg |first2=Natasha S. |date=2017 |title=Principles of Infectious Diseases:Transmission, Diagnosis, Prevention, and Control |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |pages=22–39 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-803678-5.00516-6 |pmc=7150340|isbn=978-0-12-803708-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Health (US) |first1=National Institutes of |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20370/ |title=Understanding Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases |last2=Study |first2=Biological Sciences Curriculum |date=2007 |publisher=National Institutes of Health (US) }}</ref> In fact, for many "human" diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a [[dead-end host]]. Examples include rabies, anthrax, tularemia, and West Nile fever. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baum |first=Stephen G. |date=2008 |title=Zoonoses-With Friends Like This, Who Needs Enemies? |journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association |volume=119 |pages=39–52 |issn=0065-7778 |pmc=2394705 |pmid=18596867}}</ref>
[[File:Figure 3- Examples of Zoonotic Diseases and Their Affected Populations (6323431516).jpg|thumb|Possibilities for zoonotic disease transmissions]]

Many diseases, even epidemic ones, have zoonotic origin and [[measles]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], HIV, and [[diphtheria]] are particular examples.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Robin A |last2=Sankaran |first2=Neeraja |date=18 January 2022 |title=Emergence of epidemic diseases: zoonoses and other origins |journal=Faculty Reviews |volume=11 |page=2 |doi=10.12703/r/11-2 |issn=2732-432X |pmc=8808746 |pmid=35156099 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=Nathan D. |last2=Dunavan |first2=Claire Panosian |last3=Diamond |first3=Jared |date=May 2007 |title=Origins of major human infectious diseases |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7142 |pages=279–283 |doi=10.1038/nature05775 |pmid=17507975 |pmc=7095142 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..279W |issn=1476-4687}}</ref> Various forms of the [[common cold]] and [[tuberculosis]] also are adaptations of strains originating in other species.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Some experts have suggested that all human viral infections were originally zoonotic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benatar D | title = The chickens come home to roost | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 9 | pages = 1545–1546 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17666704 | pmc = 1963309 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.090431 | author-link = David Benatar }}</ref>

Zoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus [[West Nile virus in the United States#Discovery in the United States|first appeared in the United States in 1999]], in the New York City area. [[Bubonic plague]] is a zoonotic disease,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A | title = Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health | journal = Critical Reviews in Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–270 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19548807 | doi = 10.1080/10408410902989837 | s2cid = 205694138 }}</ref> as are [[salmonellosis]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], and [[Lyme disease]].

A major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daszak P, Cunningham AA, Hyatt AD | title = Anthropogenic environmental change and the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–116 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11230820 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-706X(00)00179-0 }}</ref> This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of [[Henipavirus#Nipah virus|Nipah virus]] in peninsular Malaysia, in 1999, when [[intensive pig farming]] began within the habitat of infected fruit bats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Looi |first1=Lai-Meng |last2=Chua |first2=Kaw-Bing |title=Lessons from the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia |journal=Malaysian Journal of Pathology |date=2007 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=63–67 |pmid=19108397}}</ref> The unidentified infection of these pigs amplified the force of infection, transmitting the virus to farmers, and eventually causing 105 human deaths.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Field H, Young P, Yob JM, Mills J, Hall L, Mackenzie J | title = The natural history of Hendra and Nipah viruses | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–314 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11334748 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01384-3 }}</ref>

Similarly, in recent times avian influenza and West Nile virus have [[Spillover infection|spilled over]] into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Highly mobile animals, such as bats and birds, may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.

Because they depend on the human host<ref>{{cite web |last=Basu |first=Dr Muktisadhan |date=16 August 2022 |title=Zoonotic Diseases and Its Impact on Human Health |url=https://agritechconsultancyservices.com/zoonotic-diseases-and-its-impact-on-human-health/ |access-date=25 March 2023 |website=Agritech Consultancy Services}}</ref> for part of their life-cycle, diseases such as African [[schistosomiasis]], [[river blindness]], and [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]] are ''not'' defined as zoonotic, even though they may depend on transmission by insects or other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].<ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}</ref>

== Use in vaccines ==
The first vaccine against smallpox by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1800 was by infection of a zoonotic bovine virus which caused a disease called [[cowpox]].<ref>{{cite web|date=21 February 2021|title=History of Smallpox {{!}} Smallpox {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/history.html|access-date=21 September 2021|website=www.cdc.gov|archive-date=14 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614213232/https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/history.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Jenner had noticed that milkmaids were resistant to smallpox. Milkmaids contracted a milder version of the disease from infected cows that conferred cross immunity to the human disease. Jenner abstracted an infectious preparation of 'cowpox' and subsequently used it to inoculate persons against smallpox. As a result of vaccination, smallpox has been eradicated globally, and mass inoculation against this disease ceased in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/history/smallpox-origin.html|title=The Spread and Eradication of Smallpox &#124; Smallpox &#124; CDC|date=19 February 2019}}</ref> There are a variety of vaccine types, including traditional inactivated pathogen vaccines, [[Subunit vaccine|subunit vaccines]], [[Attenuated vaccine|live attenuated vaccines]]. There are also new vaccine technologies such as viral vector vaccines and [[MRNA vaccine|DNA/RNA vaccines]], which include many of the [[COVID-19 vaccine|COVID-19 vaccines]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mayo Clinic Staff |date=4 November 2023 |title=Different types of COVID-19 vaccines: How they work |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/different-types-of-covid-19-vaccines/art-20506465 |access-date=4 April 2024 |website=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>
