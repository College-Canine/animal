'''Bromethalin''' is a neurotoxic [[rodenticide]] that damages the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=dreikorn1984/>

==History==
Bromethalin was discovered in the early 1980s through an approach to find replacement rodenticides for first-generation anticoagulants, especially to be useful against rodents that had become resistant to [[Warfarin|Warfarin-type]] anticoagulant poisons. A structured study was undertaken to [[new product development|develop]] a substance that would be both poisonous to rodents, but also would be readily eaten by rodents. Bromethalin—N-[[methyl]]-2,4-[[Nitro compound|dinitro]]-N ([[2,4,6-Tribromophenol|2,4,6-tribromophenyl]])-6-([[trifluoromethyl]]) [[Benzenamine|benzeneamine]]— was the outcome of that study, as the specific formulation had both desired rodenticidal properties.<ref name=dreikorn1984>{{cite book |chapter=The Discovery and Development of Bromethalin, an Acute Rodenticide with a Unique Mode of Action |doi=10.1021/bk-1984-0255.ch004 |title=Pesticide Synthesis Through Rational Approaches |series=ACS Symposium Series |year=1984 |last1=Dreikorn|first1=Barry A. |last2=O'Doherty|first2=George O. P. |volume=255 |pages=45–63 |isbn=0-8412-0852-2 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Bromethalin works by being metabolised to n-desmethyl-bromethalin and uncoupling [[mitochondria]]l [[oxidative phosphorylation]], which causes a decrease in [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) synthesis. The decreased ATP inhibits the activity of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na/K ATPase enzyme]], thereby leading to a subsequent buildup of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and [[Vacuole|vacuolization]] of [[myelin]]. The excess CSF results in increased [[intracranial pressure]], which in turn permanently damages [[neuronal]] [[axon]]s.  This damage to the central nervous system can cause [[paralysis]], [[convulsion]]s, and [[death]].<ref name=dreikorn1984/><ref name=purdue1997>[http://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/1997/spring/bromoethalin.shtml Bromethalin], Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Spring 1997 Newsletter</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2021}}

==Risk of poisoning to humans and pets==
Despite risk of severe symptoms and death, most unintentional pediatric exploratory exposures (licking or tasting a pellet) have not shown serious effects, and no deaths have been reported at this time in children, though toxicity is possible if significant amounts are ingested.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=Ryan|last2=Stanton|first2=Matthew|last3=Borys|first3=Douglas|last4=Kostic|first4=Mark|last5=Gummin|first5=David|date=November 2019|title=Medical outcomes of bromethalin rodenticide exposures reported to US poison centers after federal restriction of anticoagulants|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=57|issue=11|pages=1109–1114|doi=10.1080/15563650.2019.1582776|issn=1556-9519|pmid=30892957|doi-access=free}}</ref> Due to need for active metabolite generation to produce toxicity, fatal toxicity may be delayed by hours to days.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pasquale-Styles|first1=Melissa A.|last2=Sochaski|first2=Mark A.|last3=Dorman|first3=David C.|last4=Krell|first4=Willane S.|last5=Shah|first5=Aashit K.|last6=Schmidt|first6=Carl J.|date=September 2006|title=Fatal bromethalin poisoning|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17018099/|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=51|issue=5|pages=1154–1157|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2006.00218.x|issn=0022-1198|pmid=17018099|s2cid=33324699 }}</ref> All cases should be managed in consultation with a local [[poison control center]].  All intentional ingestions for self harm carry significant risk of death or severe neurologic effects and require monitoring in a hospital setting.<ref name=":0" />

In humans the most common initial effects of unintentional exposure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, though delayed seizures have been reported.<ref name=":0" />  No antidote for bromethalin is known; care is symptomatic and supportive.

In pets, signs to watch for include severe muscle [[tremor]]s, hyperexcitability, fits, extreme sensitivity to being touched ([[hyperesthesia]]) and [[seizure]]s that appear to be caused by light or noise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Michael E.|date=February 2013|title=Bromethalin|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23796484/|journal=Topics in Companion Animal Medicine|volume=28|issue=1|pages=21–23|doi=10.1053/j.tcam.2013.03.005|issn=1946-9837|pmid=23796484}}</ref> Owners of animals that have eaten bromethalin accidentally should seek immediate veterinary attention and be decontaminated.  Contacting an animal poison control center can help ensure that timely and appropriate therapy is started.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}
