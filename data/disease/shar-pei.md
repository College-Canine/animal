The '''Shar Pei''' ({{zh|cy=shā pèih|first=j|c=沙皮|p=shā pí}}) is a [[dog breed]] from 
[[South China|southern China]]. Traditionally kept as a property guardian, the shar pei was driven to the brink of extinction in the 20th century. The breed is known in the West for its deep [[wrinkles]], while a traditional less wrinkled form is maintained in [[Hong Kong]].

There are no records indicating the origins of the shar pei, although it closely resembles effigies of an un-wrinkled type of [[guard dog]] kept in southern China during the [[Han dynasty]]; some believe the modern breed, along with the [[chow chow]], descends from these dogs.{{r|Morris|Tatler}} The breed has been identified as a [[Dog breed#Basal breeds|basal breed]] that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.{{r|Larson}}

The shar pei was once very popular, but war and political turmoil in China in the 20th century took its toll on the breed and by the 1970s it was close to extinction.{{r|Morris|Tatler}} In 1973 a Hong Kong businessman named Matgo Law appealed to the international community, in particular the [[American Kennel Club]], to help save the breed; by 1978 the breed was named by ''[[The Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the world’s rarest breed, with only 60 remaining.{{r|Morris|Tatler|Fogle}} The resultant publicity led to great demand in the United States for examples of the breed, and unscrupulous breeders in Hong Kong, [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]] took to crossing their remaining purebred animals with other breeds including the [[bull terrier]], [[pug]] and [[bulldog]], and selling the offspring to unwitting American buyers.{{r|Tatler}} The results of the crossings led to a dog with a much fleshier mouth than the original breed, these dogs became known as "meat-mouth" shar peis, while the original dogs are called "bone-mouth" shar peis.{{r|Tatler}}

The cause of saving the breed was taken up in the United States by enthusiastic breeders using the dogs smuggled there in the 1970s, a breed club was founded and it received American Kennel Club recognition in 1992, with breed standard specifying a meat-mouth type dog.{{r|Morris|Tatler}} Some breeders in Hong Kong maintain the traditional bone-mouth type, although it is estimated only 50 to 100 examples of this type remain.{{r|Tatler}}

In the United States, a number of breeders have selectively bred shar peis for a smaller size, creating what they call the "miniature shar pei", much to the opposition of many breeders of traditionally sized shar peis.{{r|Morris}} Standing to a maximum {{convert|40|cm|in}}, the miniature shar pei is bred for both for its smaller size and increased wrinkles.{{r|Morris}}

== Description ==
[[File:Sharpei tongue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|"Meat-mouth" shar pei showing the blue-black tongue]]
The shar pei is a short-coated medium-sized breed of dog, renowned for its excessively wrinkled skin. The breed resembles many dog breeds from the [[mastiff]] family; however, it is most closely related to [[spitz]] breeds, with the chow chow being its closest relative. This is most clearly seen with the two breeds both possessing unique blue-black tongues.{{r|Morris|Fogle|Wilcox-Walkowicz}} This dog falls within the same genetic group as the chow-chow, the [[Akita (dog)|akita]], the [[shiba inu]], the [[malamute]] and the [[Greenland dog]].<ref name=Parker2017/>

Adult shar peis typically stand between {{convert|44|and|51|cm|in}} and weigh between {{convert|16|and|20|kg|lb}}, they have a short, very harsh coat that can be any solid colour except white, although black, red, fawn and cream are the most common.{{r|Fogle|Banks}}

The Chinese breed standard states they have clam-shell ears, butterfly nose, melon-shaped head, grandmotherly face, water buffalo neck, horse's buttocks and dragon's legs.{{r|Fogle}} The breed's head is relatively large compared to its body with a broad muzzle that usually darker than the rest of the coat and well padded causing a bulge at its base, the ears are set wide apart and are small and triangular, and the eyes are set very deeply into the folds of skin on the head.{{r|Fogle|Banks}} The breed has straight, well boned, muscular legs below sloping shoulders and a medium length broad tail that is curled over their back in a manner typical of spitz-type dogs.{{r|Fogle|Banks}}

===Life expectancy===
A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 10.6 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for [[Mongrel|crossbreeds]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=McMillan | first=Kirsten M. | last2=Bielby | first2=Jon | last3=Williams | first3=Carys L. | last4=Upjohn | first4=Melissa M. | last5=Casey | first5=Rachel A. | last6=Christley | first6=Robert M. | title=Longevity of companion dog breeds: those at risk from early death | journal=Scientific Reports | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=14 | issue=1 | date=2024-02-01 | issn=2045-2322 | doi=10.1038/s41598-023-50458-w | page=| pmc=10834484 }}</ref>

===Familial Shar Pei Fever===
[[Image:Botox, resting, Winter 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A Shar Pei with Shar Pei Fever]]

'''Shar Pei fever''' (also called '''familial Shar Pei fever''' or '''FSF''') is a condition seen in [[Shar Pei]] characterized by recurring [[fever]] and swelling of the [[hock (zoology)|hock]]s. It is similar to [[familial Mediterranean fever]] in humans.  The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be inherited.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  Shar Pei fever can result in [[chronic renal failure|renal]] and [[liver failure]] through accumulation of [[amyloid]] in those organs (amyloidosis).

Affected Shar Pei have an elevated level of [[interleukin 6]], and this leads to an accumulation of [[acute phase protein]]s in the body during the fevers.  The acute phase proteins are broken down to form type AA amyloid, which deposits in the [[kidney]]s and less so in the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tellier L |title=Immune-mediated vasculitis in a shar-pei with swollen hock syndrome |journal=Can Vet J |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=137–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11272460 |pmc=1476484}}</ref>  This eventually leads to kidney or liver failure by the age of six years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

The symptoms of Shar Pei fever include fever, swelling, and pain in the hocks that usually resolves within two days. The swelling in the hocks is easily recognizable—the hock will resemble a flaccid waterballoon, rather than stiff swelling following a sprain or break. The symptoms can be treated with [[NSAID]]s such as [[carprofen]].  Kidney and liver failure cannot be treated except by the conventional manner usually used for those diseases.  Prevention of amyloidosis is sometimes used in dogs with recurring episodes of Shar Pei fever.  [[Colchicine]] and [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] are most commonly used.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>
The disease is associated with the Western type and it is estimated that 23% of dogs in the US are affected.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Olsson | first1 = M. | last2 = Meadows | first2 = J. R.

===Other conditions===
The Shar-pei is prediposed to [[hypothyroidism]].<ref name="small animal dermatology"/>

A common problem is a painful eye condition, [[entropion]], in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. If untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery—"tacking" up the eyelids so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies, or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older shar peis.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N.
