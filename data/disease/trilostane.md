==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Steroidogenesis]]. Trilostane inhibits 3β-HSD.]]

Trilostane is a [[steroidogenesis inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid17109615" /> It is specifically an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3β-HSD).<ref name="pmid17109615" /><ref name="pmid21295836">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Gier J, Wolthers CH, Galac S, Okkens AC, Kooistra HS | title = Effects of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor trilostane on luteal progesterone production in the dog | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 75 | issue = 7 | pages = 1271–1279 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21295836 | doi = 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.11.041 }}</ref> As a result of this action, trilostane blocks the conversion of Δ<sup>5</sup>-3β-[[hydroxysteroid]]s, including [[pregnenolone]], [[17α-hydroxypregnenolone]], [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), and [[androstenediol]], into Δ<sup>4</sup>-3-[[ketosteroid]]s, including [[progesterone]], [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]], [[androstenedione]], and [[testosterone]], respectively.<ref name="pmid17109615" /> Consequently, trilostane inhibits the [[biosynthesis|production]] of all classes of [[steroid hormone]]s, including [[androgen]]s, [[estrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, and [[mineralocorticoid]]s.<ref name="pmid17109615" />

The [[mechanism of action]] of trilostane in Cushing's syndrome and Conn's syndrome is by inhibiting the production of corticosteroids such as [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]] in the [[adrenal gland]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caninediabeteswiki.wikkii.com/w/images/caninediabeteswiki/uploads/8/87/2006symposiumproceedings.pdf|title=Trilostane-5 Years of Clinical Experience for the Treatment of Cushing's Disease| vauthors = Reusch CE |year=2006|publisher=Ohio State University Endocrinology Symposium|pages=17–19|access-date=5 April 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([[PDF]])</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2010&Category=&PID=56127&O=Generic|title=Trilostane-A Review of a Success Story| vauthors = Reusch CE |year=2010|publisher=World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA)|access-date=5 April 2011}}</ref> Trilostane has also been used as an [[abortifacient]] due to its inhibition of progesterone synthesis.<ref name="pmid17109615" /><ref name="pmid12042266">{{cite journal | vauthors = le Roux PA, Tregoning SK, Zinn PM, van der Spuy ZM | title = Inhibition of progesterone secretion with trilostane for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy: randomized controlled trials | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1483–1489 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12042266 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/17.6.1483 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Trilostane is not an [[aromatase inhibitor]] and hence does not inhibit the conversion of androgens like androstenedione and testosterone into estrogens like [[estrone]] and [[estradiol]].<ref name="pmid17109615" /> However, trilostane may nonetheless inhibit estrogen synthesis by inhibiting androgen synthesis.<ref name="pmid17109615" />

In addition to steroidogenesis inhibition, trilostane has been found to act as a [[noncompetitive inhibition|noncompetitive]] [[antiestrogen]], via direct and presumably [[allosteric]] interactions with the [[estrogen receptor]].<ref name="pmid17109615" /><ref name="pmid12209583">{{cite journal | vauthors = Puddefoot JR, Barker S, Glover HR, Malouitre SD, Vinson GP | title = Non-competitive steroid inhibition of oestrogen receptor functions | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–22 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12209583 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.10547 | s2cid = 25779906 | doi-access =  }}</ref><ref name="GloverBarker2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Beatson GT | title = On the Treatment of Inoperable Cases of Carcinoma of the Mamma: Suggestions for a New Method of Treatment, with Illustrative Cases | journal = Transactions.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Trilostane is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]].<ref name="pmid17109615" /> The major [[metabolite]] of trilostane is 17-ketotrilostane.<ref name="pmid17109615" /> The conversion of trilostane into 17-ketotrilostane is [[reversible reaction|reversible]], suggesting that trilostane and 17-ketotrilostane undergo interconversion in the body.<ref name="pmid17109615" /> 17-Ketotrilostane circulates at 3-fold higher levels than trilostane and is more active than trilostane as a 3β-HSD inhibitor.<ref name="pmid17109615" /> The [[elimination half-life|elimination half-lives]] of trilostane and 17-ketotrilostane are both 1.2&nbsp;hours, with both compounds cleared from the blood within 6 to 8&nbsp;hours of a dose of trilostane.<ref name="pmid17109615" /> 17-Ketotrilostane is [[excretion|excreted]] by the [[kidney]]s.<ref name="pmid17109615" />

==Chemistry==
Trilostane, also known as 4α,5-epoxy-3,17β-dihydroxy-5α-androst-2-ene-2-carbonitrile, is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[5α-reductase|5α-reduced]] androstane derivatives like [[3α-androstanediol]], [[3β-androstanediol]], and [[dihydrotestosterone]].<ref name="Elks2014" />
