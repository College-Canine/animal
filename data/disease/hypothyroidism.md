==Causes==

Hypothyroidism is caused by inadequate function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the [[pituitary gland]] (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] from the brain's [[hypothalamus]] (tertiary hypothyroidism).<ref name="Garber" /><ref name="Gaitonde2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaitonde DY, Rowley KD, Sweeney LB | title = Hypothyroidism: an update | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–51 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22962987 | url = https://www.aafp.org/linked_out?pmid=22962987 }}</ref> Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.<ref name="Persani2012" /> Central hypothyroidism is the name used for secondary and tertiary, since hypothalamus and pituitary gland are at the center of thyroid hormone control.

[[Iodine deficiency]] is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism and [[endemic goitre]] worldwide.<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Chakera/> In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis).<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Chakera/> Hashimoto's may be associated with a goitre. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] [[Anti-thyroid autoantibodies|against specific thyroid antigens]] such as [[thyroid peroxidase]], [[thyroglobulin]] and the [[thyrotropin receptor|TSH receptor]].<ref name=Garber/>

A more uncommon cause of hypothyroidism is [[estrogen dominance]]. It is one of the most common hormone imbalance problems in women, but is not always link with hypothyroidism<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Hormonal Imbalance: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22673-hormonal-imbalance |access-date=2023-03-22 |website=Cleveland Clinic |language=en}}</ref> There are three different types of estrogens: estrone (E1), [[estradiol]] (E2), and estriol (E3), with estradiol being the most potent of the three<ref name=":0" />{{Failed verification|date=March 2023}} Women with estrogen dominance have estradiol levels of 115 pg/ml on day 3 of their cycle. However, estrogen dominance is not just about an over abundance of estradiol, but is more likely correlated with an imbalance between estradiol and [[progesterone]]. Women who have too much unopposed estrogen, which is estrogen that does not have enough counterbalancing progesterone in their bodies, commonly have unbalanced thyroid levels, in addition to excess growths within their uteri.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Friends or Foes?

Estradiol disrupts thyroid hormone production because high blood levels of estrogen signal the liver to increase the production of [[Thyroxine-binding globulin|thyroid-binding globulin]] (TBG).

Thyroxine levels decrease TRH and TSH production by a negative feedback process.]]

Thyroid hormone is required for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In healthy individuals, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), which is converted into [[triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>) in other organs by the [[selenium]]-dependent enzyme [[iodothyronine deiodinase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maia AL, Goemann IM, Meyer EL, Wajner SM | title = Deiodinases: the balance of thyroid hormone: type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase in human physiology and disease | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 209 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–97 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21415143 | doi = 10.1530/JOE-10-0481 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Triiodothyronine binds to the [[thyroid hormone receptor]] in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of cells, where it stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|turning on]] of particular [[gene]]s and the production of specific proteins.<ref name=Cheng>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng SY, Leonard JL, Davis PJ | title = Molecular aspects of thyroid hormone actions | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–70 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20051527 | pmc = 2852208 | doi = 10.1210/er.2009-0007 }}</ref> Additionally, the hormone binds to [[Alpha-v beta-3|integrin αvβ3]] on the [[cell membrane]], thereby stimulating the [[sodium–hydrogen antiporter]] and processes such as [[angiogenesis|formation of blood vessels]] and [[cell growth]].<ref name=Cheng/> In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) are bound to plasma proteins such as [[thyroxine-binding globulin]]; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.<ref name=Garber/>

[[Electrocardiography|Electrocardiograms]] are abnormal in both primary overt hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism.<ref name="pmid38019451" /> T3 and TSH are essential for regulation of cardiac electrical activity.<ref name="pmid38019451" /> Prolonged ventricular repolarization and [[atrial fibrillation]] are often seen in hypothyroidism.<ref name="pmid38019451" />

The thyroid gland is the only source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process requires [[iodine]] and the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]]. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into [[thyroglobulin]] molecules. The process is controlled by the [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]]. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.<ref name=Gaitonde2012/>

The [[hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis]] plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a [[negative feedback]] process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production.<ref name=Persani2012/>

Pregnancy leads to marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is increased in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (as evidenced by autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism before or after giving birth.<ref name=Stagnaro>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stagnaro-Green A, Abalovich M, Alexander E, Azizi F, Mestman J, Negro R, Nixon A, Pearce EN, Soldin OP, Sullivan S, Wiersinga W | title = Guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and postpartum | journal = Thyroid | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 1081–125 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21787128 | pmc = 3472679 | doi = 10.1089/thy.2011.0087 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Thyroid function tests}}

Many cases of hypothyroidism are associated with mild elevations in [[creatine kinase]] and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated.<ref name=Garber/> Levels of [[cholesterol]], [[low-density lipoprotein]] and [[lipoprotein(a)|lipoprotein (a)]] can be elevated;<ref name=Garber/> the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.<ref name=Pearce/>

Very severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma are characteristically associated with [[hyponatremia|low sodium levels in the blood]] together with elevations in [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]], as well as [[Acute kidney injury|acute worsening of kidney function]] due to a number of causes.<ref name=Klubo/> In most causes, however, it is unclear if the relationship is causal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantalone KM, Hatipoglu BA | title = Hyponatremia and the Thyroid: Causality or Association? | journal = Journal of Clinical Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–6 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 26237016 | pmc = 4470237 | doi = 10.3390/jcm4010032 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

A diagnosis of hypothyroidism without any [[Thyroid nodule|lumps or masses]] [[Palpation|felt]] within the thyroid gland does not require thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended.<ref name=So2012/> The presence of antibodies against [[thyroid peroxidase]] (TPO) makes it more likely that thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a [[fine-needle aspiration|needle biopsy]] may be required.<ref name=Garber/>

===Central===
If the TSH level is normal or low and serum free T<sub>4</sub> levels are low, this is suggestive of '''central hypothyroidism''' (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There may be other features of [[hypopituitarism]], such as [[menstrual cycle]] abnormalities and [[adrenal insufficiency]]. There might also be symptoms of a [[pituitary adenoma|pituitary mass]] such as [[headache]]s and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.<ref name=Persani2012/><ref name=So2012/>

===Overt===
In overt primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high and T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels are low. Overt hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in those who have a TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Don2009>{{cite book|last1=Dons|first1=Robert F.|last2=Wians|first2=Frank H.

===Subclinical===
Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level.<ref name="Peters 2017">{{cite journal |last1=Peeters |first1=Robin P. |title=Subclinical Hypothyroidism |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=29 June 2017 |volume=376 |issue=26 |pages=2556–2565 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1611144|pmid=28657873 |s2cid=56184355 }}</ref><ref name=Bona2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bona G, Prodam F, Monzani A | title = Subclinical hypothyroidism in children: natural history and when to treat | journal = Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology | volume = 5 Suppl 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 23–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23154159 | pmc = 3608012 | doi = 10.4274/jcrpe.851 | type = Review }}</ref><ref name=Fatourechi/> The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3-15% and a higher incidence is seen in elderly people, females and those with lower iodine levels.<ref name="Peters 2017" /> Subclinical hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by autoimmune thyroid diseases, especially [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]].<ref name=Baumgartner2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baumgartner C, Blum MR, Rodondi N | title = Subclinical hypothyroidism: summary of evidence in 2014 | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 144 | pages = w14058 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25536449 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2014.14058 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}</ref>  The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may not be observed.<ref name=Bona2013/> Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year.

===Pregnancy===
During pregnancy, the thyroid gland must produce 50% more thyroid hormone to provide enough thyroid hormone for the developing fetus and the expectant mother.<ref name="Negro2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Negro R, Stagnaro-Green A | title = Diagnosis and management of subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | issue = 10 | pages = g4929 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25288580 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g4929 | s2cid = 21104809 }}</ref>  In pregnancy, free thyroxine levels may be lower than anticipated due to increased binding to [[thyroid binding globulin]] and decreased binding to [[albumin]]. They should either be corrected for the stage of pregnancy,<ref name=Stagnaro/> or total thyroxine levels should be used instead for diagnosis.<ref name=Garber/> TSH values may also be lower than normal (particularly in the [[first trimester]]) and the normal range should be adjusted for the stage of pregnancy.<ref name=Garber/><ref name=Stagnaro/>

In pregnancy, subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a TSH between 2.5 and 10&nbsp;mIU/L with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10&nbsp;mIU/L are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal.<ref name=Stagnaro/> Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.<ref name=Garber/>

==Prevention==

Hypothyroidism may be prevented in a population by adding iodine to commonly used foods.

==Screening==
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] for hypothyroidism is performed in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH.

===Myxedema coma===
[[Myxedema coma]] or severe [[Decompensation|decompensated]] hypothyroidism usually requires admission to the [[intensive care unit|intensive care]], close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. [[Mechanical ventilation]] may be required, as well as [[fluid replacement]], [[Antihypotensive agent|vasopressor agents]], careful rewarming, and [[corticosteroid]]s (for possible [[adrenal insufficiency]] which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with [[Hypertonic saline#Hypertonic saline|hypertonic saline solutions]] or [[vasopressin receptor antagonist]]s.<ref name=Klubo/> For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], particularly if the level of consciousness is too low to be able to safely swallow medication.<ref name=Klubo/> While administration through a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] is possible, this may be unsafe and is discouraged.<ref name=Klubo/>

===Pregnancy===
In women with known [[Thyroid disease in pregnancy|hypothyroidism who become pregnant]], it is recommended that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5&nbsp;mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0&nbsp;mIU/L.<ref name=Khandelwal2012/><ref name=Stagnaro/> Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the [[Thyroid function tests#Free thyroxine index|free T<sub>4</sub> index]].

==History==
In 1811, [[Bernard Courtois]] discovered iodine was present in [[seaweed]], and iodine intake was linked with [[goitre]] size in 1820 by [[Jean-Francois Coindet]].<ref name=Leung>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung AM, Braverman LE, Pearce EN | title = History of U.S. iodine fortification and supplementation | journal = Nutrients | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = 1740–6 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23201844 | pmc = 3509517 | doi = 10.3390/nu4111740 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Gaspard Adolphe Chatin]] proposed in 1852 that endemic goitre was the result of not enough iodine intake, and [[Eugen Baumann]] demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896.<ref name=Leung/>

The first cases of myxedema were recognized in the mid-19th century (the 1870s), but its connection to the thyroid was not discovered until the 1880s when myxedema was observed in people following the removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy).<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />  The link was further confirmed in the late 19th century when people and animals who had had their thyroid removed showed improvement in symptoms with transplantation of animal thyroid tissue.<ref name=Chakera/>  The severity of myxedema, and its associated risk of mortality and complications, created interest in discovering effective treatments for hypothyroidism.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals>{{cite journal | vauthors = McAninch EA, Bianco AC | title = The History and Future of Treatment of Hypothyroidism | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 164 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–6 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26747302 | pmc = 4980994 | doi = 10.7326/M15-1799 }}</ref>  Transplantation of thyroid tissue demonstrated some efficacy, but recurrences of hypothyroidism was relatively common, and sometimes required multiple repeat transplantations of thyroid tissue.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />

In 1891, the English physician [[George Redmayne Murray]] introduced subcutaneously injected sheep thyroid extract,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray GR | title = Note on the Treatment of Myxoedema by Hypodermic Injections of an Extract of the Thyroid Gland of a Sheep | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 1606 | pages = 796–7 | date = October 1891 | pmid = 20753415 | pmc = 2273741 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.1606.796 }}</ref> followed shortly after by an oral formulation.<ref name=Chakera/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox EL | title = A Case of Myxoedema Treated by Taking Extract of Thyroid by the Mouth | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 1661 | pages = 941 | date = October 1892 | pmid = 20753901 | pmc = 2421284 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.1661.941 }}</ref>  Purified thyroxine was introduced in 1914 and in the 1930s synthetic thyroxine became available, although desiccated animal thyroid extract remained widely used.  Liothyronine was identified in 1952.<ref name=Chakera/>

Early attempts at titrating therapy for hypothyroidism proved difficult.  After hypothyroidism was found to cause a lower [[basal metabolic rate]], this was used as a marker to guide adjustments in therapy in the early 20th century (around 1915).<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />  However, a low basal metabolic rate was known to be non-specific, also present in malnutrition.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />  The first laboratory test to be helpful in assessing thyroid status was the serum protein-bound iodine, which came into use around the 1950s.

In 1971, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) radioimmunoassay was developed, which was the most specific marker for assessing thyroid status in patients.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />  Many people who were being treated based on basal metabolic rate, minimizing hypothyroid symptoms, or based on serum protein-bound iodine, were found to have excessive thyroid hormone.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />  The following year, in 1972, a T<sub>3</sub> radioimmunoassay was developed, and in 1974, a T<sub>4</sub> radioimmunoassay was developed.<ref name=HxofHypoAnnals />

In veterinary practice, dogs are the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The majority of cases occur as a result of primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue.<ref name=Merck/><ref name=Mooney>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mooney CT | title = Canine hypothyroidism: a review of aetiology and diagnosis | journal = New Zealand Veterinary Journal | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 105–14 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21541883 | doi = 10.1080/00480169.2011.563729 | s2cid = 29535272 }}</ref> There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, as well as a number of other symptoms.<ref name=Mooney/> The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered.<ref name=Merck/> The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis.<ref name=Merck/><ref name=Mooney/> Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable [[Anti-thyroid autoantibodies|antibodies against thyroglobulin]], although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease.<ref name=Mooney/> Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.<ref name=Merck/>

Other species that are less commonly affected include cats and horses, as well as other large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in [[Western Canada]] and has been linked with the mother's diet.<ref name=Merck/>
