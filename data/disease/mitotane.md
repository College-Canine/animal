==Medical uses==
Mitotane has been produced by [[Bristol Myers Squibb]] but it is marketed as an [[orphan drug]] for adrenocortical carcinoma due to the small number of patients in need of it. Its main use is in those patients who have persistent disease despite surgical resection, those who are not surgical candidates, or those who have metastatic disease. In a 2007 retrospective study of 177 patients from 1985 to 2005 showed a significant increase in the recurrence-free interval after radical surgery followed by mitotane when compared to surgery alone.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Terzolo M, Angeli A, Fassnacht M, Daffara F, Tauchmanova L, Conton PA, Rossetto R, Buci L, Sperone P, Grossrubatscher E, Reimondo G, Bollito E, Papotti M, Saeger W, Hahner S, Koschker AC, Arvat E, Ambrosi B, Loli P, Lombardi G, Mannelli M, Bruzzi P, Mantero F, Allolio B, Dogliotti L, Berruti A | display-authors = 6 | title = Adjuvant mitotane treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 23 | pages = 2372–2380 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17554118 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa063360 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 2318/37317 }}</ref> The drug is also sometimes used in the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]].<ref name="Bronstein2010" />

==Side effects==
The use of mitotane is unfortunately limited by [[side effect]]s,<ref name="HarrisBouloux2014" /> which, as reported by Schteinberg et al., include [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[nausea]] (88%), [[diarrhea]] (38%), [[vomiting]]  (23%), decreased [[memory]] and ability to concentrate (50%), [[rash]] (23%), [[gynecomastia]] (50%), [[arthralgia]] (19%), and [[leukopenia]] (7%).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schteingart DE, Motazedi A, Noonan RA, Thompson NW | title = Treatment of adrenal carcinomas | journal = Archives of Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1142–1146 | date = September 1982 | pmid = 7115060 | doi = 10.1001/archsurg.1982.01380330010004 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Mitotane is an inhibitor of the [[adrenal cortex]]. It acts as an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]] (P450scc, CYP11A1), and also of [[11β-hydroxylase]] (CYP11B1), [[18-hydroxylase]] (aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2), and [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3β-HSD) to a lesser extent.<ref name="JamesonGroot2010" /><ref name="HarrisBouloux2014">{{cite book| vauthors = Tzanela M, Vassiliadi DA, Tsagarakis S | chapter = Coincidental adrenal masses and adrenal cancer| veditors = Harris PE, Bouloux PM |title=Endocrinology in Clinical Practice | edition = Second | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tZE-AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA216 |date=24 March 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-84184-951-5|pages=216–}}</ref> In addition, mitotane has direct and selective [[cytotoxic]] effects on the adrenal cortex, via an unknown mechanism, and thereby induces permanent [[Adrenal insufficiency|adrenal atrophy]] similarly to DDD.<ref name="MPHMD2011">{{cite book| vauthors = Sojka WS, Raizer J| chapter = Neurologic Complications of Hormonal Chemotherapies | veditors = Lee EQ, Schiff D, Wen PY |title=Neurologic Complications of Cancer Therapy| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52qyu5XPqM4C&pg=PA179 |date=28 September 2011|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|isbn=978-1-61705-019-0|pages=179–}}</ref><ref name="Kannan2012">{{cite book | vauthors = Kannan CR | chapter = Cushing's Syndrome |title=The Adrenal Gland| chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WqXSBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA160|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-1001-3|pages=160–}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
[[Structural analog|Analogue]]s of mitotane include [[aminoglutethimide]], [[amphenone B]], and [[metyrapone]].

==History==
Mitotane was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of [[adrenocortical carcinoma]].<ref name="Bronstein2010" />

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
Mitotane is the [[generic term|generic name]] of the medication and its {{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name}}, {{abbrlink|USAN|United States Adopted Name}}, {{abbrlink|BAN|British Approved Name}}, and {{abbrlink|JAN|Japanese Accepted Name}}.<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000">{{cite book|title=Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA697|year=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=697–}}</ref>

===Brand names===
Mitotane is sold under the brand name Lysodren.<ref name="Elks2014" />

==Veterinary use==
Mitotane is also used to treat [[Cushing's disease]] ([[pituitary]]-dependent [[Cushing's syndrome]]) in [[dog]]s. The medication is used in the controlled destruction of adrenal tissue, leading to a decrease in cortisol production.<ref>{{cite web|archive-date=2007-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021093745/http://www.michvma.org/documents/MVC%20Proceedings/Nichols2.pdf|title=Canine Cushing's Syndrome: Diagnosis and Treatment Part 1: Typical, Atypical, and Pseudo-Cushing's Disease|url=http://www.michvma.org/documents/MVC%20Proceedings/Nichols2.pdf|vauthors=Nichols R}}</ref>
