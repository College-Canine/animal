'''Maltese dog''' refers both to an ancient variety of dwarf, white-coated dog breed from [[Italy]]{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} and generally associated also with the island of [[Malta]], and to a modern [[dog breed|breed]] of similar dogs in the [[toy group]], genetically related to the [[Bichon]], [[Bolognese dog|Bolognese]], and [[Havanese dog|Havanese]] breeds.{{sfn|Gorman|2021}} The precise link, if any, between the modern and ancient species is not known. Nicholas Cutillo suggested that Maltese dogs might descend from [[Spitz|spitz-type canines]], and that the ancient variety probably was similar to the latter [[Pomeranian dog|Pomeranian breeds]] with their short snout, pricked ears, and bulbous heads.{{sfn|Cutillo|1986|pp=190,199}}{{sfn|MacKinnon|Belanger|2006|p=43}} These two varieties, according to [[Stanley Coren]], were perhaps the first dogs employed as human companions.{{sfn|Coren|2006|p=167}}

The modern variety traditionally has a silky, pure-white coat, hanging ears and a tail that curves over its back, and weighs up to {{convert|3|–|4|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} The Maltese does not shed.{{sfn|Alderton|2010|p=59}} The Maltese is kept for [[companion dog|companionship]], ornament, or [[Dog show|competitive exhibition]].

== Maltese dogs in antiquity ==
The old variety of Maltese appears to have been the most common or favourite pet, or certainly household dog, in antiquity.{{efn|"small dogs were also kept as household pets. The commonest of these seems to be an animal resembling the Maltese, an animal with small upright ears and long hair." {{harv|Trantalidou|2006|p=107}}}}{{efn|"the favourite pet dog of antiquity seems to have been the Maltese." {{harv|Gosling|1935|p=100}}}}{{efn|"The commonest pet was the small white long-coated Maltese dog represented on 5th-cent. BC Attic vases and gravestones." {{harv|White|Hornblower|2012|p=1118}}}} Dogs of various sizes and shapes are depicted on vases and [[amphora]]e.{{sfn|Moore|2008|p=16}} On one Attic amphora from about 500&nbsp;BC, excavated at [[Vulci]] in the nineteenth century and now lost, an illustration of a small dog with a pointed muzzle is accompanied by the word μελιταῖε, ''melitaie''.{{sfn|Johnson|1919|p=211}}

Numerous references to these dogs are found in Ancient Greek and Roman literature.{{sfn|Busuttil|1969|pp=205–208}} Ancient writers variously attribute its origin either to the island of [[Malta]] in the Mediterranean, called {{lang|la|Melita}} in Latin, – a name which derives from the Carthaginian city of that name on the island, [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]] – or to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] island of [[Mljet]], near [[Corfu]] and off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast of modern [[Croatia]], also called Melita in Latin. The uncertainty continues, but recent scholarship generally supports the identification with Malta.{{sfn|Ogden|2007|p=197}}

In Greece in [[classical era|the classical period]] a variety of diminutive dog (νανούδιον/''nanoúdion'' -"dwarf dog"){{sfn|Busuttil|1969|p=205}}  was called a Μελιταῖον κυνίδιον (''Melitaion kunídion'', "small dog from Melita"). In its unusual smallness it was variously likened to [[marten]]s (ἴκτις/''iktis'') or [[pangolin]]s.{{efn|[[Claudius Aelian|Aelian]] in his treatise on animals (''De Natura Animalium'', 16:6) drew the latter comparison {{harv|Busuttil|1969|p=205}}.}}  The word "Melita" in this adjectival form, attested in [[Aristotle]],{{efn|[[Aristotle]], [[History of Animals|Hist Anim.ix]] 6,612<sup>b</sup>10}} refers to the island of Malta, according to Busuttil.{{sfn|Busuttil|1969|p=205}}{{efn|This lexical argument – that Μελιταῖος/''Melitaîos''is the proper adjective for Melite/Malta, whereas the adjective for Melite/Mljet must have been Μελιτήνος/''Melitēnos'' has been challenged by the Maltese scholar Horatio Vella, who cites the adjectival form ''Melitēíos'' as an attested dialect form of ''Melitaîos'' defining a mountain in the Adriatic area near Corcyra ({{lang|grc|αἱ δ᾽ὄρεος κορυφὰς Μελιτηίου ἀμφενέμοντο}}: "others dwelt about the peaks of the Meliteian mountain") from the [[Argonautica]] (4.1150) of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].{{sfn|Vella|1995|p=12}}}}  The [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic philosopher]] [[Diogenes|Diogenes of Sinope]], Aristotle's contemporary, according to the testimony of [[Diogenes Laertius]], referred to himself as a "Maltese dog" (κύων.. Μελιταῖος/''kúōn Melitaios'').{{sfn|Ogden|2007|p=200}} A traditional story in [[Aesop's Fables]] contrasts the spoiling of a Maltese by his owner, compared to life of the toilsome neglect suffered by the master's [[donkey|ass]]. Envious of the spoiling attentions lavished on the pup, the ass tries to frolic and be winsome also, in order to enter his master's graces and be treated kindly, only to be beaten off and tethered to its manger.{{sfn|Busuttil|1969|p=205}}{{efn|Ὄνος καὶ κυνίδιον 275:Ἔχων τις κύνα Μελιταῖον καὶ ὄνον διετέλει ἀεὶ τῷ κυνὶ προσπαίζων· καὶ δή, εἴ ποτε ἔξω ἐδείπνει, διεκόμιζέ τι αὐτῷ, καὶ προσιόντι καὶ σαίνοντι παρέβαλλεν. Ὁ δὲ ὄνος φθονήσας προσέδραμε καὶ σκιρτῶν ἐλάκτιζεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ὃς ἀγανακτήσας ἐκέλευσε παίοντας αὐτὸν ἀπαγαγεῖν καὶ τῇ φάτνῃ προσδῆσαι {{harv|Aesop|1980|pp=304–305}}.}}

Around 280&nbsp;BCE,{{sfn|Jebb|1909|p=67,n.36}}  the learned [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic poet]] [[Callimachus]], according to [[Pliny the Elder]] writing in the Ist century CE, identified Melite – the home of this ancient dog variety – as the Adriatic island, rather than Malta.{{efn|{{lang|la|"inter quam et Illyricum Melite, unde catulos Melitaeos appellari Callimachus auctor est"}}: "(between Corcyra Melaena) and Illyricum is Meleda, from which according to Callimachus Maltese terriers get their name".{{sfn|Pliny|1942|p=114}}{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1949|p=404}}}} Conversely, the poem ''Alexandra'' ascribed to his equally erudite contemporary [[Lycophron]], which is now thought to have been composed around 190&nbsp;BCE, also alludes to the island of Melite, but identified it as Malta.{{efn|"The identity of this island called Melite has been much discussed, but the evident proximity to Cape Pachynos, the southern promontory of Sicily, clearly indicates Malta." {{harv|Hornblower|2015|p=375}}}}{{efn|<poem>{{lang|grc|ἄλλοι δὲ Μελίτην νῆσον Ὀθρωνοῦ πέλας

ἐπώνυμόν ποθ᾽ ὑστέρῳ χρόνῳ γράφων
κλεινόν θ᾽ ἵδρυμα παρθένου Λογγάτιδος,
Ἕλωρος ἔνθα ψυχρὸν ἐκβάλλει ποτόν,}}</poem> "Other wanderers shall dwell in the isle of Melita near Othronus, round which the Sicanian wave laps beside Pachynus, grazing the steep promontory that in after time shall bear the name of the son of Sisyphus, and the famous shrine of the maiden Longatis, where Helorus empties his chilly stream." {{harv|Lycophron|1921|pp=406–407}}.}}{{efn|This confusion between Malta and Mljet also recurs in ancient references to the site of the shipwreck of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] recounted in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].}} [[Strabo]], writing in the early first century AD, attributed its origin to the island of Malta.{{efn|{{lang|grc|πρόκειται δὲ τοῦ Παχύνου Μελίτη, ὅθεν τὰ κυνίδια ἃ καλοῦσι Μελιταῖα καὶ Γαῦδος, ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ ὀκτὼ μίλια τῆς ἄκρας ἀμφότεραι διέχουσαι}}: "Off [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]] lies Melita, whence come the little dogs called Melitaean, and Gaudos, both eighty-eight miles distant from the Cape."{{sfn|Strabo|1924|pp=102–103}}}}

Aristotle's successor [[Theophrastus]] (371 – c. 287&nbsp;BC), in his sketch of moral types, ''Characters'', has a chapter on a [[Character (arts)|type of person]] who exercises a petty pride in pursuing a showy ambition to be particularly fastidious in his taste (Μικροφιλοτιμία/''mikrophilotimía'').  One feature he identifies with this character type is that if his pet dog dies he will erect a memorial slab commemorating his "scion of Melita."{{efn|{{lang|grc|καὶ κυναρίου δὲ Μελιταίου τελευτήσαντος αὐτῷ μνῆμα ποιῆσαι καὶ στηλίδιον ποιήσας [10] ἐπιγράψαι ΚΛΑΔΟΣ ΜΕΛΙΤΑΙΟΣ}}: "Or if his little Melitean dog has died, he will put up a little memorial slab, with the inscription, a scion of Melita." [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Jebb]], or his posthumous editor, [[John Edwin Sandys|Sandys]], argued that the reference was to the Illyrian Melita, rather than Malta.{{sfn|Jebb|1909|pp=66–67,n.36}}}}  [[Athenaeus]], in his voluminous early 3rd century CE [[Deipnosophistae]] (12:518–519), states that it was a characteristic of the Sicilian [[Sybaris|Sybarites]], notorious for the extreme punctiliousness of their refined tastes, to delight in the company of owl-faced jester-dwarfs and Melite lap-dogs (rather than in their fellow human beings), with the latter accompanying them even when they went to exercise in the gymnasia.{{efn|{{lang|grc|καὶ κυνάρια Μελιταῖα, ἅπερ αὐτοῖς καὶ ἕπεσθαι εἰς τὰ γυμνάσια; οἱ Συβαρῖται ἔχαιρον τοῖς Μελιταίοις κυνιδίοις καὶ ἀνθρώποις οὐκ ἀνθρώποις}}: "also Melitê lap-dogs. Which accompany them even to the gymnasia..The Sybarites, on the contrary, took delight in Melitê puppies and human beings who were less than human."{{sfn|Athenaeus|1980|pp=334–335, 336–337}}}}

The Romans called them {{lang|la|catuli melitaei}}. During the first century, the Roman poet [[Martial]] wrote descriptive verses to a [[lap dog]] named "Issa" owned by his friend Publius.{{sfn|Serpell|1996|p=47}}{{sfn|Franco|2019|pp=100–101}}{{efn|{{harv|Gosling|1935|pp=110–111}}:<poem>Issa's more full of sport and wanton play
Than that pet sparrow by Catullus sung;
Issa's more pure and cleanly in her way
Than kisses from the amorous turtle's tongue,
Issa more winsome is than any girl
That ever yet entranced a lover's sight;
Issa's more precious than the Indian pearl
Issa's my Publius' favourite and delight.
Her plaintive voice falls sad as one that weeps;
Her master's cares and woes alike she shares;
Softly reclined upon his neck she sleeps,
And scarce to sigh or draw her breath she dares.
Her, lest the day of fate should nothing leave,
In pictured form my Publius has portrayed
Where you so lifelike Issa might perceive.
That not herself a better likeness made,
Issa together with her portrait lay,
Both real or both depicted you would say.
</poem>}} It has been claimed that Issa was a Maltese dog, and that various sources link this Publius with the [[Saint Publius|Roman Governor Publius of Malta]],{{sfn|Blarney|Inglee|1949|p=622}}  but nothing is known of this Publius, other than that he was an unidentified friend of Paulus, a member of Martial's literary circle.{{sfn|Vioque|2017|p=410}}

==The Maltese in modern times==
Dog [[genome|genomic experts]] state that despite the rich history of the ancient breed, the modern Maltese, like many other breeds, cannot be linked by pedigree to that ancient genealogy, but, rather, emerged in the Victorian era by regulating the crossing of existing varieties of dog to produce a type that could be registered as a distinct breed. The Maltese and similar breeds such as the Havanese, Bichon and Bolognese, are indeed related, perhaps through a common ancestor resulting from a severe [[Population bottleneck|bottleneck]] when a handful of petite canine varieties began to be selected for mating around two centuries ago.{{sfn|Gorman|2021}}

In his work {{lang|la|Insulae Melitae Descriptio}}, the first history of its kind,{{sfn|Delgado|2020|pp=16–17}} [[Abbé]] [[Jean Quintin]], Secretary to the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], wrote in 1536 that, while classical authors wrote of Maltese dogs, which perhaps might formerly have been born there, the local Maltese people of his time were no longer familiar with the species.{{efn|{{lang|la|"Huic insulae Strabo nobiles illos, adagio, non minus quam medicinis, canes adscribit, inde Melitaeos dictos, Plinio, & nunc  etiam incolis ignotos, tunc forte nascebantur."}}{{sfn|Quintin|1536|p=24}}}}

[[John Caius]], physician to [[Queen Elizabeth I]], writing of women's chamber pets, {{lang|la|canes delicati}}  such as the ''Comforter'' or ''Spanish Gentle,'' stated that they were known as "Melitei" hailing from Malta,{{sfn|Lytton|1911|pp=25–27}} though the species he describes were actually [[Spaniel]]s,{{sfn|Drury|1903|p=577}}{{sfn|Leighton|1910|p=274}} perhaps of the recently imported [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel|King Charles Spaniel]] type. A variation of the latter was the [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]] toy dog, bred by the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Marlborough family]], with its distinctive white and chestnut mantle.{{sfn|Welsh|1882|p=238}} Red and white mantled varieties of these toy pets, the King Charles or [[Oxfordshire]] Blenheim breeds, were all the fashion in the 17th.century, down through the early decades of the 19th.century.{{sfn|Welsh|1882|p=238}}

In 1837 [[Edwin Landseer]] painted ''The Lion Dog from Malta: The Last of his Tribe'', a portrait of a dog named Quiz, a petite flossy white creature poised next to a huge [[Newfoundland dog]], commissioned by [[Queen Victoria]] as a birthday present for her mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], whose dog it was.{{sfn|Lee|1899|p=345}}{{sfn|Stephens|1874|p=105}} According to [[John Henry Welsh]], shortly after Landseer's canvases, the London ''fancy'' of toy dog enthusiasts took to importing exemplars of the Chinese spaniel, with their short faces and snub noses, and crossbred these with [[pug]]s and [[bulldog]]s to select for puppies with a longer "feather" or fleecing on their ears and limbs.{{sfn|Welsh|1882|p=239}} Some time later, the London market began to deal in what were called "Maltese" dogs. These had no known connection to that island, and one of the breeders, T. V. H. Lukey, associated with the [[English mastiff]], stated that his own Maltese strain was imported from [[Philippines|the Manilla Islands]] in 1841.{{sfn|Welsh|1882|p=241}}

A strain of this type was accepted as a distinct class at the [[Business Design Centre|Agricultural Hall Show]] in [[Islington]] in 1862, when a breeder, R. Mandeville, took first prize and continued to do so in subsequent years.{{sfn|Welsh|1882|pp=241–242}} From 1869 to 1879, Mandeville swept the board of most shows in [[Birmingham]], Islington, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]], and his kennels were considered to have furnished the finest strain for subsequent Maltese breeding.{{sfn|Various|2010}} From the 19th. century onwards, the requirement emerged for the Maltese to have an exclusively white coat.{{sfn|Raymond-Mallock|1907|p=63}} Despite the unknown provenance, by the close of the century, the dog-expert William Drury noted that nearly all English writers of that period associated the breed with Malta, without adducing any evidence for the claim.{{sfn|Drury|1903|p=577}}

A white dog was shown as a "Maltese Lion Dog" at the first [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in [[New York City]] in 1877.{{sfn|Brearley|1984|p=29}} From that time they were occasionally crossed with poodles, and a stud book, based on the issue of two females, was established in 1901. By the 1950s, this registry counted roughly 50 dogs in its pedigree table.{{sfn|Gorman|2021}} The Maltese was recognised as a breed by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1888.{{sfn|AKC|2022}} It was definitively accepted by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] under the [[patronage]] of Italy in 1955.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}}

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Lucy McElhiney.jpg|thumb|Maltese showing tear staining]]
The [[coat (dog)|coat]] is dense, glossy, silky and shiny, falling heavily along the body without curls or an [[down hair|undercoat]].{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} The colour is pure white, however a pale ivory tinge or light brown spotting is permitted.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} Adult weight is usually {{convert|3|–|4|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} Females are about {{convert|20|–|23|cm|abbr=on|0}} tall, males slightly more.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}} They behave in a lively, calm, and affectionate manner.{{sfn|AISBL|2015}}
The Maltese does not shed.{{sfn|Alderton|2010|p=59}} Like other white dogs, they may show tear-stains.{{sfn|Leighton|1910|p=297}}{{sfn|Fielheller}}

In addition, the breed may be prone to certain health conditions. Namely, liver issues, heart issues (e.g., "Patent Ductus Arteriosus"), and joint issues may be common.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maltese |url=https://www.petmd.com/dog/breeds/maltese |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=www.petmd.com |language=en}}</ref>

Of note, the breed is also highly recommended for those with dog allergies. This is as the breed is considered hypoallergenic; hence, those with dog allergies may be able to tolerate them. Specifically, some people with dog allergies may be able to tolerate living with a Maltese as they shed less fur.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Facts About Maltese Dogs {{!}} ASPCA Pet Health Insurance |url=https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/facts-about-maltese-dogs/ |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=www.aspcapetinsurance.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=December 7, 2023 |first=Gemma |last=Johnstone |title=Does a Completely Hypoallergenic Dog Exist? |url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/do-hypoallergenic-dog-exist/ |access-date=2023-12-30 |website=American Kennel Club |language=en}}</ref>

== Use ==
The Maltese is kept for [[companion dog|companionship]], for ornament, or for [[Dog show|competitive exhibition]].{{sfn|MSAKC|2022}} It is ranked 59th of 79 breeds assessed for intelligence by [[Stanley Coren]].{{sfn|Coren|2006|p=124}}
