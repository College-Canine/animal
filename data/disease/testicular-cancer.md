==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Testicular cancer.jpg|thumb|Image showing the first sign of testicular cancer]]
One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 2011 |title=Testicular Cancer: Screening |url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/testicular-cancer-screening |access-date=3 August 2020 |website=uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org |publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]}}</ref> However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they have a family history of cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 January 2011 |title=Can testicular cancer be found early? |url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-detection |access-date=4 December 2011 |website=Testicular Cancer: Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |archive-date=21 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121112821/http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-detection |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Testicular Self-Examination (TSE) |url=http://www.urologyhealth.org/urology/index.cfm?article=101 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917002020/http://www.urologyhealth.org/urology/index.cfm?article=101 |archive-date=17 September 2014 |access-date=13 February 2013 |publisher=[[American Urological Association]]}}</ref>

Symptoms may also include one or more of the following:

* sharp pain or a dull ache in the lower [[abdomen]] or scrotum<ref name="afp2008" />
* a feeling often described as "heaviness" in the scrotum<ref name="afp2008" />
* firmness of the testicle<ref name="afp2008" />
* breast enlargement ([[gynecomastia]]) from hormonal effects of β-hCG<ref name="harrison16th" /><ref name="afp2008" />
* [[low back pain]] (lumbago) due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes along the back<ref name="harrison16th" /><ref name="afp2008" />

It is not very common for testicular cancer to spread to other organs, apart from the lungs. If it has, however, the following symptoms may be present:
* shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[cough]] or coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]) from metastatic spread to the lungs<ref name="harrison16th" /><ref name="afp2008" />
* a lump in the neck due to metastases to the lymph nodes<ref name="harrison16th" /><ref name="afp2008" />

Testicular cancer, [[cryptorchidism]], [[hypospadias]], and poor [[semen quality]] make up the syndrome known as [[testicular dysgenesis syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Skakkebaek |first1=N.

==Causes==
A major risk factor for the development of testis cancer is [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testicles).  It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism; when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large.  Other risk factors include [[inguinal hernia]]s, [[Klinefelter syndrome]], and<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Forman |first1=D |last2=M C Pike |last3=G Davey |last4=S Dawson |last5=K Baker |last6=C E D Chilvers |last7=R T D Oliver |last8=C A C Coupland |date=28 May 1994 |title=Aetiology of testicular cancer: association with congenital abnormalities, age at puberty, infertility, and exercise.

Early onset of male characteristics is associated with increased risk.  These may reflect endogenous or environmental [[hormone]]s. {{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Higher rates of testicular cancer in Western nations have been linked to the use of cannabis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Daling |first1=Janet |last2=Swartz |first2=Stephen |date=15 March 2009 |title=Marijuana Use Linked To Increased Risk Of Testicular Cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=1215–23 |doi=10.1002/cncr.24159 |pmc=2759698 |pmid=19204904}}</ref><ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/138372.php Testicular Cancer Risk Linked To Marijuana Smoking ] Medical News Today 2 September 2009.</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cannabis-linked-to-testicular-cancer-1604487.html Cannabis linked to testicular cancer ].

==Mechanisms==
Most testicular germ cell tumors have too many [[chromosomes]], and most often they are [[triploid]] to [[tetraploid]]. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both sides of the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Atkin NB, Baker MC |date=December 1982 |title=Specific chromosome change, i(12p), in testicular tumours? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8311 |page=1349 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(82)91557-4 |pmid=6128640 |s2cid=188534}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Seminoma.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] (high magnification) of a [[seminoma]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
The main way testicular cancer is diagnosed is via a lump or mass inside a testis. More generally, if a young adult or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, which may or may not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect testicular cancer.

Other conditions may also have symptoms similar to testicular cancer:<ref>{{cite web |title=Testicular Cancer - Symptoms, Causes, Treatment {{!}} NORD |url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/testicular-cancer/ |website=rarediseases.org |access-date=26 June 2023}}</ref>

* [[Epididymitis]] or [[Epididymitis|epididymo-orchitis]]
* [[Hematocele]]
* [[Varicocele]]
* [[Orchitis]]
* Prostate infections or inflammations ([[prostatitis]]), bladder infections or inflammations ([[cystitis]]), or kidney (renal) infections ([[nephritis]]) or inflammations which have spread to and caused swelling in the vessels of the testicles or scrotum
* [[Testicular torsion]] or a [[hernia]]
* Infection, inflammation, retro-[[peritonitis]], or other conditions of the lymph nodes or vessels near the scrotum, testicles, pubis, anorectal area, and groin
* Benign tumors or lesions of the testicles
* Metastasis to the testicles from another, primary tumor site(s)

The nature of any palpated lump in the [[scrotum]] is often evaluated by scrotal [[ultrasound]], which can determine exact location, size, and some characteristics of the lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed, or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by [[CT scan]]s, which are used to locate [[metastasis|metastases]].

The [[differential diagnosis]] of testicular cancer requires examining the [[histology]] of tissue obtained from an [[inguinal orchiectomy]] - that is, surgical excision of the entire [[testis]] along with attached structures ([[epididymis]] and [[spermatic cord]]). A [[biopsy]] should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How is testicular cancer diagnosed |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html}}</ref>

Inguinal orchiectomy is the preferred method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links to the back of the abdominal cavity (the [[retroperitoneum]]).  A trans-scrotal biopsy or orchiectomy will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal orchiectomy, only the retroperitoneal route exists.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Blood tests are also used to identify and measure [[tumor marker]]s (usually [[protein]]s present in the bloodstream) that are specific to testicular cancer. [[Alpha-fetoprotein]], [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (the "pregnancy hormone"), and [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH-1]] are the typical tumor markers used to spot testicular germ cell tumors.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

A [[pregnancy test]] may be used to detect high levels of chorionic gonadotropin; however, the first sign of testicular cancer is usually a painless lump.<ref>{{Cite web |last=ABC News |title=Pregnancy Test, Used by a Man as Joke, Reveals Testicular Cancer - ABC News |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/CancerPreventionAndTreatment/pregnancy-test-man-joke-reveals-testicular-cancer/story?id=17653036 |website=ABC News}}</ref> Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated chorionic gonadotropin, so a pregnancy test is not very sensitive for making out testicular cancer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Serum tumor markers in testicular germ cell tumors |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors}}</ref>

=== Stressful Experiences Caregivers of Testicular Cancer Patients May Notice ===
The stressful event of testicular cancer not only affects the patient that is diagnosed but also affects the caregiver.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=UroToday - The Global Online Community of Urologists |url=https://www.urotoday.com/ |access-date=2024-04-19 |website=www.urotoday.com}}</ref> The psychological stress model consists of stressful experiences that a patient with testicular cancer may go through after diagnosis, that caregivers may want to look out for.<ref name=":0" /> The stressful experiences consist of 4 main categories:

* Late side-effects
* Fear of tumor relapse
* Fertility problems
* Social and workplace issues<ref name=":0" />

These side effects may need physical and emotional care which in turn can cause the caregiver an emotional burden.<ref name=":0" />

===Screening===
The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] recommends against screening males without symptoms for testicular cancer.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 February 2015 |title=American Academy of Family Physicians {{!}} Choosing Wisely |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-academy-of-family-physicians/ |access-date=14 August 2018 |website=www.choosingwisely.org}}</ref>

Then the testicular tumor is staged by a [[pathologist]] according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors as published in the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer|AJCC]] Cancer Staging Manual.  Testicular cancer is categorized as being in one of three [[Cancer staging|stages]] ([[TNM staging system|which have subclassifications]]).  The size of the tumor in the testis is irrelevant to staging.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSPart1Manual.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011104151/http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSPart1Manual.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2006 |access-date=2006-11-16 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In broad terms, testicular cancer is staged as follows:
* Stage I: the cancer remains localized to the [[testis]].
* Stage II: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] to [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and/or [[paraaortic lymph node]]s ([[lymph node]]s below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]).
* Stage III: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] beyond the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and [[paraaortic lymph node]]s.  Stage 3 is further subdivided into non-bulky stage 3 and bulky stage 3.<ref name="titleTesticular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page">{{Cite web |title=Testicular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page |url=http://tcrc.acor.org/staging.html |access-date=13 December 2007}}</ref>

Although testicular cancer can be derived from any cell type found in the testicles, more than 95% of testicular cancers are [[germ cell tumor]]s (GCTs).  Most of the remaining 5% are [[sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour]]s derived from [[Leydig cell]]s or [[Sertoli cell]]s.  Correct diagnosis is necessary to ensure the most effective and appropriate treatment.  To some extent, this can be done via blood tests for [[tumor marker]]s, but definitive diagnosis requires examination of the [[histology]] of a specimen by a [[pathologist]]. Testicular tumors are best classified by radical inguinal orchiectomy, which allows for both histologic evaluation of the whole testicle and provides local tumor control.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Koschel |first1=Samantha G. |last2=Wong |first2=Lih-Ming |date=9 December 2020 |title=Radical inguinal orchidectomy: the gold standard for initial management of testicular cancer |journal=Translational Andrology and Urology |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=3094–3102 |doi=10.21037/tau.2019.12.20 |issn=2223-4691 |pmc=7807348 |pmid=33457282 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Treatment==
The three basic types of treatment are [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 January 2009 |title=Testicular Cancer Treatment (PDQ) |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/testicular/HealthProfessional/page8 |access-date=13 February 2009 |website=National Cancer Institute}}</ref>

Surgery is performed by [[urologist]]s; radiation therapy is administered by [[radiation oncologist]]s; and chemotherapy is the work of medical [[oncologist]]s. In most patients with testicular cancer, the disease is cured readily with minimal long-term [[morbidity]]. While treatment success depends on the stage, the average survival rate after five years is around 95%, and stage 1 cancer cases, if monitored properly, have essentially a 100% survival rate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Testicular Cancer Survival Rates |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html |access-date=2018-01-18 |website=www.cancer.org}}</ref>

=== Testicle removal ===
The initial treatment for testicular cancer is surgery to remove the affected testicle ([[orchiectomy]]). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Since only one testis is typically required to maintain fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the affected testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called [[inguinal orchiectomy]]. (The testicle is almost never removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.)  In the UK, the procedure is known as a radical orchidectomy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Removing a testicle (orchidectomy) for testicular cancer |url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/testicular-cancer/treatment/surgery/removing-testicle |website=www.cancerresearchuk.org |access-date=4 July 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

===Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection===
In the case of [[nonseminoma|non-seminoma]]s that appear to be stage I, surgery may be done on the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]]/[[Paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]] [[lymph node]]s (in a separate operation) to accurately determine whether the cancer is in stage I or stage II and to reduce the risk that [[malignant]] testicular cancer cells that may have [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen.  This surgery is called [[retroperitoneal lymph node dissection]] (RPLND).  However, this approach, while standard in many places, especially the United States, is out of favor due to costs and the high level of expertise required to perform successful surgery. Sperm banking is frequently carried out prior to the procedure (as with chemotherapy), as there is a risk that RPLND may damage the nerves involved in ejaculation, causing ejaculation to occur internally into the bladder rather than externally.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Daniel H. |title=Sperm banking and the cancer patient |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Urology |date=February 2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |doi=10.1177/1756287210368279 |pmid=21789080 |pmc=3126065 }}</ref>

Many patients are instead choosing surveillance, where no further surgery is performed unless tests indicate that the cancer has returned. This approach maintains a high cure rate because of the growing accuracy of surveillance techniques.

=== Adjuvant treatment ===
Since testicular cancers can spread, patients are usually offered [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant treatment]] - in the form of [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]] - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the [[histology]] of the tumor (i.e., the size and shape of its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e., how far cells have 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic [[CT scans]] and blood tests, in place of adjuvant treatment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Al-Salem |first1=Ahmed H. |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44182-5 |title=An Illustrated Guide to Pediatric Urology |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319441825 |page=585 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-44182-5 |access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>

Before 1970, survival rates from testicular cancer were low. Since the introduction of [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant chemotherapy]], chiefly platinum-based drugs like [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.

In the UK, a similar trend has emerged: since improvements in treatment, survival rates have risen rapidly to cure rates of over 95%.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 October 2009 |title=Testicular Cancer survival statistics |url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/survival/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224185202/http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/survival/ |archive-date=24 December 2011 |access-date=4 December 2011 |website=cancerresearchuk.org |publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]] |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Radiation therapy===
[[Radiation]] may be used to treat stage II seminoma cancers, or as [[adjuvant]] (preventative) therapy in the case of stage I seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic [[lymph nodes]]).  Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for [[nonseminoma|non-seminoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Francolini |first1=Giulio |last2=Trodella |first2=Luca Eolo |last3=Marvaso |first3=Giulia |last4=Matrone |first4=Fabio |last5=Nicosia |first5=Luca |last6=Timon |first6=Giorgia |last7=Ognibene |first7=Lucia |last8=Vinciguerra |first8=Annamaria |last9=Franzese |first9=Ciro |last10=Borghetti |first10=Paolo |last11=Arcangeli |first11=Stefano |title=Radiotherapy role in non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, radiobiological and technical issues of an unexplored scenario |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34273014/ |journal=International Journal of Clinical Oncology |date=October 2021 |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1777–1783 |doi=10.1007/s10147-021-01989-7 |pmid=34273014 |s2cid=235966834 |access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>

===Chemotherapy===

==== Non-seminoma ====

Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non-seminoma when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (that is, stage 2B or 3).  The standard [[chemotherapy protocol]] is three, or sometimes four, rounds of [[Bleomycin]]-[[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (BEP). BEP as a first-line treatment was first reported by Professor [[Michael Peckham]] in 1983.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Peckham |first1=MJ |last2=Barrett |first2=A |last3=Liew |first3=KH |last4=Horwich |first4=A |last5=Robinson |first5=B |last6=Dobbs |first6=HJ |last7=McElwain |first7=TJ |last8=Hendry |first8=WF |year=1983 |title=The treatment of metastatic germ-cell testicular tumours with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=613–619 |doi=10.1038/bjc.1983.99 |pmc=2011384 |pmid=6189504}}</ref> The landmark trial published in 1987 which established BEP as the optimum treatment was conducted by Dr. [[Lawrence Einhorn]] at [[Indiana University]].<ref name="Chemotherapy - BEP and EP">{{Cite web |title=Chemotherapy - BEP and EP |url=http://www.tc-library.com/chemotherapy-bep-and-ep/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226043603/http://www.tc-library.com/chemotherapy-bep-and-ep/ |archive-date=26 February 2014 |access-date=16 February 2009}}</ref> An alternative, equally effective treatment involves the use of four cycles of [[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (EP).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Reyhanoglu |first1=Gizem |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557864/ |title=Etoposide |last2=Tadi |first2=Prasanna |date=2022-07-11 |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |language=en |pmid=32491787}}</ref>

Lymph node surgery may also be performed after chemotherapy to remove masses left behind (stage 2B or more advanced), particularly in the cases of large [[nonseminoma|non-seminoma]]s.

==== Seminoma ====

As an [[adjuvant]] treatment, use of [[chemotherapy]] as an alternative to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.).  Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of [[carboplatin]], typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful [[adjuvant]] treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of [[radiotherapy]]. The concept of [[carboplatin]] as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 July 2005 |title=MRC trial shows single dose of drug is as effective as two weeks' radiotherapy for testicular cancer |url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC001863 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724184509/http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC001863 |archive-date=24 July 2009 |access-date=4 December 2011 |website=News and Publications |publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]}}</ref> However, very long-term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Since seminoma can recur decades after the primary tumor is removed, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy should remain vigilant and not assume they are cured 5 years after treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Felice |first1=Francesca |last2=Musio |first2=Daniela |last3=Gravina |first3=Giovanni Luca |last4=Marampon |first4=Francesco |last5=Tombolini |first5=Vincenzo |title=Adjuvant radiation therapy in stage I seminoma: 20 years of oncologic results |journal=Oncotarget |date=29 November 2016 |volume=7 |issue=48 |pages=80077–80082 |doi=10.18632/oncotarget.11374 |pmid=27556300 |pmc=5346772 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Treatment of testicular cancer is one of the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Huang |first=William C. |date=5 June 2008 |title=Book Review: Urological Oncology |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=358 |issue=23 |page=2527 |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev59744 |issn=1533-4406}}</ref> In 2011 overall cure rates of more than 95% were reported, and 80% for metastatic disease—the best response by any solid tumor, with improved survival being attributed primarily to effective chemotherapy.<ref name=JAMA2008/>  By 2013 more than 96 per cent of the 2,300 men diagnosed each year in the U.K. were deemed cured, a rise by almost a third since the 1970s, the improvement attributed substantially to the chemotherapy drug [[cisplatin]].<ref name="TheTimes20130729">{{Cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=29 July 2013 |title=Male cancer is almost beaten after chance find |work=The Times |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3828058.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729165213/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3828058.ece |archive-date=29 July 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the United States, when the disease is treated while it is still localized, more than 99% of people survive 5 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Testis Cancer |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/testis.html |access-date=18 March 2016 |website=National Cancer Institute}}</ref>

===Surveillance===
For many patients with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may not be appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Krege |first1=S. |last2=Beyer |first2=J. |last3=Souchon |first3=R. |last4=Albers |first4=P. |last5=Albrecht |first5=W. |last6=Algaba |first6=F. |last7=Bamberg |first7=Michael |last8=Bodrogi |first8=István |last9=Bokemeyer |first9=Carsten |year=2008 |title=European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ cell cancer: a report of the second meeting of the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus group (EGCCCG): part I |journal=European Urology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=478–496 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024 |pmid=18191324}}</ref> The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, will depend on the type of cancer ([[Nonseminoma|non-seminoma]] or [[seminoma]]), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the many patients who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with [[metastasis|metastases]] (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative "adjuvant" treatments, but the patients have to be prepared to follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

For both non-seminomas and seminomas, surveillance tests generally include physical examination, blood tests for tumor markers, chest x-rays, and [[CT Scan|CT scanning]].  However, the requirements of a surveillance program differ according to the type of disease since, for seminoma patients, relapses can occur later, and blood tests are not as good at indicating relapse.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

CT scans are performed on the abdomen (and sometimes the pelvis) and also the chest in some hospitals. Chest x-rays are increasingly preferred for the lungs as they give sufficient detail combined with a lower false-positive rate and significantly smaller radiation dose than CT.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Broder |first1=Joshua |title=Diagnostic Imaging for the Emergency Physician |chapter=Imaging the Chest |date=2011 |pages=185–296 |doi=10.1016/B978-1-4160-6113-7.10005-5|isbn=9781416061137 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The frequency of CT scans during surveillance should ensure that relapses are detected at an early stage while minimizing the radiation exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Safer Ways to Detect Testicular Cancer Recurrence - NCI |website=www.cancer.gov |date=19 April 2022 |url=https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/testicular-cancer-surgery-monitoring-mri-ct-scan |access-date=2 August 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

For patients treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, there have been no randomized trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A trial to find the best way of using scans to monitor men after treatment for seminoma testicular cancer (TRISST MRC TE24) |url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/trials/a-trial-to-find-the-best-way-of-using-scans-to-monitor-men-after-treatment-for-seminoma-testicular-cancer |access-date=4 December 2011 |website=CancerHelp UK |publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Would it be better to use MRI scans instead of CT scans to monitor men with early stage testicular cancer?

For more advanced stages of testicular cancer, and for those cases in which radiation therapy or chemotherapy was administered, the extent of monitoring (tests) after treatment will vary on the basis of the circumstances, but normally should be done for five years in uncomplicated cases and for longer in those with higher risks of relapse.

===Fertility===
A man with one remaining testis may maintain fertile.  However, sperm banking may be appropriate for men who still plan to have children, since fertility may be adversely affected by [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiotherapy]].  A man who [[castration|loses both testicles]] will be infertile after the procedure, though he may elect to bank viable, cancer-free sperm prior to the procedure.

== Psychological Factors of Testicular Cancer ==
Although testicular cancer has a low mortality rate and better prognosis outcomes, psychological factors still affect cancer patients struggling with a diagnosis.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Rincones |first1=Orlando |last2=Smith |first2=Allan 'Ben' |last3=Naher |first3=Sayeda |last4=Mercieca-Bebber |first4=Rebecca |last5=Stockler |first5=Martin |date=May 2021 |title=An Updated Systematic Review of Quantitative Studies Assessing Anxiety, Depression, Fear of Cancer Recurrence or Psychological Distress in Testicular Cancer Survivors |url=https://www.dovepress.com/an-updated-systematic-review-of-quantitative-studies-assessing-anxiety-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CMAR |journal=Cancer Management and Research |language=en |volume=13 |pages=3803–3816 |doi=10.2147/CMAR.S198039 |doi-access=free |pmid=34007213 |issn=1179-1322|pmc=8123967 }}</ref>  This means that the absence of testicles can influence perceptions of masculinity, sexual identity, and body image.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Schepisi |first1=Giuseppe |last2=De Padova |first2=Silvia |last3=De Lisi |first3=Delia |last4=Casadei |first4=Chiara |last5=Meggiolaro |first5=Elena |last6=Ruffilli |first6=Federica |last7=Rosti |first7=Giovanni |last8=Lolli |first8=Cristian |last9=Ravaglia |first9=Giorgia |last10=Conteduca |first10=Vincenza |last11=Farolfi |first11=Alberto |last12=Grassi |first12=Luigi |last13=De Giorgi |first13=Ugo |date=2019-02-25 |title=Psychosocial Issues in Long-Term Survivors of Testicular Cancer |journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology |volume=10 |page=113 |doi=10.3389/fendo.2019.00113 |doi-access=free |pmid=30858829 |pmc=6397854 |issn=1664-2392}}</ref> Castration or partial removal is associated with fantasies, beliefs, myths, and cultural norms surrounding the testes, which can lead to severe psychological trauma and consequences for the individual.<ref name=":2" /> Consequently, worries regarding sexual and reproductive capabilities may induce feelings of despair, inadequacy, and emotional turmoil.<ref name=":2" /> Factors that are associated with a decrease in psychological outcomes are early adulthood, partnership status, work status, sexual dysfunction, diminished masculinity, and adaptive mechanisms. <ref name=":1" />

New research shows that testicular cancer survivors who have low testosterone levels feel less masculine than those with normal testosterone levels.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Allan “Ben” |last2=Rutherford |first2=Claudia |last3=Butow |first3=Phyllis |last4=Olver |first4=Ian |last5=Luckett |first5=Tim |last6=Grimison |first6=Peter |last7=Toner |first7=Guy |last8=Stockler |first8=Martin |last9=King |first9=Madeleine |date=April 2018 |title=A systematic review of quantitative observational studies investigating psychological distress in testicular cancer survivors |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pon.4596 |journal=Psycho-Oncology |language=en |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1129–1137 |doi=10.1002/pon.4596 |pmid=29171109 |hdl=11343/283526 |issn=1057-9249|hdl-access=free }}</ref> These concerns are important for teenage boys going through puberty or recently experiencing physical changes, which can shape their developing understanding of their sexual identity.<ref name=":4" /> For example, [[gynecomastia]], which is when males develop enlarged breasts during puberty, is a common and normal part of growing up.<ref name=":4" /> However, only up to 11% of patients diagnosed with testicular cancer have gynecomastia when they first seek medical attention, and about 4% of males checked for gynecomastia turn out to have testicular cancer.<ref name=":4" /> After testicular cancer, some men feel less masculine, but how much cancer affects masculinity varies from person to person.<ref name=":3" /> 

=== Body Image ===
New studies show that 16% of survivors have serious concerns about how they look after the removal of a testicle.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last1=Carpentier |first1=Melissa Y. |last2=Fortenberry |first2=J. Dennis |date=August 2010 |title=Romantic and Sexual Relationships, Body Image, and Fertility in Adolescent and Young Adult Testicular Cancer Survivors: A Review of the Literature |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |language=en |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=115–125 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.04.005|pmid=20638003 |pmc=2907366 }}</ref> These survivors worry about feeling awkward and anxious because of their missing testicles, and they feel different from other people.<ref name=":5" /> Even though 52% of survivors felt that their bodies had changed a lot because of cancer and treatment, 88% of the spouses didn't think their partners were any less attractive.<ref name=":5" />

How survivors feel about their bodies is a big factor in deciding whether to get a testicular prosthesis.<ref name=":5" /> Many worry about losing their masculinity, and how they see themselves, and just want to look and feel normal again.<ref name=":5" /> Looking back at how testicular prostheses were used, especially with many teenagers, there were noticeable improvements in how people felt about their bodies and themselves overall one year after getting an implant.<ref name=":5" /> They also felt more comfortable during sexual activities.<ref name=":5" />

=== Anxiety and Depression ===
[[File:Mental Health Portrait.jpg|thumb]]
After having the testicles removed through orchiectomy, testicular cancer survivors may experience long-lasting feelings of sadness or embarrassment.<ref name=":2" /> Research has shown that these emotions are more prevalent among younger and unmarried men compared to older and partnered individuals.<ref name=":2" /> The most common psychological problem faced by men diagnosed with testicular cancer is anxiety.<ref name=":1" /> New research suggested that there was no direct comparison between people who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer and the general population.<ref name=":1" /> Studies show that anxiety is more frequent among testicular cancer survivors of similar gender and age compared to the general population, affecting about 1 in 5 survivors.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" /> Depression doesn't seem to burden testicular cancer patients as much as anxiety.<ref name=":1" />

=== Fear of Recurrence ===
Around one out of every three testicular cancer survivors experience significant fear of the cancer coming back, and this fear is considered the most troubling issue for them.<ref name=":4" /> Unmarried men reported they felt less fear of cancer recurrence than men who were in a relationship.<ref name=":1" /> Survivors who have a fear of recurrence of their cancer tend to have more:

* Intrusive thoughts
* Feel more depressed
* Stressed
* Experience poorer physical well-being<ref name=":4" /> 

Being diagnosed with testicular cancer often destroys many men's feelings of being invincible and brings up unexpected questions about life and purpose.<ref name=":4" /> They feel a sense of being in between or on the threshold of a new identity.<ref name=":4" /> This involves feeling disconnected from those who haven't been through a similar intense experience, questioning the purpose of their existence, and becoming more aware of life's fragility and the certainty of death.<ref name=":4" /> New research suggests that certain testicular cancer survivors think their cancer was triggered by their stress sensitivity.<ref name=":4" /> This may be why some survivors have a fear of recurrence more than 10 years after treatment, even though the actual risk of recurrence is around 1%.<ref name=":4" />

=== Biological and Psychological Factors of Sexual Dysfunction ===
Sexual dysfunction can present as a symptom in people who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer.<ref name=":2" /> [[Sexual dysfunction]] can stem from biological factors, psychological factors, or a blend of both.<ref name=":2" /> Difficulties in physiological aspects such as achieving erection and ejaculation are correlated with the severity of the disease and the methods of treatment employed such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.<ref name=":2" /> Conversely, psychological aspects such as [[libido]] and satisfaction remain unaffected by the type of treatment received.<ref name=":2" /> Nonetheless, treatment approaches for testicular cancer can induce physiological alterations while simultaneously eliciting emotional responses.<ref name=":2" />  Therefore, diminished sexual function (such as decreased libido or inhibition) may result from treatment-related physical factors like fatigue, overall discomfort, hair loss, and significant weight fluctuations, as well as emotional factors including concerns about sexual performance, fear of losing control, and ambiguity regarding what lies ahead.<ref name=":2" />

=== [[Post-traumatic growth|Post-traumatic Growth]] From Testicular Cancer ===
Not every survivor of testicular cancer has negative outcomes of depression and some even may gain positive outcomes from their experience.<ref name=":4" /> This means that when you look at outcomes across all testicular cancer survivors, the positives and negatives could balance each other out.<ref name=":4" /> Many cancer survivors, both young and older adults, have reported benefits and personal growth in the months and even years following their diagnosis.<ref name=":4" /> Furthermore, researchers have discovered that while the journey of testicular cancer initially brings physical and emotional challenges, it also leads many survivors to develop a newfound gratitude for life.<ref name=":4" /> Besides improving mental outlook, going through testicular cancer might also motivate men to adopt healthier behaviors such as:

* More physical activity
* Reduce or stop smoking<ref name=":4" />

These positive changes in lifestyle could contribute to better psychological well-being, which can offset any initial difficulties they face.<ref name=":4" />

==Epidemiology==
Globally testicular cancer resulted in 8,300 deaths in 2013 up from 7,000 deaths in 1990.<ref name=GDB2013/> Testicular cancer has the highest prevalence in the U.S. and Europe, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa.<ref name="ACS" />  Worldwide incidence has doubled since the 1960s,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Hemelrijck |first1=Mieke |last2=Shanmugalingam |first2=Thurkaa |last3=Soultati |first3=Aspasia |last4=Chowdhury |first4=Simon |last5=Rudman |first5=Sarah |title=Global incidence and outcome of testicular cancer |journal=Clinical Epidemiology |date=October 2013 |volume=5 |pages=417–427 |doi=10.2147/CLEP.S34430|pmid=24204171 |pmc=3804606 |doi-access=free }}</ref> with the highest rates of prevalence in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Although testicular cancer is most common among men aged 15–40 years, it has three peaks: infancy through the age of four as [[teratoma]]s and [[yolk sac tumor]]s, ages 25–40 years as post-pubertal seminomas and non-seminomas, and from age 60 as spermatocytic tumors.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Leendert H.

===United States===
In the United States, about 8,900 cases are diagnosed a year.<ref name=SEER2017/> The risk of testicular cancer in [[White people|white]] men is approximately 4-5 times the risk in [[Black people|black]] men, and more than three times that of [[Asian American]] men.<ref name="ACS">[http://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicularcancer/moreinformation/doihavetesticularcancer/do-i-have-testicular-cancer-facts-and-risk-factors Some facts about testicular cancer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102022807/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicularcancer/moreinformation/doihavetesticularcancer/do-i-have-testicular-cancer-facts-and-risk-factors |date=2 November 2014 }}, American Cancer Society.</ref> The risk of testicular cancer in [[Latinos]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] is between that of white and Asian men.<ref name="ACS" /> The cause of these differences is unknown.<ref name="ACS" />

==Other animals==
Testicular tumors occur also in other animals.  In [[horse]]s, these include [[interstitial cell tumor]]s and teratomas.  Typically, the former are found in older [[stallion]]s (affected stallions may become extremely vicious, suggesting excessive production of [[androgen]]), and the latter are found in young horses and are large.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fXzJrDfFgUC |title=Veterinary pathology |vauthors=Jones TC, Hunt RD, King NW |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=1997 |isbn=9780683044812 |edition=6th |page=1210}}</ref>
