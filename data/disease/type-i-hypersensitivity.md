'''Type I hypersensitivity''' (or '''immediate hypersensitivity'''), in the [[Hypersensitivity|Gell and Coombs classification]] of allergic reactions, is an [[allergic reaction]] provoked by re-exposure to a specific type of [[antigen]] referred to as an [[allergen]].<ref>{{eMedicine|med|1101}}</ref>  Type I is distinct from [[Type II hypersensitivity|type II]], [[Type III hypersensitivity|type III]] and [[Type IV hypersensitivity|type IV]] hypersensitivities. The relevance of the Gell and Coombs classification of allergic reactions has been questioned in the modern-day understanding of allergy, and it has limited utility in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Descotes |first1=Jacques |last2=Choquet-Kastylevsky |first2=Geneviève |title=Gell and Coombs's classification: is it still valid? |journal=Toxicology |date=February 2001 |volume=158 |issue=1–2 |pages=43–49 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(00)00400-5 |pmid=11164991 }}</ref>

Exposure may be by [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[injection (medicine)|injection]], or direct contact.

==Pathophysiology==
In type I hypersensitivity, [[B cell|B&nbsp;cells]] are stimulated (by [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 model|CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>h</sub>2&nbsp;cells]]) to produce [[IgE]] antibodies specific to an antigen. The difference between a normal infectious immune response and a type 1 hypersensitivity response is that in type 1 hypersensitivity, the antibody is [[IgE]] instead of [[IgA]], [[IgG]], or [[IgM]].  During [[sensitization]], the IgE antibodies bind to [[FcεRI]] receptors on the surface of tissue [[mast cells]] and blood [[basophil]]s.<ref name="urlThe Adaptive Immune System: Type I Immediate Hypersensitivity">{{cite web |url=http://student.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit5/hypersensitivity/type1/type1.html |title=The Adaptive Immune System: Type I Immediate Hypersensitivity |access-date=2008-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727015923/http://student.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/lecguide/unit5/hypersensitivity/type1/type1.html |archive-date=2010-07-27 }}</ref> Mast cells and basophils coated by IgE antibodies are "sensitized". Later exposure to the same allergen cross-links the bound IgE on sensitized cells, resulting in [[anaphylactic degranulation]], which is the immediate and explosive release of pharmacologically active [[Mast cell#Mast cell mediators|pre-formed mediators]] from storage [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s and concurrent synthesis of inflammatory lipid mediators from [[arachidonic acid]];<ref name="Mast cell mediators - eoxins" /> some of these mediators include [[histamine]], [[leukotriene]] (LTC4 and LTD4 and LTB4), and [[prostaglandin]], which act on [[protein]]s (e.g., [[G-protein coupled receptor]]s) located on surrounding tissues.<ref name="Mast cell mediators - eoxins">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moon TC, Befus AD, Kulka M | title = Mast cell mediators: their differential release and the secretory pathways involved | journal = Front Immunol | volume = 5 | pages = 569 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25452755 | pmc = 4231949 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00569 | quote = This release of pre-formed mediators enables not only rapid anaphylactic reactions and allergic responses but also initiates recruitment of leukocytes to sites of pathogen invasion, activation of innate immune processes, and inflammatory responses (1).&nbsp;... Two types of degranulation have been described for MC: piecemeal degranulation (PMD) and anaphylactic degranulation (AND) (Figures 1 and 2). Both PMD and AND occur in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro in MC in human (78–82), mouse (83), and rat (84). PMD is selective release of portions of the granule contents, without granule-to-granule and/or granule-to-plasma membrane fusions.&nbsp;... In contrast to PMD, AND is the explosive release of granule contents or entire granules to the outside of cells after granule-to-granule and/or granule-to-plasma membrane fusions (Figures 1 and 2). Ultrastructural studies show that AND starts with granule swelling and matrix alteration after appropriate stimulation (e.g., FcεRI-crosslinking).| doi-access = free }}<br />[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231949/figure/F1/ Figure 1: Mediator release from mast cells]<br />[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231949/figure/F2/ Figure 2: Model of genesis of mast cell secretory granules]<br />[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231949/figure/F3/ Figure 3: Lipid body biogenesis]<br />[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231949/table/T2/ Table 2: Stimuli-selective mediator release from mast cells]</ref> The principal effects of these products are [[vasodilation]] and [[smooth muscle|smooth-muscle]] contraction.

Type I hypersensitivity can be further classified into immediate and late-phase reactions. Within minutes of exposure to an antigen, the immediate hypersensitivity occurs, releasing histamines and lipid mediators which are responsible for the initial allergic reaction response. However, about 4-12 hours after antigen exposure, a cough and wheezing may persist in the patient, along with swelling and redness of the skin. This is known as the late-phase hypersensitivity reaction which can last from approximately 1-3 days and is caused by the release of additional mediators from the mast cells and basophils.<ref>{{Citation |last=Abbas |first=Malak |title=Type I Hypersensitivity Reaction |date=2024 |work=StatPearls |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560561/ |access-date=2024-03-15 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=32809396 |last2=Moussa |first2=Mohamed |last3=Akel |first3=Hassan}}</ref>

The reaction may be either local or systemic. Symptoms vary from mild irritation to sudden death from [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]].

==Treatment and prognosis==

If multiple systems are involved, then [[anaphylaxis]] can take place, which is an acute, systemic reaction that can prove fatal.

Treatment usually involves [[adrenaline]] ([[epinephrine]]) because it counteracts anaphylaxis by increasing blood flow and relaxing bronchial muscles that block one’s airways.<ref>Kemp, S. F., Lockey, R. F., Simons, F. E., & World Allergy Organization ad hoc Committee on Epinephrine in Anaphylaxis (2008). Epinephrine: the drug of choice for anaphylaxis-a statement of the world allergy organization.
