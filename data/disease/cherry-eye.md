==Description==

Cherry eye is most common in young dogs, especially breeds such as [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]], [[English Bulldog]], [[Lhasa Apso]], [[Shih Tzu]], [[West Highland White Terrier]], [[Pug]], [[Bloodhound]], [[American Cocker Spaniel]], and [[Boston Terrier]].<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> Cherry eye is rare in felines, but can occur. This defect is most common in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] breed of felines.<ref name="autogenerated3">Griffin, C., & Glaze, M. B. (2008). "Eyes and Ears". St John U.S.V.I. November 3–6. International Veterinary Seminars.</ref> A similar condition exists in dwarf lop-eared rabbits, which occurs in the [[harderian gland]]. Similar surgical treatment is necessary.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

There is likely a complicated and multigenic component involving genetic risk factors.<ref>Edelmann, M. L., Miyadera, K., Iwabe, S., & Komáromy, A. M. (2013). Investigating the inheritance of prolapsed nictitating membrane glands in a large canine pedigree. Veterinary ophthalmology, 16(6), 416–422. https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12015</ref> Some breeds are considered to be more susceptible to its development than others, including the Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Bull Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Cocker Spaniel, St. Bernard, Shar-pei, Shih Tzu and Poodle <ref>"Common Ocular Problems of Shih Tzu Dogs". ''[[Canadian Veterinary Journal]]'', Volume 33, 392.</ref> The NM contains many glands which merge and appear as a single gland.<ref name="autogenerated80">Sarma, B. (2010). "Cherry Eye in Dogs. ''Intas Polivet'', 11, pp. 80–81.</ref> Typically, glands secrete tears for lubrication of the cornea.<ref name="autogenerated80"/> Lack of anchoring allows the gland to flip up, causing the gland to prolapse. Symptoms include a visible fleshy mass, abnormal tear production, and a discharge or drainage from the eye. Cherry eye is typically diagnosed by examination of the [[conjunctiva]] and [[nictitating membrane]].<ref name="autogenerated2001"/> The most obvious symptom of cherry eye is a round fleshy mass in the medial [[canthus]] of the eye, similar in appearance to the fruit it is named for.<ref name="autogenerated80"/> This mass may be unilateral or ‘’bilateral’’. Both eyes may develop cherry eye at different times in the animal's life.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> Other symptoms of cherry eye include drainage from the eye and abnormal tear production. Initially, cherry eye results in overproduction of tears, but eventually changes to unsubstantial tear production.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/>

==Treatment==

===Non-surgical===
Cherry eye, if caught early, can be resolved with a downward diagonal-toward-snout closed-eye massage of the affected eye or occasionally self-corrects alone or with antibiotics and steroids.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  Sometimes the prolapse will correct itself with no interference, or with slight physical manual massage manipulation as often as necessary coupled with medication.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Surgical===
Surgery is the most common means of repairing a cherry eye. Surgery involves gland replacement, not excision, by anchoring the membrane to the orbital rim or using a pocket technique.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In severely infected cases, preoperative antibiotics may be necessary by means of antibiotic eye ointment.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Removal of the gland was once an acceptable treatment, and made the eye appear completely normal.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Despite cosmetic appeal, removal of the gland reduces tear production by 30 percent. Tear production is essential in maintaining and protecting the eye from the external environment.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Reduced tear production is especially problematic in breeds of animals predisposed to [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] (KCS), also known as dry eye syndrome. With surgeries performed in this manner, KCS often results later in life.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

KCS is not common in dogs, affecting one per cent of the dog population.<ref>Blount, W. (n.d.). "[http://wendyblount.com/handouts-disease/ophthalmology/KCS.pdf Dry Eye: More formally known as Keratoconjuntivis Sicca or KCS]". Retrieved 1 December 2012.</ref> KCS is a chronic degenerative conjunctivitis that can lead to impaired vision and blindness.<ref name="autogenerated2001"/> KCS has a wide array of causes including drug toxicity, cherry eye, previous surgery, trauma, and irradiation.<ref name="autogenerated2001"/> KCS can be treated, but treatment often spans the entirety of the animal's life.<ref name="autogenerated2001"/>

In contrast to this, several replacement surgical procedures exist to remedy cherry eye.<ref name="autogenerated2001"/> Replacement of the gland results in lower instances of dry eye later in life.<ref name="intranictitans228">Plummer, C., Kallberg, M., Gelatt, K., Gelatt, J., & Barrie, K. P. (2008). "Intranictitans tacking for replacement of prolapsed gland of the third eyelid in dogs". ''Veterinary Ophthalmology'', pp. 228–233.</ref> Surgery types are broken into two groups: anchoring procedures and pocket/envelope procedures.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> At least 8 surgical techniques currently exist.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> In anchoring procedures, the prolapsed gland must be sutured to the periorbital fascia, the [[sclera]], or the base of the [[third eyelid]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/> In contrast, pocket procedures involve suturing healthy tissue around the prolapsed to enclose and secure it.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Each of these techniques may be performed with an anterior or superior approach, depending on which direction of suturing will cause the least complications to the eye.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

====Anchoring method====
Originally, the anchoring method involved suturing the gland to the globe. This method was superseded over time due to the risky and difficult nature of the surgery, along with a high rate of recurrence.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Anchoring approaches from posterior may disrupt normal fluid excretion.<ref name="intranictitans228"/> Subsequently, an anterior approach was introduced.<ref name="intranictitans228"/> Disadvantages of anchoring techniques include restricted mobility of third eyelid, which is essential in the functions of fluid distribution and self-cleaning.<ref name="intranictitans228"/> New procedures are currently being explored to allow tacking of the NM without restricting movement of the third eyelid.<ref name="intranictitans228"/> Few studies compare results of surgeries, therefore choosing a procedure is a matter of preference.<ref name="intranictitans228"/>

====Envelope/pocket method====
The envelope method, often called the pocket technique, requires suturing of tissue around the prolapse, encasing it in a layer of conjunctiva.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Pocket techniques are easiest for doctors to learn.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> Pocket methods also have anterior and posterior versions. Posterior suturing techniques are the most commonly used because they cause the least complications, with no alterations in tear production.<ref name="intranictitans228"/> Surgery should only be attempted by experienced surgeons.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Inappropriate surgical techniques can result in many complications including cysts on the eye.<ref name="intranictitans228"/>

==Prognosis==

===Without treatment===
Previously, treatment was thought optional until the role of NM was fully understood.<ref name="autogenerated2000"/> The NM gland is responsible for 40–50% of tear production.<ref name="ophthalmologists1">{{cite web|title=Prolapsed gland of the third eyelid|url=http://www.acvo.org/new/public/common_diseases/cherryeye.shtml|publisher=American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists|access-date=2017-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804053537/http://www.acvo.org/new/public/common_diseases/cherryeye.shtml|archive-date=2017-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> If exposed for extended periods of time, the gland is at risk for trauma, secondary infection, and reduced tear production.<ref name="ophthalmologists1"/> Many complications can arise if left untreated: early closed-eye massage manipulation is recommended to prevent inflammation .<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Post treatment===
Postoperative treatment includes antibiotic eye ointment three times daily for two weeks.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> It is possible to have a relapse of the gland after surgery and require multiple surgeries.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> With treatment, it is possible for animals to live a normal life.
