==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Areas affected by osteoarthritis.gif|thumb|alt=Outline of female body indicating most affected areas|Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the hands (at the ends of the fingers and thumbs), neck, lower back, knees, and hips.]]
The main symptom is [[pain]], causing [[Disability|loss of ability]] and often stiffness. The pain is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called "[[crepitus]]") when the affected joint is moved, especially shoulder and knee joint. A person may also complain of [[Joint locking (symptom)|joint locking]] and joint instability. These symptoms would affect their daily activities due to pain and stiffness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinusas K | title = Osteoarthritis: diagnosis and treatment | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–56 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22230308 | url = https://www.aafp.org/afp/2012/0101/p49.html }}</ref> Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.<ref name="pmid22124595">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Figueiredo EC, Figueiredo GC, Dantas RT | title = Influence of meteorological elements on osteoarthritis pain: a review of the literature | language = pt | journal = Revista Brasileira de Reumatologia | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 622–628 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22124595 | doi = 10.1590/S0482-50042011000600008 | trans-title = Influence of meteorological elements on osteoarthritis pain: a review of the literature | title-link = doi | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands, feet, [[Vertebral column|spine]], and the large [[weight-bearing]] joints, such as the [[Hip joint|hips]] and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As osteoarthritis progresses, movement patterns (such as [[gait]]), are typically affected.<ref name=NIH2015/> Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of a [[joint effusion]] of the knee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-knee/basics/definition/con-20026072 |title=Swollen knee |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |date=2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720005600/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-knee/basics/definition/con-20026072 |archive-date=20 July 2017 }}</ref>

In smaller joints, such as at the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called [[Heberden's node]]s (on the [[distal interphalangeal joints]]) or [[Bouchard's nodes]] (on the proximal interphalangeal joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of [[bunion]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bunions/symptoms-causes/dxc-20262053|title=Bunions: Symptoms and causes|publisher=Mayo Clinic|date=8 November 2016|access-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421102330/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bunions/symptoms-causes/dxc-20262053|archive-date=21 April 2017 }}</ref> rendering them red or swollen.

==Causes==
Damage from mechanical stress with insufficient self repair by joints is believed to be the primary cause of osteoarthritis.<ref name=Brandt2009/> Sources of this stress may include misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; excess body weight; loss of strength in the muscles supporting a joint; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements.<ref name=Brandt2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt KD, Dieppe P, Radin E | title = Etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–24, xv | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19059018 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2008.08.009 | s2cid = 28990260 }}</ref> However [[exercise]], including running in the absence of injury, has not been found to increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis.<ref name=Bosomworth09>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosomworth NJ | title = Exercise and knee osteoarthritis: benefit or hazard? | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 871–878 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19752252 | pmc = 2743580 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Timmins KA, Leech RD, Batt ME, Edwards KL | title = Running and Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447–1457 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 27519678 | doi = 10.1177/0363546516657531 | s2cid = 21924096 | url = http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/23789/1/23789%20Timminsetal_RunningOAreview_AJSM_submitted.pdf | access-date = 15 July 2023 | archive-date = 30 March 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230330181156/http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/23789/1/23789%20Timminsetal_RunningOAreview_AJSM_submitted.pdf | url-status = dead }}</ref> Nor has [[cracking joints|cracking one's knuckles]] been found to play a role.<ref name="pmid21383216">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deweber K, Olszewski M, Ortolano R | title = Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis | journal = Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–174 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21383216 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156 | title-link = doi | doi-access = free }}</ref> The risk of osteoarthritis increases with aging.

While osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes occur in the earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression.

==History==

===Etymology===
Osteoarthritis is derived from the [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:osteo-#English|osteo-]]'' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:ὀστέον|ὀστέον]]|ostéon|bone}}) combined with ''arthritis'' (from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀρθρῖτις|ἀρθρῖτῐς]]}}, {{transliteration|grc|arthrîtis}}, {{Literal translation|'of or in the joint'|lk=no}}), which is itself derived from ''[[wikt:arthr-|arthr-]]'' (from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]]}}, {{transliteration|grc|árthron}}, {{Literal translation|'joint, limb'|lk=no}}) and ''[[wikt:-itis#English|-itis]]'' (from {{lang|grc|-ῖτις}}, {{transliteration|grc|-îtis}}, {{Literal translation|'pertaining to'|lk=no}}), the latter [[suffix]] having come to be associated with [[inflammation]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Devaraj TL |title= Nature Cure for Common Diseases |year=2011 |publisher= Arya Publication |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-89093-74-7 |page=368 |chapter= Chapter 41: Nature cure yoga for osteoarthritis |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PdwRBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA368}}</ref> The ''-itis'' of osteoarthritis could be considered misleading as inflammation is not a conspicuous feature. Some clinicians refer to this condition as ''osteoarthrosis'' to signify the lack of inflammatory response,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanchev P |date= 17 April 2017 |title= Osteoarthritis or Osteoarthrosis: Commentary on Misuse of Terms |journal= Reconstructive Review |volume=7 |issue=1 |issn= 2331-2270 |doi=10.15438/rr.7.1.178|doi-access= free }}</ref> the suffix ''[[wikt:-osis#English|-osis]]'' (from {{lang|grc|-ωσις}}, {{transliteration|grc|-ōsis}}, {{Literal translation|'(abnormal) state, condition, or action'|lk=no}}) simply referring to the [[pathosis]] itself.
