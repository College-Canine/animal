The diagnosis of AKI is made based on a person's signs and symptoms, along with lab tests for serum creatinine and measurement of urine output.

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical presentation is often dominated by the underlying cause. The various symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[headache]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name=Skorecki>{{cite book |vauthors=Skorecki K, Green J, Brenner BM |veditors=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|url=https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00kasp |url-access=limited |edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-07-139140-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00kasp/page/n1681 1653]–63 |chapter=Chronic renal failure|display-editors=etal}}</ref> Marked increases in the [[potassium]] level can lead to [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], which can be severe and life-threatening.<ref name=Weisberg>{{cite journal | author = Weisberg LS | s2cid = 33811639 | title = Management of severe hyperkalemia | journal = Crit.

==Causes==
===Prerenal===
''Prerenal'' causes of AKI ("pre-renal azotemia") are those that decrease effective [[renal blood flow|blood flow to the kidney]] and cause a decrease in the [[glomerular filtration rate|glomerular filtration rate (GFR)]]. Both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function. Notable causes of prerenal AKI include [[hypovolemia|low blood volume]] (e.g., dehydration), [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[heart failure]] (leading to [[cardiorenal syndrome]]), [[hepatorenal syndrome]] in the context of liver cirrhosis, and local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney (e.g. NSAID induced vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole). The latter include [[renal artery stenosis]], or the narrowing of the [[renal artery]] which supplies the kidney with blood, and [[renal vein thrombosis]], which is the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] in the [[renal vein]] that drains blood from the kidney.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===Intrinsic or Intrarenal===
Intrinsic AKI refers to disease processes which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can be due to one or more of the kidney's structures including the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]], [[nephron|kidney tubules]], or the [[interstitium]]. Common causes of each are [[glomerulonephritis]], [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN), and [[acute interstitial nephritis]] (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are [[rhabdomyolysis]] and [[tumor lysis syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jim Cassidy |author2=Donald Bissett |author3=Roy A. J. Spence |author4=Miranda Payne |title=Oxford Handbook of Oncology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoQW4G0g14C&pg=PA706 |date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=706|isbn=978-0-19-956313-5 }}</ref> Certain medication classes such as [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[tacrolimus]]) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shirali |first1=Anushree |last2=Pazhayattil |first2=George Sunny |date=December 2014 |title=Drug-induced impairment of renal function |journal=International Journal of Nephrology and Renovascular Disease |volume=7 |pages=457–468 |doi=10.2147/ijnrd.s39747 |doi-access=free |pmid=25540591 |pmc=4270362 |issn=1178-7058}}</ref>

===Postrenal===
''Postrenal'' AKI refers to acute kidney injury caused by disease states downstream of the kidney and most often occurs as a consequence of [[urinary tract]] obstruction. This may be related to [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[Nephrolithiasis|kidney stones]], obstructed [[urinary catheter]], [[bladder stone]]s, or cancer of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Ureteral cancer|ureters]], or [[prostate cancer|prostate]].

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012,<ref name="pmid23732715">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens PE, Levin A | title = Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2012 clinical practice guideline | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 158 | issue = 11 | pages = 825–30 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23732715 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-158-11-201306040-00007 | s2cid = 46171014 }}</ref> specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of AKI.

AKI can be diagnosed if any one of the following is present:
* Increase in SCr by ≥0.3&nbsp;mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours; or
* Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which has occurred within the prior 7 days; or
* Urine volume < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.

===Staging===
The ''RIFLE criteria'', proposed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group, aid in assessment of the severity of a person's acute kidney injury. The acronym RIFLE is used to define the spectrum of progressive kidney injury seen in AKI:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellomo R, Ronco C, Kellum JA, Mehta RL, Palevsky P | title = Acute renal failure - definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group | journal = Crit Care | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R204–12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15312219 | pmc = 522841 | doi = 10.1186/cc2872 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lameire N, Van Biesen W, Vanholder R | title = Acute renal failure | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 365 | issue = 9457 | pages = 417–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15680458 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17831-3 | s2cid = 37093076 }}</ref>
[[File:Acute Renal Failure.svg|thumb|Pathophysiology of acute kidney injury in the proximal renal tubule]]
* Risk: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease by 25 percent, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg per hour for six hours.
* Injury: Two-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 50 percent, or urine output <0.5 mL/kg per hour for 12 hours.
* Failure: Three-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 75 percent, or urine output of <0.3 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours, or no urine output (anuria) for 12 hours.
* Loss: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than four weeks.
* [[End-stage kidney disease]]: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than three months.

===Evaluation===
The deterioration of kidney function may be signaled by a measurable decrease in urine output. Often, it is diagnosed on the basis of [[blood test]]s for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: [[urea]] and [[creatinine]]. Additionally, the [[BUN-to-creatinine ratio|ratio of BUN to creatinine]] is used to evaluate kidney injury. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers have been proposed (such as [[NGAL]], [[KIM-1]], [[Interleukin 18|IL18]] and [[cystatin C]]), but none of them are established enough as of 2018 to replace creatinine as a marker of kidney function.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=P|year=2018|title=The future for diagnostic tests of acute kidney injury in critical care: evidence synthesis, care pathway analysis and research prioritisation.|url=https://doi.org/10.3310%2Fhta22320|journal=[[Health Technology Assessment (journal)|Health Technology Assessment]]|volume=22|issue=32|pages=1–274|doi=10.3310/hta22320|pmc=6004543|pmid=29862965}}</ref>

Once the diagnosis of AKI is made, further testing is often required to determine the underlying cause. It is useful to perform a bladder scan or a post void residual to rule out urinary retention. In post void residual, a catheter is inserted into the urinary tract immediately after urinating to measure fluid still in the bladder. 50–100&nbsp;mL suggests [[neurogenic bladder dysfunction]].{{cn|date=March 2023}}

These may include urine sediment analysis, [[renal ultrasound]] and/or [[kidney biopsy]]. Indications for kidney biopsy in the setting of AKI include the following:<ref name="isbn0-07-159124-9">{{cite book |vauthors=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |title=Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-07-159124-9}}</ref>

In [[medical imaging]], the acute changes in the kidney are often examined with [[renal ultrasonography]] as the first-line modality, where [[CT scan]] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for the follow-up examinations and when US fails to demonstrate abnormalities. In evaluation of the acute changes in the kidney, the echogenicity of the renal structures, the delineation of the kidney, the renal vascularity, kidney size and focal abnormalities are observed.<ref name=Hansen2015>Content initially copied from: {{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Kristoffer|last2=Nielsen|first2=Michael|last3=Ewertsen|first3=Caroline|title=Ultrasonography of the Kidney: A Pictorial Review|journal=Diagnostics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2015|pages=2|issn=2075-4418|doi=10.3390/diagnostics6010002|pmid=26838799|pmc=4808817|doi-access=free}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC-BY 4.0)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=2017-10-16 }}</ref> CT is preferred in renal traumas, but US is used for follow-up, especially in the patients suspected for the formation of [[urinoma]]s.

===Classification===
Acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of [[clinical history]] and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in [[renal function|kidney function]], as measured by serum [[creatinine]], or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed [[oliguria]] (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).{{cn|date=March 2023}}

AKI can be caused by systemic disease (such as a manifestation of an autoimmune disease, e.g., [[lupus nephritis]]), [[crush syndrome|crush injury]], [[Contrast-induced nephropathy|contrast agents]], some antibiotics, and more. AKI often occurs due to multiple processes. The most common cause is dehydration and sepsis combined with nephrotoxic drugs, especially following surgery or [[contrast agents]].{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The causes of acute kidney injury are commonly categorized into ''prerenal'', ''intrinsic'', and ''postrenal''.

Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of patients following cardiac surgery.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thiele RH, Isbell JM, Rosner MH | title = AKI associated with cardiac surgery | journal = Clin J Am Soc Nephrol | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 500–14 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25376763 | pmc = 4348689 | doi = 10.2215/CJN.07830814}}</ref> Mortality increases by 60-80% in post-cardiopulmonary bypass patients who go on to require renal replacement therapy. Preoperative creatinine greater than 1.2&nbsp;mg/dL, combined valve and bypass procedures, emergency surgery, and preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump are risk factors most strongly correlated with post-cardiopulmonary bypass acute kidney injury. Other well-known minor risk factors include female gender, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.<ref name=":1" /> Volatile anesthetic agents have been shown to increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), which causes retention of salts and water, diminished renal blood flow (RBF) and an increase in serum renin levels, but not in antidiuretic hormone (ADH).<ref name="Role of Renal Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Volatile Anesthesia's Effect on Renal Excretory Function">{{Cite journal |last1=Taavo |first1=Micael |last2=Rundgren |first2=Mats |last3=Frykholm |first3=Peter |last4=Larsson |first4=Anders |last5=Franzén |first5=Stephanie |last6=Vargmar |first6=Karin |last7=Valarcher |first7=Jean F |last8=DiBona |first8=Gerald F |last9=Frithiof |first9=Robert |date=2021-10-14 |title=Role of Renal Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Volatile Anesthesia's Effect on Renal Excretory Function |url=https://academic.oup.com/function/article/doi/10.1093/function/zqab042/6355435 |journal=Function |language=en |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=zqab042 |doi=10.1093/function/zqab042 |pmid=35330795 |pmc=8788708 |issn=2633-8823}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a [[nephrologist]]. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called [[nephrotoxin]]s. These include [[NSAID]]s such as [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]], [[iodinated contrast]]s such as those used for [[CT scan]]s, many [[antibiotics]] such as [[gentamicin]], and a range of other substances.<ref name=pmid18492867 />

Monitoring of kidney function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]] helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===Prerenal===
In prerenal AKI without [[hypervolemia|fluid overload]], administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s is typically the first step to improving kidney function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a [[central venous catheter]] to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

If [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] persists despite providing a person with adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase blood pressure ([[vasopressor]]s) such as [[norepinephrine (drug)|norepinephrine]], and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart's ability to pump (known as [[inotrope]]s) such as [[dobutamine]] may be given to improve blood flow to the kidney. While a useful vasopressor, there is no evidence to suggest that [[dopamine]] is of any specific benefit and may in fact be harmful.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes CL, Walley KR | title = Bad medicine: low-dose dopamine in the ICU | journal = Chest | volume = 123 | issue = 4 | pages = 1266–75 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12684320 | doi = 10.1378/chest.123.4.1266 }}</ref>

===Intrinsic===
The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to [[steroid]] medication, [[cyclophosphamide]], and (in some cases) [[Plasmapheresis|plasma exchange]]. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, [[aminoglycosides]], [[penicillins]], NSAIDs, or [[paracetamol]].<ref name=Brady />

The use of [[diuretics]] such as [[furosemide]], is widespread and sometimes convenient in improving fluid overload. It is not associated with higher mortality (risk of death),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Uchino S, Doig GS, Bellomo R, Morimatsu H, Morgera S, Schetz M, Tan I, Bouman C, Nacedo E, Gibney N, Tolwani A, Ronco C, Kellum JA | s2cid = 2642777 | title = Diuretics and mortality in acute renal failure | journal = Crit.

===Postrenal===
If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a [[nephrostomy]] or [[urinary catheter]]) may be necessary.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

===Renal replacement therapy===
[[Renal replacement therapy]], such as with [[hemodialysis]], may be instituted in some cases of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of [[intermittent hemodialysis]] and [[continuous venovenous hemofiltration]] (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis).<ref name="pmid18285591">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pannu N, Klarenbach S, Wiebe N, Manns B, Tonelli M | title = Renal replacement therapy in patients with acute renal failure: a systematic review | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 299 | issue = 7 | pages = 793–805 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18285591 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.7.793 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18285591 }}</ref> Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis.<ref name="pmid18492867">{{cite journal |vauthors=Palevsky PM, Zhang JH, O'Connor TZ, Chertow GM, Crowley ST, Choudhury D, Finkel K, Kellum JA, Paganini E, Schein RM, Smith MW, Swanson KM, Thompson BT, Vijayan A, Watnick S, Star RA, Peduzzi P | title = Intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–20 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18492867 | pmc = 2574780 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0802639 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19846848">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellomo R, Cass A, Cole L, Finfer S, Gallagher M, Lo S, McArthur C, McGuinness S, Myburgh J, Norton R, Scheinkestel C, Su S | title = Intensity of continuous renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 17 | pages = 1627–38 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19846848 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0902413 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:694105/UQ694105_OA.pdf }}</ref> However, other clinical and health economic studies demonstrated that, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis and was cost-effective compared with IRRT in patients with acute kidney injury.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schoenfelder|first1=T|last2=Chen|first2=X|last3=Bless|first3=HH|title=Effects of continuous and intermittent renal replacement therapies among adult patients with acute kidney injury|journal=GMS Health Technol Assess|date=March 2017|volume=13|issue=Doc01 (20170301)|url=http://www.egms.de/static/en/journals/hta/2017-13/hta000127.shtml|access-date=8 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154219/http://www.egms.de/static/en/journals/hta/2017-13/hta000127.shtml|archive-date=8 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=AG|last2=Bellomo|first2=R|last3=Bagshaw|first3=SM|last4=Glassford|first4=NJ|last5=Lo|first5=S|last6=Jun|first6=M|last7=Cass|first7=A|last8=Gallagher|first8=M|title=Choice of renal replacement therapy modality and dialysis dependence after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=June 2013|volume=39|issue=6|pages=987–97|doi=10.1007/s00134-013-2864-5|pmid=23443311|url=http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/218110/1/Choice%20of%20renal%20replacement%20therapy%20modality%20and%20dialysis%20dependence%20after%20acute%20kidney%20injury.pdf|hdl=11343/218110|s2cid=25491242|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1916471 | doi=10.1080/14737167.2021.1916471 | title=A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of continuous versus intermittent renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury | year=2022 | last1=Singh | first1=Ambrish | last2=Hussain | first2=Salman | last3=Kher | first3=Vijay | last4=Palmer | first4=Andrew J. | last5=Jose | first5=Matthew | last6=Antony | first6=Benny | journal=Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research | volume=22 | issue=1 | pages=27–35 | pmid=33934689 | s2cid=233484979 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
===Mortality===
Mortality after AKI remains high. AKI has a death rate as high as 20%, which may reach up to 50% in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU). Each year, around two million people die of AKI worldwide.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Shao-Bin|last2=Liu|first2=Fu-You|last3=Liu|first3=Hong|last4=Tang|first4=Mi-Mi|last5=Li|first5=Xu-Wei|last6=Cheng|first6=Wei|last7=Xu|first7=Jun|last8=Yang|first8=Yuan|last9=Luo|first9=Min|date=2017-08-11|title=A new scoring model for the prediction of mortality in patients with acute kidney injury|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=7862|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08440-w|pmid=28801674|pmc=5554175|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.7862L}}</ref>

===Kidney function===
Depending on the cause, a proportion of patients (5–10%) will never regain full kidney function, thus entering [[end-stage kidney failure]] and requiring lifelong dialysis or a [[kidney transplant]]. Patients with AKI are more likely to die prematurely after being discharged from hospital, even if their kidney function has recovered.<ref name=harrison18 />

The risk of developing [[chronic kidney disease]] is increased (8.8-fold).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coca|first1=SG|last2=Singanamala|first2=S|last3=Parikh|first3=CR|title=Chronic kidney disease after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Kidney International|date=March 2012|volume=81|issue=5|pages=442–48|doi=10.1038/ki.2011.379|pmid=22113526|pmc=3788581}}</ref>

New cases of AKI are unusual but not rare, affecting approximately 0.1% of the UK population per year (2000 ppm/year), 20x incidence of new ESKD (end-stage kidney disease).

==History==
Before the advancement of [[modern medicine]], acute kidney injury was referred to as ''uremic poisoning'' while [[uremia]] was contamination of the [[blood]] with [[urine]]. Starting around 1847, ''uremia'' came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called [[oliguria]], which was thought to be caused by the urine's mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the [[urethra]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=oliguria {{!}} Origin and meaning of oliguria by Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/oliguria|access-date=2021-01-29|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en}}</ref>

Acute kidney injury due to [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) was recognized in the 1940s in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], where [[Crush syndrome|crush injury]] victims during the [[London Blitz]] developed patchy necrosis of kidney tubules, leading to a sudden decrease in kidney function.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bywaters EG, Beall D | title = Crush injuries with impairment of renal function. | journal = [[British Medical Journal|Br Med J]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4185 | pages = 427–32 | year = 1941 | pmid = 20783577 | pmc = 2161734 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4185.427 }}</ref> During the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam wars]], the incidence of AKI decreased due to better acute management and administration of [[intravenous fluid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schrier RW, Wang W, Poole B, Mitra A | title = Acute renal failure: definitions, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy | journal = J.
