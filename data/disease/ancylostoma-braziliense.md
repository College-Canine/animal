'''''Ancylostoma braziliense''''' is a species of [[hookworm]] belonging to the genus ''[[Ancylostoma]]''. It is an intestinal parasite of domestic [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s. Severe infection is often fatal to these pets, especially in puppies and kittens. The infection is particularly endemic in the southern United States. It is most often confused with the [[zoonotic]] hookworm species ''[[Ancylostoma ceylanicum]]'' because of their uncanny resemblance.<ref name=chap>{{cite web| author= Chapman S | title= ''Ancylostoma braziliense'' |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ancylostoma_braziliense/ |year=2012 |work= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= Regents of the University of Michigan |access-date=2013-06-30}}</ref>

''Ancylostoma braziliense'' larvae can cause accidental infection in humans called [[Cutaneous larva migrans|cutaneous larval migration]] or creeping eruption, which produces severe itching in the skin. It is the most common skin infection in tropical region, particularly along the beaches of the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bowman|first1=Dwight D.|last2=Montgomery|first2=Susan P.|last3=Zajac|first3=Anne M.|last4=Eberhard|first4=Mark L.|last5=Kazacos|first5=Kevin R.|title=Hookworms of dogs and cats as agents of cutaneous larva migrans|journal=Trends in Parasitology|year=2010|volume=26|issue=4|pages=162–167|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2010.01.005|pmid=20189454}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Feldmeier|first1=H.|last2=Schuster|first2=A.|s2cid=14834364|title=Mini review: hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans|journal= [[European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases]] |year=2012|volume=31|issue=6|pages=915–918|doi=10.1007/s10096-011-1404-x|pmid=21922198}}</ref>

==Discovery and history==

When ''A. braziliense'' was described by Gomes de Faria in 1910, and ''A. ceylanicum'' by [[Arthur Looss]] in 1911, the two species were regarded as [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] because of their apparent similarities in almost all respect. Especially in 1913, comparison of specimens from human, [[dog]], [[cat]] and [[lion]] infections in India led to the conclusion that they were definitely of the same species. In 1915 Gomes de Faria realised that the two were distinct species based on their [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures. Till 1921 the two hookworms were accepted as a two valid species. However, in 1922 Gordon made an exhaustive comparison from specimens collected in Brazil, South Africa and India, and his conclusion was that there were no significant distinction. Other [[parasitologist]]s were also convinced of this so that the two names were again considered synonymous. In 1951 Biocca made an elaborate study on different hookworms in the collection of [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and personal collections. He finally identified the defining characters between the two for [[Biological classification|classifying]] them as distinct species, which eventually gained general acceptance.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Yushida Y |title= Comparative studies on ''Ancylostoma braziliense'' and ''Ancylostoma ceylanicum''.

==Distribution==

''A. braziliense'' is endemic in the southern United States. It is also found in a number of subtropical regions around the world, including [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], South Africa,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Minnaar|first1=W.N|last2=Krecek|first2=R.C|last3=Fourie|first3=L.J|title=Helminths in dogs from a peri-urban resource-limited community in Free State Province, South Africa|journal=Veterinary Parasitology|year=2002|volume=107|issue=4|pages=343–349|doi=10.1016/S0304-4017(02)00155-3|pmid=12163245}}</ref> and southern Asia. In southern Asia, infection is confined to Indonesia, [[Borneo]], and Malaysia.<ref name=chap/>

== Physical description ==
Like many other worms, the female worm is larger than the male. Also, the females are more difficult to distinguish because the teeth sizes appear very similar among the various species of ''Ancylostoma.'' Male worms, however, have two broad lateral lobes and a smaller dorsal lobe with rays on the copulatory bursa. These bursal rays' aids in distinguishing the different species of ''Ancylostoma.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ancylostoma_braziliense/|title=ADW: : INFORMATION|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>

==Life cycle==

''Ancylostoma braziliense'' eggs are passed into the environment through the [[feces]] of cats and dogs. The eggs incubate on warm, moist soil, where they hatch into larvae. The infective juvenile penetrate the skin of the host. At this stage, the larvae are present in the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], [[hair follicles]], and glands of the skin, sometimes extending to [[sebaceous gland]]s where they form coils. Then they migrate to the [[heart]] and [[lung]] by moving along the blood circulation. In the lungs, the juveniles enter the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] and are propelled by cilia up the respiratory tract. From this, the host swallow them and deposit them in the small intestine. They get attached to the intestinal [[mucosa]] via the buccal capsule. Here they undergo two successive molts to become sexually mature individuals.<ref name=chap/>

== Etymology ==
Etymology''':''' ''Ancylo'' = curved + ''stoma'' = mouth; ''braziliense'' for the geographical location where the worms were first found.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aavp.org/wiki/nematodes/strongylida/ancylostomatoidea/ancylostoma-braziliense/|title=Ancylostoma braziliense {{!}} American Association of Veterinary Parasitologists|website=www.aavp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>

It is the most common ailment of tropically acquired [[dermatitis]], particularly along the beaches of the [[Caribbean]]. However, humans are not the natural [[definitive host]]s, and are therefore a dead-end for the parasites. In humans, the larvae die after few months without further development.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brenner MA, Patel MB |title= Cutaneous larva migrans: the creeping eruption |year =2003 | journal= Cutis | volume= 72 | issue= 2 |pages =111–115  |pmid= 12953933}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==
Ancylostoma braziliense is a parasite that infects cats and dogs and occasionally humans. And, they survive by eating blood from the intestine of cats and dogs, causing anemia. Pale gums and weakness are common signs of anemia. The infected animals also experience significant weight loss, bloody diarrhea, and are not able to grow up to their right size. Other symptoms like, skin irritation and itching is also caused by the larvae burrowing into the skin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/hookworm/index.html|title=CDC – DPDx – Hookworm|date=2017-12-13|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>

==Diagnosis and treatment==

''A. braziliense'' is difficult to differentiate from other hookworms. Microscopic examination of [[scatology|scatological]] samples can identify the eggs as they are generally smaller than those of other species.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lucio-Forster A, Liotta JL, Yaros JP, Briggs KR, Mohammed HO, Bowman DD |s2cid= 264410 |title= Morphological differentiation of eggs of Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and Ancylostoma braziliense from dogs and cats in the United States |year = 2012| journal= J Parasitol | volume= 98 | issue= 5 |pages = 1041–1044 |pmid= 22394087 |doi=10.1645/GE-2928.1 }}</ref>

Most [[benzimidazole]]s are effective. [[Mebendazole]], [[triclabendazole]] and [[fenbendazole]] are commonly used. [[Ivermectin]] and [[pyrantel pamoate]] are also effective. The combination of ivermectin 6 μg/kg and pyrantel pamoate at 5.0&nbsp;mg/kg is 100% efficacious against adult worms in dogs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Shoop WL, Michael BF, Soll MD, Clark JN |title= Efficacy of an ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate combination against adult hookworm, ''Ancylostoma braziliense'', in dogs |year = 1996| journal= Aust Vet J | volume= 73 | issue= 3 |pages = 84–85 |pmid= 8660218 |doi= 10.1111/j.1751-0813.1996.tb09981.x}}</ref> Human infection in case of [[cutaneous larva migrans]] is treated with oral [[thiabendazole]] at 500&nbsp;mg in 4 daily dose.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=O'Quinn JC, Dushin R |title= Cutaneous larva migrans: case report with current recommendations for treatment |year = 2005| journal= J Am Podiatr Med Assoc | volume= 95 | issue= 3 |pages = 291–294 |pmid= 15901819 | doi=10.7547/0950291}}</ref>
