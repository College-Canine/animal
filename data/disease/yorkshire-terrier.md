The '''Yorkshire Terrier''', also known as a '''Yorkie''', is a British [[dog breeds|breed]] of [[toy dog]] of [[terrier]] [[Dog type|type]]. It is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of [[list of dog breeds|all dog breeds]], with a weight of no more than {{convert|3.2|kg|abbr=on|0}}.{{r|kc}} It originated in the nineteenth century in the English [[counties of England|county]] of [[Yorkshire]], after which it is named.<ref name="Get to Know the Yorkshire Terrier">[http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/yorkshire-terrier/#standard "Get to Know the Yorkshire]", 'The American Kennel Club', retrieved 19 May 2014</ref> The coat is tan on the head and dark steel-grey on the body; no other colour is accepted by either [[The Kennel Club]] or the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]].{{r|kc|fci2}}

It is a playful and energetic dog, usually kept as a [[companion dog]]. It has contributed to the development of other breeds including the [[Australian Silky Terrier|Silky Terrier]], and also to [[list of crossbred dogs|cross-breeds]] such as the [[Yorkipoo]].

==History==

The Yorkshire Terrier originated in [[Yorkshire]]. In the mid-nineteenth century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and brought with them several varieties of [[terrier]] dogs. Breeding of the Yorkshire terrier was "principally accomplished by the people – mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills – in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire."<ref name="Shields">P. H. Combs in The American Book of the Dog, pg 443, edited by G. O. Shields, Rand, McNally & Company, Publishers, Chicago and New York 1891 no ISBN</ref>  In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fogle |first=Bruce |date=2000 |title=The New Encycyclopedia of Dog |location=USA |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao00fogl/page/272 272] |isbn=0-7894-6130-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao00fogl/page/272 }}</ref>

The breed originates from two distinct dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known.<ref>1885 article by Ed. Bootman of Halifax, England was printed in The Stock-Keeper, detailing the breed's origins, discussed pg 441-442 The American Book of the Dog, edited by G. O.

Yorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called "Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers". Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that "the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd" in lumping together these different types.<ref name="British Islands 1878, pg 213">quoted in ''The dogs of the British Islands'', by John Henry Walsh, The Field, publisher, 1878, Third Edition, pg 213</ref> In the early days of the breed, "almost anything in the shape of a Terrier having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs, with tail [[Docking (dog)|docked]] and ears trimmed, was received and admired as a Yorkshire Terrier".<ref name="Shields" /> But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley-type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named [[Huddersfield Ben]], owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.<ref name="Clark/Brace">{{cite book| last1 = Clark| first1 = Anne Rogers| author-link = Anne Rogers Clark| title = The International Encyclopedia of Dogs |first2 = Andrew H. | last2 = Brace | publisher = Howell Book House| year = 1995| page = 484| isbn = 0-87605-624-9}}</ref>

Adult Yorkshire Terriers whose coat colours deviate from the standard, or that have woolly or extra fine coats, are still Yorkshire Terriers. The only difference is that it is not recommended to intentionally breed atypical Yorkshire Terriers.<ref name="YTCAcolour">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyorkshireterrierclubofamerica.org/faq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318222408/http://www.ytca.org/faq.html#B|url-status=dead|title=Parti-Color Yorkshire Terriers?|archivedate=18 March 2009|website=www.theyorkshireterrierclubofamerica.org|accessdate=17 July 2022}}</ref> In addition, care may be more difficult for "woolly" or "cottony" textured coats, or coats that are overly fine.<ref name="AKCstandard" /> Coats may vary in colour. For example, a mature Yorkie may have a silver-blue with light brown, while another might have a black and creamy colour.

===Hypoallergenic coats===

{{Main|Hypoallergenic dog breed}}
The typical fine, straight, and silky Yorkshire Terrier [[Coat (dog)|coat]] has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being [[Hypoallergenic dog breed|hypoallergenic]]. In comparison with many other breeds, Yorkies do not shed to the same degree, losing small amounts when bathed or brushed.<ref>[http://www.entdocs.org/catallergy.htm Jeffrey Adelglass, M.D., ear, nose, throat and allergy information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130236/http://www.entdocs.org/catallergy.htm |date=1 December 2008 }} quote: "No dog is considered non-allergenic because all dogs produce dander, saliva and urine which are the offending allergens."</ref>  The dog's [[dander]] and saliva typically trigger allergic reactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pet-allergy/DS00859/DSECTION=causes|title=Pet allergy - Symptoms and causes|website=mayoclinic.com|access-date=15 April 2018}}</ref> Allergists recognise that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that "the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs."<ref name="NYTallergy">{{cite web | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D61E3DF936A35751C0A961958260&n=Top/News/Science/Topics/Animals | title = Nonallergenic Dog?

===Other colours===

The Yorkshire Terrier is a tan dog with a blue saddle. Particolours exist, although they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black-blue and tan. The white is caused by the [[recessive]] [[piebald]] gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive.<ref name="YTCAparti">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyorkshireterrierclubofamerica.org/faq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318222408/http://www.ytca.org/faq.html#C|url-status=dead|title=What Is A RESPONSIBLE BREEDER |author=Shirley Patterson Secretary of the YTCA |archivedate=18 March 2009|website=www.theyorkshireterrierclubofamerica.org|accessdate=17 July 2022}}</ref> Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce [[Melanin#Pheomelanin|pheomelanin]], others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they produce brown [[Melanin#Eumelanin|eumelanin]] instead of black eumelanin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowling|first=Sue|title=Coat Color Genetics - Brown Locus|url=http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Genetics/ColorGen.html#B|publisher=Sue Ann Bowling}}</ref><ref>Genomia: ''[https://www.genomia.cz/en/york/ Yorkshire Terrier coat colours]''</ref> The standard prescribes clearly defined fur-colours, and non-standard colours may indicate [[crossbreeding]] with other breeds or in rare cases even health problems.<ref name="YTCAcolour" /> The AKC registration form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is stated to be neither new, desirable, nor exotic.<ref name="YTCAparti" />

Mismatched Yorkshire Terriers should not be crossed with the [[Biewer Terrier]], a new breed that originated in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=December 28, 2020|title=The Biewer Terrier Was Developed in Germany by Werner and Gertrude Biewer, Making Its Debut in Germany in 1986.

===Puppy coats===
[[File:Winston, a Yorkshire Terrier puppy.jpg|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier puppy, displaying a black and tan coat]]

It may take three or more years for the coat to reach its final colour. The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour.<ref name="YTCA" /> P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, "and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.<ref>The American book of the Dog, edited by G. O. Shields, Rand, McNally & Company, Publishers, Chicago and New York, 1891, no ISBN. Section on the Yorkshire written by P. H. Combs</ref><ref name="ytca-standard">{{cite web | url=http://www.theyorkshireterrierclubofamerica.org/about-yorkies | title=Official Standard of the Yorkshire Terrier | publisher=Yorkshire Terrier Club of America | access-date=29 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Coat care ===
[[File:Yorkie or Yorkshire Terrier (11406003593).png|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier after a day at the groomer]]
Owners may trim the hair short for easier care. For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.<ref name="AKCstandard" /><ref name="KCstandard" /> The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily (a bristle brush for short and shaved coat and a pin brush for long coat). In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in [[rice paper]], [[tissue paper]] or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is "well greased" with [[coconut oil]], the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are "carefully kept in stockings".<ref>The Dogs of the British Islands, pg 212, by John Henry Walsh, The Field publisher, 1878, Third Edition</ref>

==Temperament==
[[File:Henri the yorki from alabama .jpg|alt=|thumb|The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as "conveying an important air". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.]]
The ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or "personality" has been described by [[the Kennel Club]] as having a "carriage very upright conveying an important air".<ref name="KCstandard" /> 

Yorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=The Intelligence of Dogs |year=2006|publisher=Pocket Books|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-4165-0287-6}}</ref>

* [[Distichia]]e, [[eyelash]]es arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jacque Lynn |title=The Terrier Tyke With a Big Attitude |publisher=ASPCA |year=2004 |url=http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |access-date=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234816/http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |archive-date=30 December 2004 }}</ref>  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]], and scarring. Treatment options may include manual removal, [[electrolysis]], or [[surgery]].<ref>{{citation | title =Distichiasis Can Damage Corneas in Cavaliers | publisher =Cavalier Health | year =2007 | url =http://cavalierhealth.net/distichiasis.htm | access-date =4 March 2007}}</ref>
* [[Hypoplasia of dens]] is a non-formation of the pivot point of the second [[cervical vertebrae|cervical vertebra]], which leads to [[spinal cord]] damage.<ref name=KSU/>  Onset of the condition may occur at any age, producing signs ranging from neck pain to [[quadriplegia]].<ref name=Bob>{{cite web | last =Linville | first =Robert L. | title =Breed Predisposition to Disease and Congenital Conditions | publisher =Dr. Bob's All Creatures Site | date =6 March 2006 | url =http://www.petdoc.ws/BreedPre.htm | access-date =13 March 2007}}</ref>
* [[Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome]], which causes the top of the [[femur]] (thigh bone) to [[Degeneration (medical)|degenerate]], occurs in Yorkies in certain lines.<ref name=Legg>{{cite web | last =Degner | first =Danial | title =Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (or Legg-Perthes disease) | publisher =Vet Surgery Central Inc. | year =2004 | url =http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/legg_calve.htm | access-date =4 March 2007}}</ref>  The condition appears to result from insufficient [[Circulatory system|circulation]] to the area around the [[Hip#Articulation|hip joint]]. As the blood supply is reduced, the bone in the head of the femur collapses and dies and the [[cartilage]] coating around it becomes cracked and deformed.<ref name=Legg/>  Usually the disease appears when the Yorkie is young (between five and eight months of age); signs are pain, limping or lameness.<ref name=Voit>{{cite web | last =Voit | first =Pam | title =Legg Perthe's Disease: What you Should Know | url =http://www.ahtluvr.com/ahtleggperthes.html | access-date =4 March 2007}}</ref>  The standard treatment is surgery to remove the affected part of the bone.<ref name=Voit/>  Following surgery, muscles hold the femur in place and fibrous tissue forms in the area of removal to prevent bone rubbing on bone.<ref name=FHO>{{cite web | last =Degner | first =Danial | title =Femoral Head and Neck Excision | publisher =Vet Surgery Central Inc. | year =2004 | url =http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/fho.htm | access-date =4 March 2007}}</ref>  Although the affected leg will be slightly shorter than prior to surgery, the Yorkie may regain almost normal use.<ref name=Voit/>
* [[Luxating patella]]s (slipping [[Patella|kneecap]]s) are another common defect considered to be genetic in Yorkies, although it may also be caused by an accidental fall. Weak [[ligament]]s and [[tendon]]s in the [[knee]] or malformed (too shallow) patellar grooves, allow the patella to slip out of its groove sideways.<ref name=Luxating>{{cite web | last1 =Foster | first1 = Race | last2 =Smith | first2 =  Marty | title =Luxating Patella | publisher =PetEducation.com | year =2007 | url =http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=2&cat=1569&articleid=457 |access-date =5 March 2007}}</ref> This causes the leg to 'lock up' with the foot held off the ground.<ref name=Luxating/> A dog with this problem may experience frequent pain and lameness, or may be bothered by it only on occasion. Over time, the patellar ridges can become worn down, making the groove even more shallow and causing the dog to become increasingly lame.<ref name=Luxating/>  Surgery is the main treatment option available for luxating patellas, although it is not necessary for every dog with the condition. The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.
* [[Portosystemic shunt]], a congenital malformation of the [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]] (which brings blood to the [[liver]] for cleansing), is also common in Yorkies. In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and the "dirty" blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, [[Abnormality (behavior)|behavioral abnormalities]], seizures (especially after a meal) and [[blindness]], which could lead to a coma and death. Often, the shunt can be treated with surgery.<ref name="UFAW website1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufaw.org.uk/PORTOSYSTEMICSHUNTYORKSHIRETERRIER.php |title=Portosystemic Shunt |work=Genetic Welfare Problems of Companion Animals |publisher=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare |location=ufaw.org.uk |access-date=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211131100/http://www.ufaw.org.uk/PORTOSYSTEMICSHUNTYORKSHIRETERRIER.php |archive-date=11 February 2015 }}</ref>
[[File:Trachealkollaps.png|thumb|Tracheal collapse]]
*[[Tracheal collapse]], caused by a progressive weakening of the walls of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], occurs in many toy breeds, especially very tiny Yorkies.<ref name=Degner>{{cite web | last =Degner | first =Danial | title =Tracheal Collapse | publisher =Vet Surgery Central Inc. | year =2004 | url =http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/tracheal_collapse.htm | access-date =4 March 2007}}</ref>  As a result of genetics, the walls of the trachea can be flaccid, a condition that becomes more severe with age. [[Cushing's syndrome (veterinary)|Cushing's syndrome]], a disorder that causes production of excess steroid hormone by the adrenal glands, can also weaken cartilage and lead to tracheal collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cavalierhealth.net/cushing.htm|title=Cushing's Disease & the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel|website=cavalierhealth.net|access-date=15 April 2018}}</ref>  There is a possibility that physical strain on the neck might cause or contribute to trachea collapse. Since this is usually caused by an energetic Yorkie pulling against his collar, many veterinarians recommend use of a harness for leashed walks.<ref name=Degner/>  An occasional "goose honking" cough, especially on exertion or excitement, is usually the first sign of this condition.<ref name=Degner/>  Over time, the cough may become almost constant in the Yorkie's later life. Breathing through the obstruction of a collapsed (or partially collapsed) trachea for many years can result in complications, including chronic lung disease. The coughing can be countered with [[Cough medicine|cough suppressant]]s and [[bronchodilator]]s.<ref name=Degner/>  If the collapse is advanced and unresponsive to medication, sometimes surgery can repair the trachea.<ref name=Degner/>

===Hypoglycaemia===
[[Blood sugar#Low blood sugar|Low blood sugar]] in puppies, or [[Hypoglycemia|transient juvenile hypoglycaemia]], is caused by fasting (too much time between meals).<ref name=Hypoglycaemia>{{cite web | title =Hypoglycemia symptoms and treatment | publisher =Go Pets America | url =http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dog-health/hypoglycemia.aspx | access-date =10 March 2007}}</ref>  In rare cases, hypoglycaemia may continue to be a problem in mature, usually very small, Yorkies. It is often seen in Yorkie puppies at 5 to 16 weeks of age.<ref name=Hypoglycaemia/>  Very tiny Yorkie puppies are especially predisposed to hypoglycaemia because a lack of muscle mass makes it difficult to store [[glucose]] and regulate blood sugar.<ref name=Hypoglycaemia/> Factors such as stress, fatigue, a cold environment, poor nutrition, and a change in diet or feeding schedule may bring on hypoglycaemia.<ref name=Chihuahua>{{cite web | last =O'Neil | first =Jacqueline | title =Dealing with Your Chihuahua's Health Issues (Adapted from ''Chihuahuas for Dummies'') | publisher =Dummies.com | year =2007 | url =http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-2062.html | access-date =10 March 2007}}</ref> Low blood sugar can also be the result of a [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infection]], [[parasitism|parasite]] or portosystemic liver shunt.<ref>{{cite web | last =Brooks | first =Wendy C. | title =Toy Breed Hypoglycemia | publisher =VeterinaryPartner.com | date =31 July 2005 | url =http://www.VeterinaryPartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=2085 | access-date =10 March 2007}}</ref> Hypoglycaemia causes the puppy to become drowsy, listless (glassy-eyed), shaky, uncpoglycaemic attack, the puppy usually has very pale or grey gums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkiesllc.com/yorkieinfo/yorkiehypoglycemia.html|title=系统发生错误|website=www.yorkiesllc.com|accessdate=17 July 2022}}</ref> The puppy also may not eat unless force-fed.<ref name=Hypoglycaemia/> Hypoglycaemia and dehydration seem to go hand-in-hand, and force-feeding or injecting fluids may also be necessary. Additionally, a hypoglycaemic Yorkie may have a lower than [[Normal human body temperature|normal body temperature]] and, in extreme cases, may have a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] or go into a [[coma]].<ref name=Lee>{{cite web | last =Weston | first =Lee | title =Hypoglycemia | publisher =Pomeranian Club of Canada | url =http://www.pcoc.net/hypoglycemia.htm | access-date =10 March 2007}}</ref> A dog showing [[symptom]]s should be given sugar in the form of corn syrup or Nutri-Cal and be treated by a [[veterinarian]] immediately, as prolonged or recurring attacks of hypoglycaemia can permanently damage the dog's brain.<ref name=Lee/> In severe cases, it can be fatal.<ref name=Hypoglycaemia/>

===Docking and Cropping===
{{Main|Docking (dog)}}
Traditionally, the Yorkshire Terrier's tail is docked to a medium length.<ref>{{cite web|title=FCI-Standard |url=http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/086gb2009_en.doc |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831162939/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/086gb2009_en.doc |archive-date=31 August 2012 }}</ref>   Opposition to this practice began very early in the history of the breed; Hugh Dalziel, writing about Yorkshire Terriers in 1878, declared that "There is no reason for mutilating pet dogs, and perfect ears and tails should be bred, not clipped into shape with scissors."<ref name="British Islands 1878, pg 213" /> AKC and [[Canadian Kennel Club]] still require the Yorkie's tail be docked in order to compete at its events.<ref name="AKCstandard" /> The majority of the rest of the world has adopted a "no docking/no [[Cropping (animal)|cropping]]" rule.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

==Related breeds and derived breeds==
The Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds, such as the [[Skye Terrier]] and the now-extinct [[Paisley Terrier]]. In its turn, other breeds have been created from the Yorkshire Terrier, such as the [[Australian Silky Terrier|Silky Terrier]]. Demand for unusual pets has resulted in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]] made up of [[syllable]]s (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent. Some of these such portmanteau-named [[Crossbreed|crosses]] can be found on the [[list of dog crossbreeds]].
<!--Editors: Do not add names or photographs of crosses/hybrids here, check the 'List of dog crossbreeds' page; if your cross isn't listed there, please add a note to the Talk tab for that page asking whether it's notable enough to be added. .-->
