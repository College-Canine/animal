==Causes==
Myxedema coma represents an extreme or decompensated form of hypothyroidism. Most cases occur in patients who have been previously diagnosed with hypothyroidism, yet in some cases, hypothyroidism may not have been previously identified. <ref name="wall2000" /><ref name="mathew2011" /><ref name="elshimy2022" />

Common precipitating factors of myxedema coma include:
* [[Hypothermia]], especially during winter months
* Metabolic disruption including [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyponatremia]], [[acidosis]], and [[hypercalcemia]]
* Respiratory compromise including [[hypoxemia]] and [[hypercapnia]]
* Infections including [[pneumonia]], [[cellulitis]], and [[urosepsis]]
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* [[Cerebrovascular accidents]]
* [[Gastrointestinal bleeding]]
* [[Major trauma|Trauma]], [[motor vehicle accidents]], and [[fractures]]
* Medications including [[anesthetics]], [[sedatives]], [[tranquilizers]], [[narcotics]], [[amiodarone]], and [[lithium]]
* Withdrawal of thyroid supplements, especially in relation to a hospitalization

Other precipitating factors include:
* Other medications including [[beta-blockers]], [[diuretics]], [[phenothiazines]], [[phenytoin]], [[rifampin]], [[TNF inhibitor|anti-TNF therapy]]
* [[Burn|Burns]]
* [[Influenza]]
* [[Surgery]]
* Consumption of raw [[bok choy]]
* [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] after total [[thyroidectomy]]

==Pathophysiology==
The [[thyroid gland]] is responsible for regulating whole-body metabolism through the production of two major hormones: [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3). Of the metabolically active thyroid hormones, 93% is T4 and 7% is T3. T3 is four times more potent than T4 and most T4 is converted to T3 in the tissues. [[Iodine]] is necessary for adequate hormone production. [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) is a circulating or serum hormone from the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4. [[Hypothyroidism]] occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough T3 and T4.<ref name="elshimy2022" />

The most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide is [[iodine deficiency|too little dietary iodine]]. [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine. With the cessation of the production of thyroid hormone, the thyroid gland contains enough reserve T3 and T4 to last 2 to 3 months.<ref name="elshimy2022" />

The thyroid hormones T3 and T4 influence the production by virtually all cells in the body of hundreds of new intracellular proteins and enzymes. This influence includes the expression of the [[calcium ATPase]], regulation of [[ion channels]], [[oxidative phosphorylation]], increased [[Sodium–potassium pump|Na-K-ATPase]] activity, increased carbohydrate metabolism, increased free fatty acids, increased vitamin requirements, and increased overall metabolism. The absence of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 are responsible for many bodily functions at the genetic and cellular level and an absence of these thyroid hormones as seen in myxedema coma has very serious consequences including a broad spectrum of symptoms and a high mortality rate.<ref name="elshimy2022" />

==Epidemiology==
Hypothyroidism is four times more common in women than men. The incidence of myxedema coma has been reported to be 0.22 per 1000000 per year but the data is limited and especially lacking in countries outside the western world and countries along the equator. Myxedema coma is most common in people 60 years old and older and is most common in the winter months when hypothermia is more common.<ref name="wall2000" /><ref name="mathew2011" /><ref name="elshimy2022" />
