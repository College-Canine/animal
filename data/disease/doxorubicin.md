== Side effects ==
===Cardiotoxicity===
The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], leading to [[congestive heart failure]]. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 18% when the dose is 551–600&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 36% when the dose exceeds 600&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Chaterjee">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatterjee K, Zhang J, Honbo N, Karliner JS | title = Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy | journal = Cardiology | volume = 115 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–162 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20016174 | pmc = 2848530 | doi = 10.1159/000265166 }}</ref> There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including [[oxidative stress]], downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and [[p53]]-mediated [[apoptosis]].<ref name=Chaterjee />

===Liposomal formulations===
<!-- Liposomal doxorubicin, Doxil, Caelyx, Myocet redirect here! -->
{{anchor|Liposomal form}}

There is a [[pegylated]] (polyethylene glycol coated) [[liposome]]-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, developed to treat [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] The [[polyethylene glycol]] coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called [[palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia]] (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome.

Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. In clinical testing at 50&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin.  This liposome-encapsulated form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.<ref name=Macmillan>{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |title=Liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, Myocet) |publisher=Macmillan Cancer Support |date=1 April 2009 |access-date=27 November 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129030936/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |archive-date=29 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |title=Doxorubicin liposomal |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |work=Chemocare |access-date=27 November 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102095755/http://chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |archive-date=2 January 2010 }}</ref>

A non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in the European Union and in Canada for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with [[cyclophosphamide]],<ref name="Myocet liposomal EPAR">{{cite web | title=Myocet liposomal EPAR | website=European Medicines Agency | date=17 September 2018 | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/myocet-liposomal-previously-myocet | access-date=20 June 2022 | archive-date=25 February 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225004945/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/myocet-liposomal-previously-myocet | url-status=live }} Text was copied from this source which is copyright European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged.</ref> but it has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of PPE. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as [[trastuzumab]]. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and [[paclitaxel]] can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in [[LVEF]] function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.<ref name=Macmillan/>

== Biosynthesis ==
{{main|Biosynthesis of doxorubicin}}
Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-[[hydroxylated]] version of [[daunorubicin]], the immediate precursor of DXR in its [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] pathway.

[[Daunorubicin]] is more abundantly found as a [[natural product]] because it is produced by a number of different [[wild type]] [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of ''[[Streptomyces]]''. In contrast, only one known non-[[wild type]] [[species]], ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'' [[subspecies]] ''cesius'' ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin.<ref name="pmid9864344">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lomovskaya N, Otten SL, Doi-Katayama Y, Fonstein L, Liu XC, Takatsu T, Inventi-Solari A, Filippini S, Torti F, Colombo AL, Hutchinson CR | display-authors = 6 | title = Doxorubicin overproduction in Streptomyces peucetius: cloning and characterization of the dnrU ketoreductase and dnrV genes and the doxA cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase gene | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 305–318 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9864344 | pmc = 103563 | doi = 10.1128/JB.181.1.305-318.1999 }}</ref> This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by [[mutation|mutating]] a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities.<ref name="pmid5365804">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arcamone F, Cassinelli G, Fantini G, Grein A, Orezzi P, Pol C, Spalla C | title = Adriamycin, 14-hydroxydaunomycin, a new antitumor antibiotic from S. peucetius var. caesius | journal = Biotechnology and Bioengineering | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1101–1110 | date = November 1969 | pmid = 5365804 | doi = 10.1002/bit.260110607 | s2cid = 21897153 }}</ref> Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of [[Modifications (genetics)|genetic modifications]], other strains of ''Streptomyces'' can produce doxorubicin.<ref name="pmid7828855">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grimm A, Madduri K, Ali A, Hutchinson CR | title = Characterization of the Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 29050 genes encoding doxorubicin polyketide synthase | journal = Gene | volume = 151 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–10 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7828855 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(94)90625-4 | doi-access = free }}</ref> His group also [[cloned]] many of the [[genes]] required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized.

By 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]], and found that it [[catalyzes]] multiple steps in DXR [[biosynthesis]], including steps leading to daunorubicin.<ref name="pmid9864343">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walczak RJ, Dickens ML, Priestley ND, Strohl WR | title = Purification, properties, and characterization of recombinant Streptomyces sp. strain C5 DoxA, a cytochrome P-450 catalyzing multiple steps in doxorubicin biosynthesis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 298–304 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9864343 | pmc = 103562 | doi = 10.1128/JB.181.1.298-304.1999 }}</ref> This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary [[genes]] to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding [[plasmids]], but also by introducing mutations to deactivate [[enzymes]] that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like [[glycosides]].<ref name="pmid9864344"/> Some triple mutants, that also [[gene expression|over-expressed]] dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225&nbsp;kg per annum.<ref name="pmid10455495">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchinson CR, Colombo AL | title = Genetic engineering of doxorubicin production in Streptomyces peucetius: a review | journal = Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 647–652 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10455495 | doi = 10.1038/sj.jim.2900673 | s2cid = 27337697 }}</ref>

More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the non[[liposomal]] formulation. Although DXR can be produced [[semisynthesis|semi-synthetically]] from daunorubicin, the process involves [[electrophilic]] [[bromination]] and multiple steps, and the yield is poor.<ref name="pmid8022857">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lown JW | title = Anthracycline and anthraquinone anticancer agents: current status and recent developments | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–214 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8022857 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(93)90006-Y }}</ref> Since daunorubicin is produced by [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], it would be ideal if the [[bacteria]] could complete DXR synthesis more effectively.

== History ==
[[File:Andria - Castel del Monte - 202209012324.jpg|thumb|right|Bacteria producing doxorubicin were originally discovered in soil near [[Castel del Monte, Apulia]].]]
{{see also|Anthracycline#History|Daunorubicin#History|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
In the 1950s, an Italian research company, [[Farmitalia]] Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the [[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]], a 13th-century castle. A new strain of ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'', which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound [[daunorubicin]], combining the name ''[[Dauni]]'', a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for [[ruby]], ''rubis'', describing the color.<ref name="weiss">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss RB | title = The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 670–686 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1462166 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baruffa G | title = Clinical trials in Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a long-acting sulphonamide | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 222–224 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5332105 | doi = 10.1016/0035-9203(66)90030-7 }}</ref><ref>Per prior citation, the first publication: Camerino B, Palamidessi G (1960) Derivati della parazina II.

Researchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of ''Streptomyces'' was mutated using ''N''-nitroso-''N''-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the [[Adriatic Sea]], and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention.<ref name="pmid5365804"/> Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors.

Doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the [[anthracycline]]s. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).<ref name="weiss"/> In 2016 GPX-150 was granted [[orphan drug]] designation by US FDA.<ref>[http://www.cancernetwork.com/sarcoma/investigational-sarcoma-drug-gpx-150-gets-orphan-drug-designation Investigational Sarcoma Drug GPX-150 Gets Orphan Drug Designation. 2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010110/http://www.cancernetwork.com/sarcoma/investigational-sarcoma-drug-gpx-150-gets-orphan-drug-designation |date=24 January 2016 }}</ref>

=== Fluorescence ===
Doxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent. This has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened the possibility of using the molecule as a [[theranostic]] agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent [[dielectric constant]] and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Karukstis KK, Thompson EH, Whiles JA, Rosenfeld RJ | title = Deciphering the fluorescence signature of daunomycin and doxorubicin | journal = Biophysical Chemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–263 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9700924 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-4622(98)00150-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohan P, Rapoport N | title = Doxorubicin as a molecular nanotheranostic agent: effect of doxorubicin encapsulation in micelles or nanoemulsions on the ultrasound-mediated intracellular delivery and nuclear trafficking | journal = Molecular Pharmaceutics | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 1959–1973 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20957997 | pmc = 2997862 | doi = 10.1021/mp100269f }}</ref>
