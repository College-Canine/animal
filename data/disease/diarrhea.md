== Terminology ==

The word diarrhea is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:διάρροια|διάρροια]]}} from {{lang|grc|διά}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|dia}}'' "through" and {{lang|grc|ῥέω}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|rheo}}'' "flow".

''Diarrhea'' is the spelling in [[American English]], whereas ''diarrhoea'' is the spelling in [[British English]].

Slang terms for the condition include "the runs", "the squirts" (or "squits" in Britain<ref>{{Wiktionary-inline|squits}}</ref>) and "the trots".<ref>{{Wiktionary-inline|runs}}</ref><ref>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diarrhea#synonyms|dictionary=[[Merriam Webster]]|title=Definition of Diarrhea by Merriam-Webster|access-date=11 December 2018|archive-date=11 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211052241/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diarrhea#synonyms|url-status=live}}</ref>
 
The word is often pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|i:|ə}} {{respell|DY|ə|REE|ə}}.

== Definition ==

Diarrhea is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as having three or more loose or liquid [[Defecation|stools]] per day, or as having more stools than is normal for that person.<ref name=WHO2013/>

Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days, by [[World Gastroenterology Organisation|World Gastroenterology Organization]].<ref name="WGO">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/acute-diarrhea-in-adults.html |title=WGO Practice Guideline – Acute diarrhea |access-date=9 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222012123/http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/acute-diarrhea-in-adults.html |archive-date=22 February 2011 }}</ref> Acute diarrhea that is watery may be known as AWD (Acute Watery Diarrhoea.)<ref>{{cite web |title=Cholera outbreak toobox |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/outbreak-toolkit/cholera-outbreak-data-collection-toolbox---layout-inis-27-june.pdf?sfvrsn=60036811_2 |publisher=WHO |access-date=2 May 2022 |date=June 2019 |archive-date=30 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220530170149/https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/outbreak-toolkit/cholera-outbreak-data-collection-toolbox---layout-inis-27-june.pdf?sfvrsn=60036811_2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Secretory===
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a [[cholera toxin]] that stimulates the secretion of [[anion]]s, especially [[chloride]] ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>). Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is [[Tonicity#3|isotonic]] with plasma even during fasting.<ref name="webmd.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |title=The Basics of Diarrhea |publisher=Webmd.com |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=9 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311010926/http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |archive-date=11 March 2011 }}</ref><ref name="MoonZhang2015"/> It continues even when there is no oral food intake.

===Osmotic===
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005>{{cite web|url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title = The Treatment Of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|version = Sometimes needs to be downloaded twice. See "4.2 Treatment Plan A: home therapy to prevent dehydration and malnutrition," "4.3 Treatment Plan B: oral rehydration therapy for children with some dehydration," and "4.4 Treatment Plan C: for patients with severe dehydration" on pages 8 to 16 (12–20 in PDF). See also "8. Management of Diarrhoea with Severe Malnutrition" on pages 22–24 (26–30 in PDF) and "Annex 2: Oral and Intravenous Rehydration Solutions" on pages 33–37 (37–41 in PDF).|year = 2005|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111019172153/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|archive-date = 19 October 2011|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="MoonZhang2015"/> Osmotic diarrhea can also result from maldigestion, e.g. pancreatic disease or [[coeliac disease]], in which the nutrients are left in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic [[laxatives]] (which work to alleviate [[constipation]] by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much [[magnesium]] or [[vitamin C]] or undigested [[lactose]] can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has [[lactose intolerance]] can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have [[fructose malabsorption]], excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. [[Sugar alcohol]]s such as [[sorbitol]] (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea.<ref name="webmd.com"/> In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent, e.g. milk or sorbitol, is stopped.

===Exudative===
Exudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with [[inflammatory bowel diseases]], such as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]], and other severe infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or other forms of food poisoning.<ref name="MoonZhang2015"/><ref name="webmd.com"/>

===Inflammatory===
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea can be found in this type of diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sweetser S | title = Evaluating the patient with diarrhea: a case-based approach | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 596–602 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22677080 | pmc = 3538472 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.02.015 }}</ref> It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.<ref name="MoonZhang2015"/>

===Dysentery===
If there is blood visible in the stools, it is also known as [[dysentery]]. The blood is a trace of an invasion of bowel tissue. Dysentery is a symptom of, among others, ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', and ''[[Salmonella]]''.<ref name="MoonZhang2015"/>

Diarrhea can cause [[electrolyte imbalance]]s, [[renal impairment|kidney impairment]], [[dehydration]], and defective [[immune system]] responses. When oral drugs are administered, the efficiency of the drug is to produce a [[therapeutic effect]] and the lack of this effect may be due to the medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in [[long term care facilities]] (nursing homes).<ref name="MoonZhang2015"/>

==Causes==
[[File:Stomach colon rectum diagram-en.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of the [[human gastrointestinal tract]]]]

In the latter stages of human digestion, ingested materials are inundated with water and digestive fluids such as [[gastric acid]], [[bile]], and [[digestive enzyme]]s in order to break them down into their nutrient components, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream via the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal tract]] in the small intestine. Prior to defecation, the large intestine reabsorbs the water and other digestive solvents in the waste product in order to maintain proper hydration and overall equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Maton A, Hopkins J, McLaughlin CM, Johnson S, Warner MQ, LaHart D, Wright JD | title = Human Biology and Health| publisher = Prentice Hall| year = 1993| location = Englewood Cliffs, NJ| isbn = 978-0-13-981176-0| oclc = 32308337| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/humanbiologyheal00scho}}</ref> Diarrhea occurs when the large intestine is prevented, for any number of reasons, from sufficiently absorbing the water or other digestive fluids from fecal matter, resulting in a liquid, or "loose", bowel movement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Diarrhea: Types, Causes, Complications & Treatment |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=Cleveland Clinic |archive-date=19 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220719133818/https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[acute (medicine)|Acute]] diarrhea is most commonly due to viral [[gastroenteritis]] with [[rotavirus]], which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five.<ref name=WHO2010a/> In [[traveler's diarrhea|travelers]], however, [[bacterial infections]] predominate.<ref name="pmid16267716"/> Various toxins such as [[Amanita phalloides#Signs and symptoms|mushroom poisoning]] and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea.

Chronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[microscopic colitis]], [[celiac disease]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], and [[bile acid malabsorption]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Microscopic colitis - Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/microscopic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351478 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=Mayo Clinic |language=en |archive-date=3 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220403123231/https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/microscopic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351478 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[Campylobacter]]'' [[species|spp.]] are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp., ''[[Shigella]]'' spp. and some strains of ''Escherichia coli'' are also a frequent cause.<ref name="pmid19116615">{{cite journal | vauthors = Viswanathan VK, Hodges K, Hecht G | title = Enteric infection meets intestinal function: how bacterial pathogens cause diarrhoea | journal = Nature Reviews.

In the elderly, particularly those who have been treated with antibiotics for unrelated infections, a toxin produced by ''[[Clostridioides difficile (bacteria)|Clostridioides difficile]]'' often causes severe diarrhea.<ref name="pmid19528959">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rupnik M, Wilcox MH, Gerding DN | s2cid = 23376891 | title = Clostridium difficile infection: new developments in epidemiology and pathogenesis | journal = Nature Reviews.

Parasites, particularly [[protozoa]] e.g., ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' spp., ''[[Giardia]]'' spp., ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Blastocystis]]'' spp., ''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'', are frequently the cause of diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent [[nitazoxanide]] has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.<ref name="pmid22301075">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossignol JF, Lopez-Chegne N, Julcamoro LM, Carrion ME, Bardin MC | title = Nitazoxanide for the empiric treatment of pediatric infectious diarrhea | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–73 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22301075 | doi = 10.1016/j.trstmh.2011.11.007 }}</ref>

====Sanitation====
[[File:Slum and dirty river.jpg|thumb|Poverty often leads to unhygienic living conditions, as in this community in the Indian Himalayas. Such conditions promote contraction of diarrheal diseases, as a result of poor [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]].]]
[[Open defecation]] is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea leading to death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Diarrhoeal disease |publisher=Who.int |access-date=10 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401193648/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/ |archive-date=1 April 2014 }}</ref>

Poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population. This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live. The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea. "Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste ([[sanitation]]), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea{{nbsp}}... Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses. The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care."<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Jamison DT |title=Disease control priorities in developing countries|date=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8213-6179-5 |edition=2nd}}</ref>

One of the most common causes of infectious diarrhea is a lack of clean water. Often, improper fecal disposal leads to contamination of groundwater. This can lead to widespread infection among a population, especially in the absence of water filtration or purification. Human feces contains a variety of potentially harmful human [[pathogens]].<ref name="Brown 629–34">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown J, Cairncross S, Ensink JH | title = Water, sanitation, hygiene and enteric infections in children | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 98 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–34 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23761692 | pmc = 3717778 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2011-301528 }}</ref>

====Nutrition====
Proper nutrition is important for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system. [[Zinc deficiency]], a condition often found in children in [[developing countries]] can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE, Sazawal S | title = Zinc and childhood infectious disease morbidity and mortality | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 85 | pages = S125-9 | date = May 2001 | issue = Suppl 2 | pmid = 11509100 | doi = 10.1079/bjn2000304 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shankar AH, Prasad AS | title = Zinc and immune function: the biological basis of altered resistance to infection | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 68 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 447S–463S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9701160 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/68.2.447S | doi-access = free }}</ref> Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bahl R, Bhandari N, Hambidge KM, Bhan MK | title = Plasma zinc as a predictor of diarrheal and respiratory morbidity in children in an urban slum setting | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 68 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 414S–417S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9701154 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/68.2.414S | doi-access = free }}</ref> Similarly, [[vitamin A deficiency]] can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status,<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rice AL, West KP, Black RE | chapter = Vitamin A deficiency | veditors = Ezzati M, Lopez AD, Rodgers A, Murray CJ | title = Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributes to selected major risk factors. | location = Geneva | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 2004 | volume = 1 | pages = 211–56, especially 238–240 | chapter-url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42792/9241580348_eng_Volume1.pdf | access-date = 30 December 2018 | archive-date = 31 July 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200731084243/https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42792/9241580348_eng_Volume1.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> Others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer A, Katz J, Tarwotjo I | title = Increased risk of respiratory disease and diarrhea in children with preexisting mild vitamin A deficiency | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1090–5 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6496388 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/40.5.1090 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West KP | title = Extent of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children and women of reproductive age | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 132 | issue = 9 Suppl | pages = 2857S–2866S | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12221262 | doi = 10.1093/jn/132.9.2857S | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Malabsorption===
{{Main|Malabsorption}}
[[Malabsorption]] is the inability to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the [[pancreas]].

Causes include:{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}
* ''enzyme deficiencies or mucosal abnormality'', as in [[food allergy]] and [[food intolerance]], e.g. [[celiac disease]] (gluten intolerance), [[lactose intolerance]] (intolerance to milk sugar, common in non-Europeans), and [[fructose malabsorption]].
* ''[[pernicious anemia]]'', or impaired bowel function due to the inability to absorb [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]],
* ''loss of pancreatic secretions'', which may be due to [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[pancreatitis]],
* ''structural defects'', like [[short bowel syndrome]] (surgically removed bowel) and radiation fibrosis, such as usually follows cancer treatment and other drugs, including agents used in [[chemotherapy]]; and
* ''certain drugs'', like [[orlistat]], which inhibits the absorption of fat.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
{{Main|Inflammatory bowel disease}}
The two overlapping types here are of unknown origin:
* [[Ulcerative colitis]] is marked by chronic bloody diarrhea and inflammation mostly affects the distal [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] near the [[rectum]].
* [[Crohn's disease]] typically affects fairly well demarcated segments of bowel in the colon and often affects the end of the small bowel.

===Irritable bowel syndrome===
{{Main|Irritable bowel syndrome}}
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by [[defecation]] and unusual [[Human feces|stool]] (diarrhea or [[constipation]]) for at least three days a week over the previous three months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Longstreth GF, Thompson WG, Chey WD, Houghton LA, Mearin F, Spiller RC | title = Functional bowel disorders | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 1480–91 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16678561 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.061 }}</ref> Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as [[loperamide]] or [[codeine]]. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have [[bile acid malabsorption]] diagnosed with an abnormal [[SeHCAT]] test.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wedlake L, A'Hern R, Russell D, Thomas K, Walters JR, Andreyev HJ | title = Systematic review: the prevalence of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption as diagnosed by SeHCAT scanning in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 707–17 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19570102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04081.x | s2cid = 11327665 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Other diseases===

* Certain medications<ref name="pmid26576135"/>
* [[Bile acid malabsorption]]<ref name="pmid26576135"/>
* [[Ischemia|Ischemic]] bowel disease: This usually affects older people and can be due to blocked arteries.
* [[Microscopic colitis]], a type of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] where changes are seen only on histological examination of colonic biopsies.
* [[Bile salt malabsorption]] ([[primary bile acid diarrhea]]) where excessive [[bile acids]] in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] produce a secretory diarrhea.
* Hormone-secreting tumors: some hormones, e.g. [[serotonin]], can cause diarrhea if secreted in excess (usually from a tumor).
* Chronic mild diarrhea in infants and toddlers may occur with no obvious cause and with no other ill effects; this condition is called [[toddler's diarrhea]].
* [[Environmental enteropathy]]
* [[Radiation enteropathy]] following treatment for pelvic and abdominal cancers.

===Medications===

===Evolution===
According to two researchers, [[Randolph M. Nesse|Nesse]] and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams]], diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Williams G, Nesse RM |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=36–38 |isbn=978-0-679-74674-4 }}</ref> They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating ''[[Shigella]]'' with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, [[Lomotil]]) caused people to stay [[fever]]ish twice as long as those not so treated. The researchers indeed themselves observed that: "Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis. Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DuPont HL, Hornick RB | title = Adverse effect of lomotil therapy in shigellosis | journal = JAMA | volume = 226 | issue = 13 | pages = 1525–8 | date = December 1973 | pmid = 4587313 | doi = 10.1001/jama.226.13.1525 }}</ref>

== Diagnostic approach ==

The following types of diarrhea may indicate further investigation is needed:

* In infants
* Moderate or severe diarrhea in young children
* Associated with blood
* Continues for more than two days
* Associated non-cramping [[abdominal pain]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]], etc.
* In [[Traveler's diarrhea|travelers]]
* In food handlers, because of the potential to infect others;
* In institutions such as hospitals, child care centers, or geriatric and convalescent homes.

A severity score is used to aid diagnosis in children.<ref name="pmid2371542">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruuska T, Vesikari T | title = Rotavirus disease in Finnish children: use of numerical scores for clinical severity of diarrhoeal episodes | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 259–67 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2371542 | doi = 10.3109/00365549009027046 }}</ref>

When diarrhea lasts for more than four weeks a number of further tests may be recommended including:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arasaradnam RP, Brown S, Forbes A, Fox MR, Hungin P, Kelman L, Major G, O'Connor M, Sanders DS, Sinha R, Smith SC, Thomas P, Walters JR | title = Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition | journal = Gut | volume = 67 | issue = 8 | pages = 1380–1399 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29653941 | pmc = 6204957 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315909 }}</ref>

* [[Complete blood count]] and a [[ferritin]] if [[anemia]] is present
* [[Thyroid stimulating hormone]]
* [[Tissue transglutaminase]] for [[celiac disease]]
* Fecal [[calprotectin]] to exclude [[inflammatory bowel disease]]
* [[Stool test]]s for ova and parasites as well as for ''[[Clostridioides difficile (bacteria)|Clostridioides difficile]]''
* A [[colonoscopy]] or fecal immunochemical testing for cancer, including biopsies to detect [[microscopic colitis]]
* Testing for [[bile acid diarrhea]] with [[SeHCAT]], [[7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one]] or fecal [[bile acids]] depending on availability
* [[Hydrogen breath test]] looking for [[lactose intolerance]]
* Further tests if [[immunodeficiency]], [[pelvic radiation disease]] or [[small intestinal bacterial overgrowth]] suspected.

A 2019 guideline recommended that testing for ova and parasites was only needed in people who are at high risk though they recommend routine testing for [[giardia]].<ref name=Sma2019>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smalley W, Falck-Ytter C, Carrasco-Labra A, Wani S, Lytvyn L, Falck-Ytter Y | title = AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Laboratory Evaluation of Functional Diarrhea and Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Adults (IBS-D) | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 157 | issue = 3 | pages = 851–854 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31302098 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2019.07.004 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) and [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) were not recommended.<ref name=Sma2019/>

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
{{Further|WASH#Health aspects}}
Numerous studies have shown that improvements in drinking water and sanitation ([[WASH]]) lead to decreased risks of diarrhoea.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf J, Prüss-Ustün A, Cumming O, Bartram J, Bonjour S, Cairncross S, Clasen T, Colford JM, Curtis V, De France J, Fewtrell L, Freeman MC, Gordon B, Hunter PR, Jeandron A, Johnston RB, Mäusezahl D, Mathers C, Neira M, Higgins JP | title = Assessing the impact of drinking water and sanitation on diarrhoeal disease in low- and middle-income settings: systematic review and meta-regression | journal = Tropical Medicine & International Health | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 928–42 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24811732 | doi = 10.1111/tmi.12331 | s2cid = 22903164 | url = https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/51912/1/Wolf_2014_Assessing_impact_of_drinking_water.pdf | doi-access = free | access-date = 17 December 2019 | archive-date = 13 April 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200413184758/https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/51912/1/Wolf_2014_Assessing_impact_of_drinking_water.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> Such improvements might include for example use of water filters, provision of high-quality [[drinking water|piped water]] and [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] connections.<ref name=":0" />

====Hand washing====
Basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease. The implementation of hand washing using soap and water, for example, has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 30–48%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis V, Cairncross S | title = Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 275–81 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12726975 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cairncross S, Hunt C, Boisson S, Bostoen K, Curtis V, Fung IC, Schmidt WP | title = Water, sanitation and hygiene for the prevention of diarrhoea | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 39 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = i193-205 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20348121 | pmc = 2845874 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq035 }}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Hand washing in developing countries, however, is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]: "Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world; however, access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries. This lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries." Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diarrheal Diseases in Less Developed Countries|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/ldc/diarrheal_diseases.html|work=CDC|access-date=28 October 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104042634/http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/ldc/diarrheal_diseases.html|archive-date=4 November 2013}}</ref>

====Water====
Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean [[water supply]] and [[improved sanitation]] have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene.<ref name="Brown 629–34"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE, Morris SS, Bryce J | s2cid = 14509705 | title = Where and why are 10 million children dying every year? | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9376 | pages = 2226–34 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12842379 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13779-8 }}</ref> Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Esrey SA, Feachem RG, Hughes JM | title = Interventions for the control of diarrhoeal diseases among young children: improving water supplies and excreta disposal facilities | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 757–72 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3878742 | pmc = 2536385 }}</ref>

Chlorine treatment of water, for example, has been shown to reduce both the risk of diarrheal disease, and of contamination of stored water with diarrheal pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold BF, Colford JM | title = Treating water with chlorine at point-of-use to improve water quality and reduce child diarrhea in developing countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 354–64 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17297049 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.2007.76.354 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Vaccination===
Immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2–3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6–10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Zoysa I, Feachem RG | title = Interventions for the control of diarrhoeal diseases among young children: rotavirus and cholera immunization | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 569–83 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3876173 | pmc = 2536413 }}</ref> Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rheingans RD, Antil L, Dreibelbis R, Podewils LJ, Bresee JS, Parashar UD | title = Economic costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 200 | pages = S16-27 | date = November 2009 | issue = Suppl 1 | pmid = 19817595 | doi = 10.1086/605026 | doi-access = free | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Rheingans_Richard_2009_Economic_Costs_of_Rotavirus_orig.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Oral cholera vaccines in mass immunization campaigns |year=2010 |publisher=WHO |isbn=978-92-4-150043-2 |pages=6–8 |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241500432_eng.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140903045312/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241500432_eng.pdf |archive-date=3 September 2014 }}</ref>

===Nutrition===
Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices. Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE | title = Zinc deficiency, infectious disease and mortality in the developing world | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 5 Suppl 1 | pages = 1485S–9S | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12730449 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.5.1485S | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhutta ZA, Black RE, Brown KH, Gardner JM, Gore S, Hidayat A, Khatun F, Martorell R, Ninh NX, Penny ME, Rosado JL, Roy SK, Ruel M, Sazawal S, Shankar A | title = Prevention of diarrhea and pneumonia by zinc supplementation in children in developing countries: pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials.

====Breastfeeding====
Breastfeeding practices have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence of diarrheal disease in poor populations. Studies across a number of developing nations have shown that those who receive [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during their first 6 months of life are better protected against infection with diarrheal diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | s2cid = 30952224 | title = Effect of breastfeeding on infant and child mortality due to infectious diseases in less developed countries: a pooled analysis.

==Management==
In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – [[oral rehydration therapy]] – or, in severe cases, [[intravenously]].<ref name=WHO2010a/> Diet restrictions such as the [[BRAT diet]] are no longer recommended.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = King CK, Glass R, Bresee JS, Duggan C | title = Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy | journal = MMWR.

===Fluids===
{{See also|Management of dehydration}}
[[File:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|A person consuming oral rehydration solution]]
[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration solution (ORS)]] (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> There are commercial solutions such as [[Pedialyte]], and relief agencies such as [[UNICEF]] widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> (approximately the "taste of tears"<ref name=2010WorldCupTravellersGuide>[https://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf A Guide on Safe Food for Travellers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709034248/http://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf |date=9 July 2012 }}, Welcome to South Africa, Host to the 2010 FIFA World Cup (bottom left of page 1).</ref>).

Appropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration. As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.<ref name=CDCmanualCholera>[https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020070810/http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf |date=20 October 2011 }}, CDC, slides at back are dated 17 November 2010. Page 7 states "...{{nbsp}} Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently."</ref>

Vomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>

Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as [[soft drinks]] and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five as they may ''increase'' dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/><ref name=NICE2009>{{cite web|title=Management of acute diarrhoea and vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children under 5|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG84|work=National Institute of Clinical Excellence|date=April 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802094158/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG84|archive-date=2 August 2009}}</ref> Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable.<ref name=NICE2009/> Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> A [[nasogastric tube]] can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.<ref name=Webb2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb A, Starr M | title = Acute gastroenteritis in children | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–31 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15861741 }}</ref>

===Eating===
The WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly. The WHO states "Food should ''never'' be withheld and the child's usual foods should ''not'' be diluted. Breastfeeding should ''always'' be continued."<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> In the specific example of cholera, the CDC makes the same recommendation.<ref name = CDCmanualCholera/> Breast-fed infants with diarrhea often choose to breastfeed more, and should be encouraged to do so.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world, a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = MacGillivray S, Fahey T, McGuire W | title = Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = CD005433 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24173771 | pmc = 4276385 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005433.pub2 }}</ref>
Eating food containing [[soluble fibre]] may help, but insoluble fibre might make it worse.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/chronic-diarrhea-16/diarrhea-more-fiber |title=The Facts About Fiber |access-date=25 January 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727012104/https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/chronic-diarrhea-16/diarrhea-more-fiber |url-status=deviated }}</ref>

===Medications===
{{Main article|Antidiarrhoeal}}
Antidiarrheal  agents  can  be  classified  into  four  different groups: antimotility, antisecretory, adsorbent, and anti-infectious.<ref name=Diosmectite2009>{{cite journal | vauthors=Guarino A, Lo Vecchio A, Pirozzi MR |s2cid=56519371 |title=Clinical role of diosmectite in the management of diarrhea. |journal=Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol |date=2009 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=433–440 |doi=10.1517/17425250902865594|pmid=19379128 }}</ref> While [[antibiotic]]s are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden MS, Gabb RJ, Wright SK | title = Empirical treatment of severe acute community-acquired gastroenteritis with ciprofloxacin | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1019–25 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8783703 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/22.6.1019 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=CE08/> There are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]] in people infected with [[Escherichia coli O157:H7]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CS, Jelacic S, Habeeb RL, Watkins SL, Tarr PI | title = The risk of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome after antibiotic treatment of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 342 | issue = 26 | pages = 1930–6 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10874060 | pmc = 3659814 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200006293422601 }}</ref> In resource-poor countries, treatment with antibiotics may be beneficial.<ref name=CE08>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Bruyn G | title = Diarrhoea in adults (acute) | journal = BMJ Clinical Evidence | volume = 2008 | pages = 0901 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 19450323 | pmc = 2907942 }}</ref> However, some bacteria are developing [[antibiotic resistance]], particularly ''Shigella''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html |title=Diarrhoeal Diseases |date=February 2009 |work=World Health Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215123745/http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html |archive-date=15 December 2008 }}</ref> Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, and [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea]] is the most common adverse effect of treatment with general antibiotics.

While bismuth compounds ([[Pepto-Bismol]]) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DuPont HL, Ericsson CD, Farthing MJ, Gorbach S, Pickering LK, Rombo L, Steffen R, Weinke T | title = Expert review of the evidence base for self-therapy of travelers' diarrhea | journal = Journal of Travel Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–71 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19538576 | doi = 10.1111/j.1708-8305.2009.00300.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Anti-motility agents like [[loperamide]] are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease.<ref name=NEJM2014/> These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawlowski SW, Warren CA, Guerrant R | title = Diagnosis and treatment of acute or persistent diarrhea | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 136 | issue = 6 | pages = 1874–86 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19457416 | pmc = 2723735 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.02.072 }}</ref>

[[Diosmectite]], a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupont C, Vernisse B | title = Anti-diarrheal effects of diosmectite in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a review | journal = Paediatric Drugs | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–99 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19301931 | doi = 10.2165/00148581-200911020-00001 | pmc = 7100234 }}</ref> and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.<ref name="pmid26576135"/> Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is [[kaopectate]].

[[Racecadotril]] an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and  adults.<ref name=Diosmectite2009/> It has better tolerability than [[loperamide]], as it causes less [[constipation]] and [[flatulence]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile| year = 1982 | veditors = Dinnendahl V, Fricke U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=de}}</ref> However, it has little benefit in improving acute diarrhea in children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang Y, Zhang L, Zeng L, Gordon M, Wen J | title = Racecadotril for acute diarrhoea in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | pages = CD009359 | date = December 2019 | issue = 12 | pmid = 31858591 | pmc = 6923519 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009359.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group }}</ref>

[[Bile acid sequestrants]] such as [[cholestyramine]] can be effective in chronic diarrhea due to [[bile acid malabsorption]]. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as [[SeHCAT]] retention.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilcox C, Turner J, Green J | title = Systematic review: the management of chronic diarrhoea due to bile acid malabsorption | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 923–39 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24602022 | doi = 10.1111/apt.12684 | s2cid = 12016216 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Alternative therapies===
Zinc supplementation may benefit children over six months old with diarrhea in areas with high rates of malnourishment or zinc deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazzerini M, Wanzira H | title = Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD005436 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27996088 | pmc = 5450879 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005436.pub5 }}</ref> This supports the World Health Organization guidelines for zinc, but not in the very young.

A Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that [[probiotic]]s make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration.<ref name="pmid33295643">{{cite journal | vauthors = Collinson S, Deans A, Padua-Zamora A, Gregorio GV, Li C, Dans LF, Allen SJ | title = Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2020 | issue = 12| pages = CD003048 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 33295643 | pmc = 8166250 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003048.pub4 }}</ref> The [[probiotic]] [[lactobacillus]] can help prevent [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea]] in adults but possibly not children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kale-Pradhan PB, Jassal HK, Wilhelm SM | title = Role of Lactobacillus in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–26 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20099986 | doi = 10.1592/phco.30.2.119 | s2cid = 21836205 }}</ref> For those with [[lactose intolerance]], taking digestive [[enzyme]]s containing [[lactase]] when consuming dairy products often improves symptoms.
