'''Gastric dilatation volvulus''' ('''GDV'''), also known as '''gastric dilation''', '''twisted stomach''', or '''gastric torsion''', is a [[medical condition]] that affects dogs in which the [[stomach]] becomes overstretched and rotated by excessive [[gas]] content. The word '''bloat''' is often used as a general term to mean [[Abdominal distension|gas distension]] without stomach torsion (a normal change after eating), or to refer to GDV.

GDV is a life-threatening condition in dogs that requires prompt treatment. It is common in certain breeds; deep-chested breeds are especially at risk. [[Mortality rate]]s in dogs range from 10 to 60%, even with treatment.<ref name="Aronson_2000">{{cite journal|author=Aronson, Lillian R.|author2=Brockman, Daniel J. |author3=Brown, Dorothy Cimino |title=Gastrointestinal Emergencies|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America|year=2000|volume=30|issue=1 |pages=558–569|doi=10.1016/s0195-5616(00)50039-4|pmid=10853276 |pmc=1374121}}</ref> With surgery, the mortality rate is 15 to 33 percent.<ref name="Beck">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beck J, Staatz A, Pelsue D, Kudnig S, MacPhail C, Seim H, Monnet E |title=Risk factors associated with short-term outcome and development of perioperative complications in dogs undergoing surgery because of gastric dilatation-volvulus: 166 cases (1992-2003) |journal=J.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms are not necessarily distinguishable from other kinds of distress. A dog might stand uncomfortably and seem to be in extreme discomfort for no apparent reason. Other possible symptoms include firm distension of the [[abdomen]], weakness, depression, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation, and retching without producing any vomitus (nonproductive vomiting). Many dogs with GDV have cardiac [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s (40% in one study).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brockman D, Washabau R, Drobatz K |title=Canine gastric dilatation/volvulus syndrome in a veterinary critical care unit: 295 cases (1986-1992) |journal=J.

==Causes==
Gastric dilatation volvulus in dogs is likely caused by a multitude of factors, but in all cases the immediate prerequisite is a dysfunction of the [[sphincter]] between the [[esophagus]] and stomach and an obstruction of outflow through the [[pylorus]].<ref name=Parton>{{cite journal |vauthors=Parton A, Volk S, Weisse C |title=Gastric ulceration subsequent to partial invagination of the stomach in a dog with gastric dilatation-volvulus |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=228 |issue=12 |pages=1895–900 |year=2006 |pmid=16784379 |doi=10.2460/javma.228.12.1895}}</ref> Some of the more widely acknowledged factors for developing GDV include increased age, breed, having a deep and narrow chest, eating foods, such as kibble, that expand in the stomach, overfeeding, too much water consumption in a small period of time before or after exercise, and other causes of gastrointestinal disease and distress. The risk of bloat in dogs perceived as happy by their owners is decreased, and increased in dogs perceived as fearful. This may be owing to the [[physiology|physiological]] effects of the dog's personality on the function and motility of the gastrointestinal system.<ref name="Glickman 2000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Glickman N, Schellenberg D, Raghavan M, Lee T |title=Incidence of and breed-related risk factors for gastric dilatation-volvulus in dogs |journal=J.

Dogs with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] may be at an increased risk for bloat.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Braun L, Lester S, Kuzma A, Hosie S |title=Gastric dilatation-volvulus in the dog with histological evidence of preexisting inflammatory bowel disease: a retrospective study of 23 cases |journal=[[Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=287–90 |year=1996 |pmid=8784718 |doi=10.5326/15473317-32-4-287}}</ref>

===Dietary factors===
One common recommendation in the past has been to raise the food bowl of dogs when they eat, but this may actually increase the risk of GDV.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Glickman N, Schellenberg D, Raghavan M, Lee T |s2cid=22006972 |title=Non-dietary risk factors for gastric dilatation-volvulus in large and giant breed dogs |journal=J.

==Pathophysiology==
The stomach twists around the longitudinal axis of the digestive tract, also known as '''volvulus'''. Gas distension may occur prior to or after the stomach twists.<ref name=Parton/> The most common direction for rotation is clockwise, viewing the animal from behind. The stomach can rotate up to 360° in this direction and 90° counterclockwise. If the volvulus is greater than 180°, the [[esophagus]] is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or vomiting.<ref name=Merck/> The results of this distortion of normal anatomy and gas distension include [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), decreased return of blood to the heart, [[ischemia]] (loss of blood supply) of the stomach, and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Pressure on the [[portal vein]] decreases blood flow to liver and decreases the ability of that organ to remove toxins and absorbed bacteria from the blood.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bright | first = Ronald M. | title = Gastric dilatation-volvulus: risk factors and some new minimally invasive gastropexy techniques | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8763&O=Generic | access-date = 2007-04-17 }}</ref> At the other end of the stomach, the [[spleen]] may be damaged if the twisting interrupts its blood supply. If not quickly treated, bloat can lead to [[blood poisoning]], [[peritonitis]], and death by [[toxic shock]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:GDV x-ray.JPG|thumb|Bloat in a dog, with "double-bubble" sign]]
A diagnosis of GDV is made by several factors. The breed and history often gives a significant suspicion of the  condition, and a physical examination often reveals the telltale sign of a distended abdomen with abdominal [[tympany]]. Shock is diagnosed by the presence of pale [[mucous membrane]]s with poor [[capillary]] refill, increased heart rate, and poor [[pulse]] quality. [[Radiography|Radiographs]] (X-rays), usually taken after decompression of the stomach if the dog is unstable, shows a stomach distended with gas. The pylorus, which normally is [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] and to the right of the body of the stomach, is [[Anatomical terms of location|cranial]] to the body of the stomach and left of the midline, often separated on the X-ray by soft tissue and giving the appearance of a separate gas-filled pocket (double-bubble sign).<ref name=Fossum/>

==Treatment==
Gastric dilatation volvulus is an emergency medical condition; having the animal examined by a [[veterinarian]] is imperative. GDV can become fatal within a matter of minutes.

Treatment usually involves resuscitation with [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid therapy]], usually a combination of [[isotonic solutions|isotonic fluids]] and [[hypertonic saline]] or a [[colloid]]al solution such as [[hetastarch]], and emergency [[surgery]]. The stomach is initially decompressed by passing a stomach tube, or if that is not possible, [[trocar]]s can be passed through the skin into the stomach to remove the gas, alternatively the trocars may be inserted directly into the stomach following anaesthesia  to reduce the chances of infection. During surgery, the stomach is placed back into its correct position, and the abdomen is examined for any devitalized tissue (especially the stomach and spleen). A partial [[gastrectomy]] may be necessary if  any [[necrosis]] of the stomach wall occurs.

==Prevention==
Recurrence of GDV attacks can be a problem, occurring in up to 80% of dogs treated medically only (without surgery).<ref name=Rawlings>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rawlings C, Mahaffey M, Bement S, Canalis C |title=Prospective evaluation of laparoscopic-assisted gastropexy in dogs susceptible to gastric dilatation |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=221 |issue=11 |pages=1576–81 |year=2002 |pmid=12479327 |doi=10.2460/javma.2002.221.1576}}</ref> To prevent recurrence, at the same time the bloat is treated surgically, a right-side [[Canine gastropexy|gastropexy]] is often performed, which by a variety of methods firmly attaches the stomach wall to the body wall, to prevent it from twisting inside the abdominal cavity in the future. While dogs that have had gastropexies still may develop gas distension of the stomach,  a significant reduction in recurrence of gastric volvulus is seen. Of 136 dogs that had surgery for gastric dilatation-volvulus, six that did have gastropexies had a recurrence, while 74 (54.5%) of those without the additional surgery recurred.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Lantz G, Schellenberg D, Glickman N |title=A prospective study of survival and recurrence following the acute gastric dilatation-volvulus syndrome in 136 dogs |journal=[[Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=253–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9590454 |doi=10.5326/15473317-34-3-253}}</ref> Gastropexies are also performed [[prophylaxis|prophylactically]] in dogs considered to be at high risk of GDV, including dogs with previous episodes  or with gastrointestinal disease predisposing to GDV, and dogs with a first-order relative (parent or sibling) with a history of it.<ref name=Rawlings/>

Precautions that are likely to help prevent gastric dilatation-volvulus include feeding small meals throughout the day instead of one big meal, and not exercising immediately before or after a meal.<ref name=Wingfield>{{cite book | last = Wingfield | first = Wayne E. | title = Veterinary Emergency Medicine Secrets | publisher = Hanley & Belfus, Inc | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-1-56053-215-6 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Immediate treatment is the most important factor in a favorable prognosis. A delay in treatment greater than 6 hours or the presence of [[peritonitis]], [[sepsis]], [[hypotension]], or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] are negative prognostic indicators.<ref name=Beck/>

Historically, GDV has held a guarded prognosis.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://marylandpetemergency.com/canine-bloat-gdv.html| website= marylandpetemergency.com| title= Canine Bloat: Gastric Dilatation and Volvulus (GDV): 'The Mother of All Emergencies'| publisher= Animal Emergency Hospital | access-date= October 15, 2017}}</ref> Although "early studies showed mortality rates between 33 and 68% for dogs with GDV," studies from 2007 to 2012 "reported mortality rates between 10 and 26.8%".<ref>{{cite journal| journal= Can Vet J | date= October 2014| volume= 55| number= 10| pages= 981–984| pmc= 4187373| title= Occurrence and recurrence of gastric dilatation with or without volvulus after incisional gastropexy| first1= John F.| last1= Przywara| first2= Steven B.| last2= Abel| first3= John T.| last3= Peacock| first4= Susan| last4= Shott| pmid=25320388}}</ref> Mortality rates approach 10 to 40% even with treatment.<ref name= "ASPCA bloat">{{cite web| url= http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/bloat | title= Bloat| website= aspca.org| publisher= [[The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140701044216/http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/bloat| url-status= dead| archive-date= July 1, 2014| access-date= 15 October 2017}}</ref> With prompt treatment and good preoperative stabilization of the patient, mortality is significantly lessened to 10% overall (in a referral setting).<ref name= "retro 306">{{cite journal | title = A retrospective study of factors influencing survival following surgery for gastric dilatation-volvulus syndrome in 306 dogs | vauthors= Mackenzie G, Barnhart M, Kennedy S, DeHoff W, Schertel E| journal = [[Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association]] | volume = 46| number= 2 | date= March–April 2010 | pages = 97–102 | pmid= 20194364| doi= 10.5326/0460097}}</ref> Negative prognostic indicators following surgical intervention include postoperative [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[splenectomy]], or splenectomy with partial [[gastric resection]].

==Epidemiology==
As a general rule, GDV is of greatest risk to deep-chested dogs. The five breeds at greatest risk are [[Great Dane]]s, [[Weimaraner]]s, [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernards]], [[Gordon Setter]]s, and [[Irish Setter]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Glickman N, Pérez C, Schellenberg D, Lantz G |title=Analysis of risk factors for gastric dilatation and dilatation-volvulus in dogs |journal=J.
