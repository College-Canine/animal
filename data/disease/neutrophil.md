'''Neutrophils''' (also known as '''neutrocytes''', '''heterophils''' or '''polymorphonuclear leukocytes''') are a type of [[white blood cell]].

Neutrophils will show increasing segmentation (many segments of the nucleus) as they mature. A normal neutrophil should have 3–5 segments. Hypersegmentation is not normal but occurs in some disorders, most notably [[Vitamin B-12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]]. This is noted in a manual review of the blood smear and is positive when most or all of the neutrophils have 5 or more segments.

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the human body (approximately 10<sup>11</sup> are produced daily); they account for approximately 50–70% of all white blood cells (leukocytes). The stated normal range for human blood counts varies between laboratories, but a neutrophil count of 2.5–7.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L is a standard normal range.

The capacity of neutrophils to engulf bacteria is reduced when simple sugars like glucose, fructose as well as sucrose, honey and orange juice were ingested, while the ingestion of starches had no effect. Fasting, on the other hand, strengthened the neutrophils' phagocytic capacity to engulf bacteria. It was concluded that the function, and not the number, of phagocytes in engulfing bacteria was altered by the ingestion of sugars.<ref name =neutrop2013091>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanchez A, Reeser JL, Lau HS, Yahiku PY, Willard RE, McMillan PJ, Cho SY, Magie AR, Register UD | title = Role of sugars in human neutrophilic phagocytosis | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 1180–1184 | date = November 1973 | pmid = 4748178 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/26.11.1180 | quote = These data suggest that the function and not the number of phagocytes was altered by ingestion of sugars.

Upon activation, they marginate (position themselves adjacent to the blood vessel endothelium) and undergo [[selectin]]-dependent capture followed by [[integrin]]-dependent adhesion in most cases, after which they migrate into tissues, where they survive for 1–2 days.<ref name=Wheater/> Neutrophils have also been demonstrated to be released into the blood from a [[splenic]] reserve following [[myocardial infarction]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Akbar N, Braithwaite AT, Corr EM, Koelwyn GJ, van Solingen C, Cochain C, Saliba AE, Corbin A, Pezzolla D, Møller Jørgensen M, Bæk R, Edgar L, De Villiers C, Gunadasa-Rohling M, Banerjee A, Paget D, Lee C, Hogg E, Costin A, Dhaliwal R, Johnson E, Krausgruber T, Riepsaame J, Melling GE, Shanmuganathan M, Bock C, Carter DR, Channon KM, Riley PR, Udalova IA, Moore KJ, Anthony DC, Choudhury RP | title = Rapid neutrophil mobilization by VCAM-1+ endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 236–251 | date = March 2023 | pmid = 35134856 | pmc = 10022859 | doi = 10.1093/cvr/cvac012 }}</ref>

Neutrophils are much more numerous than the longer-lived [[monocyte]]/[[macrophage]] phagocytes. A [[pathogen]] (disease-causing microorganism or virus) is likely to first encounter a neutrophil. Some experts hypothesize that the short lifetime of neutrophils is an [[evolution]]ary adaptation. The short lifetime of neutrophils minimizes propagation of those pathogens that [[parasite|parasitize]] phagocytes (e.g. [[Leishmania]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ritter U, Frischknecht F, van Zandbergen G | title = Are neutrophils important host cells for Leishmania parasites? | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 505–510 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19762280 | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2009.08.003 }}</ref>) because the more time such parasites spend outside a host [[cell (biology)|cell]], the more likely they will be destroyed by some component of the body's defenses. Also, because neutrophil [[antimicrobial]] products can also damage host [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, their short life limits damage to the host during [[inflammation]].<ref name=Wheater>{{cite book |vauthors = Wheater PR, Stevens A |date=2002 |title=Wheater's basic histopathology: a colour atlas and text |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-443-07001-3 }}</ref>

Neutrophils will be removed after [[phagocytosis]] of pathogens by macrophages. [[PECAM-1]] and [[phosphatidylserine]] on the cell surface are involved in this process.

== Function ==
=== Chemotaxis ===<!-- [[Neutrophil chemotaxis]] redirects here -->
Neutrophils undergo a process called [[chemotaxis]] via [[amoeboid movement]], which allows them to migrate toward sites of infection or inflammation. Cell surface receptors allow neutrophils to detect chemical gradients of molecules such as [[interleukin-8]] (IL-8), [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-γ), C3a, [[Complement component 5a|C5a]], and [[leukotriene B4]], which these cells use to direct the path of their migration.

Neutrophils have a variety of specific receptors, including ones for [[Complement system|complement]], cytokines like [[interleukin]]s and IFN-γ, [[chemokine]]s, [[lectin]]s, and other proteins. They also express receptors to detect and adhere to [[endothelium]] and [[Fc receptor]]s for [[opsonin]].<ref>{{cite book |vauthors = Serhan CN, Ward PA, Gilroy DW |date=2010 |title=Fundamentals of Inflammation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-88729-8 |pages=53–54 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJq1RMPKEYkC&q=receptors+neutrophils&pg=PA54}}</ref>

In leukocytes responding to a [[chemoattractant]], the [[cell polarity#Migratory cells|cellular polarity]] is regulated by activities of small [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho]] [[guanosine triphosphatase]]s ([[Rho family of GTPases|Rho GTPases]]) and the [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]]s ([[PI3K]]s). In neutrophils, lipid products of PI3Ks regulate activation of Rac1, hematopoietic Rac2, and RhoG GTPases of the Rho family and are required for [[cell motility]]. [[Rac (GTPase)|Rac-GTPases]] regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and facilitate neutrophils adhesion, migration, and spreading.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Pantarelli C, Welch HC | title = Rac-GTPases and Rac-GEFs in neutrophil adhesion, migration and recruitment |journal = European Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume = 48 |issue = Suppl 2 |pages = e12939 |date = November 2018 |pmid = 29682742 |pmc = 6321979 |doi = 10.1111/eci.12939 }}</ref> They accumulate asymmetrically to the [[plasma membrane]] at the leading edge of polarized cells. Spatially regulating Rho GTPases and organizing the leading edge of the cell, PI3Ks and their lipid products could play pivotal roles in establishing leukocyte polarity, as compass molecules that tell the cell where to crawl.

It has been shown in mice that in certain conditions neutrophils have a specific type of migration behaviour referred to as [[neutrophil swarming]] during which they migrate in a highly coordinated manner and accumulate and cluster to sites of inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Lämmermann T, Afonso PV, Angermann BR, Wang JM, Kastenmüller W, Parent CA, Germain RN |title = Neutrophil swarms require LTB4 and integrins at sites of cell death in vivo |journal = Nature |volume = 498 |issue = 7454 | pages = 371–375 |date = June 2013 |pmid = 23708969 |pmc = 3879961 |doi = 10.1038/nature12175 |bibcode = 2013Natur.498..371L}}</ref>

In addition to recruiting and activating other cells of the immune system, neutrophils play a key role in the front-line defense against invading pathogens, and contain a broad range of proteins.<ref>Ambatipudi KS, Old JM, Guilhaus M, Raftery M, Hinds L, Deane EM (2006).

Neutrophils are [[phagocyte]]s, capable of ingesting microorganisms or particles. For targets to be recognized, they must be coated in [[opsonin]]s{{snd}}a process known as [[antibody opsonization]].<ref name=edwards/> They can internalize and kill many [[microbe]]s, each phagocytic event resulting in the formation of a [[phagosome]] into which [[reactive oxygen species]] and hydrolytic enzymes are secreted. The consumption of oxygen during the generation of reactive oxygen species has been termed the "[[respiratory burst]]", although unrelated to respiration or energy production.

The respiratory burst involves the activation of the [[enzyme]] [[NADPH oxidase]], which produces large quantities of [[superoxide]], a reactive oxygen species. Superoxide decays spontaneously or is broken down via enzymes known as [[superoxide dismutase]]s (Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD), to hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted to [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), by the green heme enzyme [[myeloperoxidase]]. It is thought that the bactericidal properties of HClO are enough to kill bacteria phagocytosed by the neutrophil, but this may instead be a step necessary for the activation of proteases.<ref name="SegalRev">{{cite journal | vauthors = Segal AW | title = How neutrophils kill microbes | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 197–223 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15771570 | pmc = 2092448 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115653 }}</ref>

Though neutrophils can kill many microbes, the interaction of neutrophils with microbes and molecules produced by microbes often alters neutrophil turnover. The ability of microbes to alter the fate of neutrophils is highly varied, can be microbe-specific, and ranges from prolonging the neutrophil lifespan to causing rapid neutrophil [[lysis]] after phagocytosis.

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Neutrophils -1.jpg|thumb|Micrograph showing several neutrophils during an acute inflammation]]
Low neutrophil counts are termed ''[[neutropenia]]''. This can be [[congenital disorder|congenital]] (developed at or before birth) or it can develop later, as in the case of [[aplastic anemia]] or some kinds of [[leukemia]]. It can also be a [[adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]] of [[medication]], most prominently [[chemotherapy]]. Neutropenia makes an individual highly susceptible to infections. It can also be the result of colonization by intracellular neutrophilic parasites.

In [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]], the important [[neutrophil elastase]] is not adequately inhibited by [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]], leading to excessive tissue damage in the presence of inflammation – the most prominent one being [[emphysema]]. Negative effects of elastase have also been shown in cases when the neutrophils are excessively activated (in otherwise healthy individuals) and release the enzyme in extracellular space. Unregulated activity of neutrophil elastase can lead to disruption of pulmonary barrier showing symptoms corresponding with [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|acute lung injury]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawabata K, Hagio T, Matsuoka S | title = The role of neutrophil elastase in acute lung injury | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 451 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12223222 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(02)02182-9 }}</ref> The enzyme also influences activity of macrophages by cleaving their [[toll-like receptor]]s (TLRs) and downregulating [[cytokine]] expression by inhibiting nuclear translocation of [[NF-κB]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Domon H, Nagai K, Maekawa T, Oda M, Yonezawa D, Takeda W, Hiyoshi T, Tamura H, Yamaguchi M, Kawabata S, Terao Y | title = Neutrophil Elastase Subverts the Immune Response by Cleaving Toll-Like Receptors and Cytokines in Pneumococcal Pneumonia | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 9 | pages = 732 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29922273 | pmc = 5996908 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00732 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In [[Familial Mediterranean fever]] (FMF), a mutation in the ''pyrin'' (or ''[[marenostrin]]'') gene, which is expressed mainly in neutrophil granulocytes, leads to a constitutively active [[acute-phase protein|acute-phase response]] and causes attacks of [[fever]], [[arthralgia]], [[peritonitis]], and – eventually – [[amyloidosis]].<ref name="fmf">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozen S | title = Familial mediterranean fever: revisiting an ancient disease | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 162 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 449–454 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12751000 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-003-1223-x | s2cid = 3464945 }}</ref>

The [[Absolute neutrophil count]] (ANC) is also used in diagnosis and prognosis. ANC is the gold standard for determining severity of neutropenia, and thus neutropenic fever. Any ANC < 1500 cells / mm<sup>3</sup> is considered neutropenia, but <500 cells / mm<sup>3</sup> is considered severe.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Gwaiz LA, Babay HH | title = The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections | journal = Medical Principles and Practice | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 344–347 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17709921 | doi = 10.1159/000104806 | s2cid = 5499290 | doi-access = free }}</ref> There is also new research tying ANC to [[myocardial infarction]] as an aid in early diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan HA, Alhomida AS, Sobki SH, Moghairi AA, Koronki HE | title = Blood cell counts and their correlation with creatine kinase and C-reactive protein in patients with acute myocardial infarction | journal = International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–55 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22328948 | pmc = 3272686 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Basili S, Di Francoi M, Rosa A, Ferroni P, Diurni V, Scarpellini MG, Bertazzoni G | title = Absolute neutrophil counts and fibrinogen levels as an aid in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction | journal = Acta Cardiologica | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–140 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15139653 | doi = 10.2143/ac.59.2.2005167 | s2cid = 37382677 }}</ref> Neutrophils promote ventricular tachycardia in acute myocardial infarction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grune J, Lewis AJ, Yamazoe M, Hulsmans M, Rohde D, Xiao L, Zhang S, Ott C, Calcagno DM, Zhou Y, Timm K, Shanmuganathan M, Pulous FE, Schloss MJ, Foy BH, Capen D, Vinegoni C, Wojtkiewicz GR, Iwamoto Y, Grune T, Brown D, Higgins J, Ferreira VM, Herring N, Channon KM, Neubauer S, Sosnovik DE, Milan DJ, Swirski FK, King KR, Aguirre AD, Ellinor PT, Nahrendorf M | title = Neutrophils incite and macrophages avert electrical storm after myocardial infarction | journal = Nature Cardiovascular Research | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 649–664 | date = July 2022 | pmid = 36034743 | pmc = 9410341 | doi = 10.1038/s44161-022-00094-w }}</ref>
