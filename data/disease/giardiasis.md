===Risk factors===
According to the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), people at greatest risk of infection are:<ref name="cdc.gov">{{cite web|author=CDC|date=July 15, 2015|title=Sources of Infection & Risk Factors|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/infection-sources.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907165106/https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/infection-sources.html|archive-date=September 7, 2017|website=Parasites – Giardia}}</ref>
* People in childcare settings
* People who are in close contact with someone who has the disease
* Travellers within areas that have poor sanitation
* People who have contact with faeces during sexual activity
* Backpackers or campers who drink untreated water from springs, lakes, or rivers
* Swimmers who swallow water from swimming pools, hot tubs, interactive fountains, or untreated recreational water from springs, lakes, or rivers
* People who get their household water from a shallow well
* People with weakened immune systems
* People who have contact with infected animals or animal environments contaminated with faeces

Factors that increase infection risk for people from developed countries include changing nappies/diapers, consuming raw food, owning a dog, and travelling in the [[developing world]].<ref name=BMJ2016/> However, 75% of infections in the United Kingdom are acquired in the UK, not through travel elsewhere.<ref name=BMJ2016/> In the United States, giardiasis occurs more often in summer, which is believed to be due to a greater amount of time spent on outdoor activities and travelling in the wilderness.<ref name=Auer2012/>

===Transmission===
Giardiasis is transmitted via the [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral route]] with the ingestion of [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]s.<ref name="Barry2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barry MA, Weatherhead JE, Hotez PJ, Woc-Colburn L | title = Childhood parasitic infections endemic to the United States | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 471–85 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23481112 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2012.12.011 }}</ref> Primary routes are personal contact and contaminated water and food.<ref name="Barry2013"/> The cysts can stay infectious for up to three months in cold water.<ref name=Auer2012/>

Many people with ''Giardia'' infections have no or few symptoms.<ref name=Gard2001>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner TB, Hill DR | title = Treatment of giardiasis | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 114–28 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11148005 | pmc = 88965 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.14.1.114-128.2001 }}</ref> They may, however, still spread the disease.<ref name=Gard2001/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Giardia LifeCycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|Life cycle of ''Giardia'']]
The life cycle of ''Giardia'' consists of a cyst form and a trophozoite form.<ref name=":4" /> The cyst form is infectious and once it has found a host, transforms into the trophozoite form.<ref name=":4" /> This trophozoite attaches to the intestinal wall and replicates within the gut.<ref name=":4" /> As trophozoites continue along the gastrointestinal tract, they convert back to their cyst form which is then excreted with faeces.<ref name="BMJ2016" /> Ingestion of only a few of these cysts is needed to generate infection in another host.<ref name=":6" />

Infection with ''Giardia'' results in decreased expression of [[brush border]] enzymes, morphological changes to the [[microvillus]], increased intestinal permeability, and [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]] of small intestinal [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buret AG | title = Pathophysiology of enteric infections with Giardia duodenalius | journal = Parasite | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–5 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18814692 | doi = 10.1051/parasite/2008153261 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Both trophozoites and cysts are contained within the gastrointestinal tract and do not invade beyond it.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartelt LA, Sartor RB | title = Advances in understanding Giardia: determinants and mechanisms of chronic sequelae | journal = F1000Prime Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 62 | pages = 62 | date = 2015-05-26 | pmid = 26097735 | pmc = 4447054 | doi = 10.12703/P7-62 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The attachment of [[trophozoites]] causes villous flattening and inhibition of [[disaccharidase|enzymes that break down disaccharide sugars]] in the intestines.<ref name=Cot2011 /><ref name=":5" /> Ultimately, the [[Microbiome|community of microorganisms]] that lives in the intestine may overgrow and may be the cause of further symptoms, though this idea has not been fully investigated. The alteration of the villi leads to an inability of nutrient and water absorption from the intestine, resulting in diarrhoea, one of the predominant symptoms.<ref name=":5" /> In the case of asymptomatic giardiasis, there can be malabsorption with or without histological changes to the small intestine. The degree to which malabsorption occurs in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is highly varied.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The species ''Giardia intestinalis'' uses [[Protease|enzymes that break down proteins]] to attack the villi of the brush border and appears to increase crypt cell proliferation and crypt length of crypt cells existing on the sides of the villi. On an immunological level, activated host [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] attack endothelial cells that have been injured in order to remove the cell.<ref name=Cot2011 /> This occurs after the disruption of proteins that [[Tight junction|connect brush border endothelial cells to one another]].<ref name=":5" /> The result is increased intestinal permeability.<ref name=":5" />

There appears to be a further increase in programmed enterocyte cell death by ''Giardia intestinalis'', which further damages the intestinal barrier and increases permeability.<ref name=":5" /> There is significant upregulation of the programmed cell death cascade by the parasite, and, furthermore, substantial downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein [[Bcl-2]] and upregulation of the proapoptotic protein [[Bcl-2-associated X protein|Bax]].<ref name=Cot2011 /> These connections suggest a role of [[caspase|caspase-dependent apoptosis]] in the pathogenesis of giardiasis.<ref name=Cot2011 />

''Giardia'' protects its own growth by reducing the formation of the gas [[nitric oxide]] by consuming all local [[arginine]], which is the [[amino acid]] necessary to make nitric oxide.<ref name=Cot2011 /> Arginine starvation is known to be a cause of programmed cell death, and local removal is a strong apoptotic agent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muhkerjee|first=Sandeep|title=Giardiasis|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/176718-overview#a0104|publisher=Medscape Reference|access-date=21 November 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117033849/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/176718-overview#a0104|archive-date=17 November 2012}}</ref>

== Host defence ==
Host defence against ''Giardia'' consists of natural barriers, production of nitric oxide, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

=== Natural barriers ===
Natural barriers defend against the parasite entering the host's body. Natural barriers consist of [[mucus]] layers, bile salt, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s. Additionally, [[peristalsis]] and the renewal of [[enterocyte]]s provide further protection against parasites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eckmann|first=Lars|date=May 2003|title=Mucosal defences against Giardia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3024.2003.00634.x|journal=Parasite Immunology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=259–270|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3024.2003.00634.x|pmid=12969444|s2cid=7155680|issn=0141-9838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.

=== Nitric oxide production ===
Nitric oxide does not kill the parasite, but it inhibits the growth of trophozoites as well as excystation and encystation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Eckmann|first1=Lars|last2=Laurent|first2=Fabrice|last3=Langford|first3=T.

=== Innate immune system ===

==== Lectin pathway of complement ====
The lectin pathway of complement is activated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) which binds to N-acetylglucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine is a ligand for MBL and is present on the surface of ''Giardia''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Evans-Osses|first1=Ingrid|last2=Ansa-Addo|first2=Ephraim A.|last3=Inal|first3=Jameel M.|last4=Ramirez|first4=Marcel I.|date=May 2010|title=Involvement of lectin pathway activation in the complement killing of Giardia intestinalis|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=395|issue=3|pages=382–386|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.025|pmid=20382117|issn=0006-291X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==== The classical pathway of complement ====
The classical pathway of complement is activated by antibodies specific against ''Giardia''.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

=== Adaptive immune system ===

==== Antibodies ====
Antibodies inhibit parasite replication and also induce parasite death via the classical pathway of complement.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Infection with ''Giardia'' typically results in a strong antibody response against the parasite. While IgG is made in significant amounts, IgA is believed to be more important in parasite control. IgA is the most abundant isotype in intestinal secretions, and it is also the dominant isotype in a mother's milk. Antibodies in a mother's milk protect children against giardiasis (passive immunisation).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tellez|first1=Aleyda|last2=Winiecka-krusnell|first2=Jadwiga|last3=Paniagua|first3=Margarita|last4=Linder|first4=Ewert|date=May 2003|title=Antibodies in Mother's Milk Protect Children Against Giardiasis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00365540310008041|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=35|issue=5|pages=322–325|doi=10.1080/00365540310008041|pmid=12875519|s2cid=12621232|issn=0036-5548}}</ref>

==== T-cells ====
The major aspect of adaptive immune responses is the [[T-cell]] response. ''Giardia'' is an extracellular pathogen. Therefore CD4+ helper T-cells are primarily responsible for this protective effect.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Steven M.|last2=Nash|first2=Theodore E.|date=2000-01-01|title=T-Cell-Dependent Control of Acute Giardia lamblia Infections in Mice|journal=Infection and Immunity|volume=68|issue=1|pages=170–175|doi=10.1128/iai.68.1.170-175.2000|pmid=10603384|pmc=97117|issn=1098-5522|doi-access=free}}</ref>

One role of helper T-cells is to promote antibody production and isotype switching. Other roles include cytokine production (Il-4,IL-9) to help recruit other effector cells of the immune response.<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Kevin G.-E.|last2=Yu|first2=Linda C.

Person-to-person transmission accounts for the majority of ''Giardia'' infections, and is usually associated with poor hygiene and sanitation. ''Giardia'' is often found on the surface of the ground, in the soil, in undercooked foods, and in water, and on hands that have not been properly cleaned after handling infected [[feces|faeces]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Giardia |date=March 2011 |work=Parasites |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/}}</ref> Water-borne [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] is associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. In the U.S., outbreaks typically occur in small water systems using inadequately treated surface water. [[Sexually transmitted disease|Venereal]] transmission happens through faecal-oral contamination. Additionally, nappy/diaper changing and inadequate handwashing are risk factors for transmission from infected children. Lastly, food-borne epidemics of ''Giardia'' have developed through the contamination of food by infected food-handlers.<ref name="pennardt_g">{{EMedicine|article|176718|Giardiasis}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is not always necessary as the infection usually resolves on its own.<ref name=Cot2011 /> However, if the illness is acute or symptoms persist and medications are needed to treat it, a [[nitroimidazole]] medication is used such as [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]], [[secnidazole]] or [[ornidazole]].<ref name="Barry2013"/>

In both cats and dogs, giardiasis usually responds to metronidazole and fenbendazole. Metronidazole in pregnant cats can cause developmental malformations.<ref name=":9" /> Many cats dislike the taste of fenbendazole.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook|last=Eldredge|first=Debra M.|publisher=Howell Book House|year=2008|pages=67}}</ref> Giardiasis has been shown to decrease weight in livestock.<ref name=Cot2011 />
