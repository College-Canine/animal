The '''English Cocker Spaniel''' is a [[breed]] of [[gun dog]]. It is noteworthy for producing one of the most varied numbers of pups in a litter among all dog breeds. The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured, sporting dog<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHkKjYN5EV0C&q=checkers+cocker+spaniel&pg=PA10|title=The Cocker Spaniel Handbook|first=D.

It is one of several varieties of [[spaniel]] and is the foundation of its American cousin, the [[American Cocker Spaniel]]. The English Cocker is closer to the working-dog form of the [[Field Spaniel]] and the [[English Springer Spaniel]]. English Cocker Spaniels are also known as the "Merry Spaniel" due to their constantly wagging tail.

Outside the US, the breed is usually known simply as the '''Cocker Spaniel''', as is the American Cocker Spaniel within the US. The OED states that the word ''cocker'' is derived from the fact the breed was used to flush [[woodcock]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cocker etymology |url=https://www.oed.com/dictionary/cocker_n5?tab=etymology#9027194 |website=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University |access-date=24 February 2024}}</ref>

[[File:Englishcockerspaniellll.jpg|thumb|Golden coloured English cocker spaniel.]]
Spaniel type dogs have been found in art and literature for almost 500 years.<ref name="Kolehouse1">{{cite web | author=Kolehouse, Bobbie | title=Dusting off History to Look at Cocker Hunting Tradition Part I | website=Spaniel Journal| url=http://www.spanieljournal.com/bkolehouse.html|access-date=13 September 2009}}</ref>{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}} Initially, spaniels in England were divided among land spaniels and water spaniels. The differentiation among the spaniels that led to the [[breed]]s that we see today did not begin until the mid-19th century. During this time, the land spaniels became a bit more specialised and divisions among the types were made based upon weight. According to the 1840 Encyclopedia of Rural Sports, Cockers were 12–20&nbsp;lb (5.5–9&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Kolehouse1" />{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}} At this time it was not uncommon for Cockers and Springers to come from the same litter. Even a puppy from a "Toy" sized lineage could grow to be a springer.<ref name="Kolehouse1" />{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}}

There is no indication from these early sources that spaniels were used to retrieve games. Rather they were used to drive the game toward the guns.<ref name="Kolehouse1" />{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}}

During the 1850s and 1860s, other types of Cockers were recorded. There were [[Welsh Springer Spaniel]]s and Devonshire Cockers. Additionally, small dogs from [[Sussex Spaniel]] litters were called Cockers.<ref name="Kolehouse1" />{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}} In 1874 the first [[stud book]]s were published by the newly formed [[kennel club]]. Any spaniel under 25&nbsp;lb (11&nbsp;kg) was placed in the Cocker breeding pool, however, the Welsh Cocker was reclassified as a Springer in 1903 due to its larger size and shorter ear.<ref name="Kolehouse1" /> {{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}}"...in those days only those dogs up to a hard day's work and sensible specimens were allowed to live, as absolute sporting purposes were about their only enjoyment and dog shows were hardly heard of...".<ref name="Kolehouse1" />{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024|reason=Better to use the original source/references provided in the article}}

The [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing began in earnest among spaniels after the Spaniel Club was formed in 1885. When showing, the new ''Springer'' and ''Cocker'', both were in the same class until The Spaniel Club created [[breed standard]]s for each of the types. The Kennel Club separated the two types eight years later. Since then, the Springer and Cocker enthusiasts have bred in the separate traits that they desired. Today, the breed differs in more ways than weight alone.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

At [[Crufts]], the English Cocker Spaniel has been the most successful breed in winning [[List of Best in Show winners of Crufts|Best in Show]], winning on a total of seven occasions between 1928 and 2009, with wins in 1930, 1931, 1938, 1939, 1948, 1950 and 1996. In addition, the breed makes up three of the four winners who have won the title on more than one occasion with all three coming from [[H. S. Lloyd]]'s Ware kennel. Due to World War II, the English Cocker Spaniel managed to be the only breed to have won the title between 1938 and 1950, although the competition was only held on four occasions during that period. The most recent best in show was Sh. Ch. [[Canigou Cambrai]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=Past and Present Winners |url=https://crufts.org.uk/about-us/past-winners/ |website=Crufts |access-date=24 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hvuttar.net/?h=17160&g=307 |title=Besti hundur sýningar á Crufts, frá árunum 1928–2002 |language=is |publisher=Hvuttar.net |access-date=28 December 2009}}</ref>

=== Field Spaniel ===
In the late 19th century with the increase in popularity of dog shows and the creation of standards for various breeds, the Spaniel family began to split into various different breeds. A group of enthusiasts decided to create a large black spaniel breed. Four dogs would act as progenitors for this new breed, of which two were Cocker Spaniels, one was a Cocker Spaniel/[[English Water Spaniel]] cross and one was a [[Norfolk Spaniel]]. This new breed was named the [[Field Spaniel]], and was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1892.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

=== American Cocker Spaniel ===
[[File:AKC English Cocker Spaniel Dog Show 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|English Cocker Spaniel]]
The [[American Cocker Spaniel]] was developed from the English Cocker Spaniel in the 19th century to retrieve [[quail]]s and [[woodcock]]s. They were originally divided from the English Cocker solely on a size basis but were bred over the years for different specific traits.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The two Cocker Spaniels were shown together in America until 1936, when the English Cocker received status as a separate breed. The American Kennel Club granted a separate breed designation for the English Cocker Spaniel in 1946.<ref name="akc" /> The American breed has a shorter snout and is groomed differently from the English Cocker.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

== Description ==
The English Cocker Spaniel is a sturdy, compact and well-balanced dog. It has a characteristic expression showing intelligence and alertness. Its eyes should be dark and its lobular ears should reach "a bit past" the tip of the nose when pulled forward.<ref name="akc" /> Today, a significant difference in appearance exists between field-bred and [[conformation show]]-bred dogs.{{cn|date=February 2024}} The Cocker's tail is customarily [[Docking (animals)|docked]] in North America.<ref name="akc" /> In countries where docking is legal, the tail is generally docked at about 4–5 inches (10–13&nbsp;cm) in field-bred dogs while show dogs are generally docked closer to the body.{{cn|date=February 2024}} Docking is now illegal in Australia<ref>{{cite web |title=Is the tail docking of dogs legal in Australia? |url=https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/is-the-tail-docking-of-dogs-legal-in-australia/ |website=Royal Australian Society for the Protection of Animals |access-date=19 February 2024}}</ref> and South Africa.{{cn|date=February 2024}} In England and Wales, docking can only be carried out on dogs where the owners have proved that the dogs will be used as working or shooting dogs.<ref name="defra">{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/act/docking.htm |title=Defra, UK – Animal Health and Welfare |access-date=9 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427081157/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/welfare/act/docking.htm |archive-date=27 April 2009}}</ref>

The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are on average between {{convert|15.5|and|16|in|cm}} at the [[withers]] with the females a little smaller, growing to between {{convert|15|and|15.5|in|cm}}.

The English Cocker Spaniel is similar to the English Springer Spaniel and at first glance, the only major difference is the larger size of the Springer. However, English Cockers also tend to have longer, and lower-set ears than English Springers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle, their eyes are not as prominent and the coat is less abundant.<ref name="differences">{{cite web|last=Gormish |first=Denise |publisher=English Cocker Spaniel Club of America |url=http://www.ecsca.org/difference.html |title=A comparison of English Springer Spaniels, American Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels |access-date=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121224038/http://ecsca.org/difference.html |archive-date=21 November 2010}}</ref>

With a good level of socialisation at an early age, Cocker Spaniels can get along well with people, children, other dogs and other pets.<ref>Coile, D. Caroline (2006). The Cocker Spaniel Handbook. Barron's Educational Series Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7641-3459-3}}.</ref> This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling. When trained with a soft hand and plentiful rewards, the Cocker Spaniel will be an obedient and loving companion with a happy, cheerful nature.<ref name="coile13">[[#CITEREFCoile2006|Coile (2006)]]: p. 13</ref>

This breed, like many others with origins as [[working dog]]s, has some genetic lines that focus on [[working dog|working-dog]] skills and other lines that focus on ensuring that the dog's appearance conforms to a breed standard; these are referred to as the "working" (or "field-bred") and "conformation" strains, respectively. After World War II, Cocker Spaniels bred for [[pet]]s and for the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[Dog show|conformation showing]] increased enormously in popular appeal, and, for a while, was the most numerous [[Kennel club|Kennel Club]] registered breed. This popularity increased the view that all Cockers were useless as working dogs.<ref name="svw" /> However, for most dogs this is untrue, as even some show-bred Cockers have retained their working instinct.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moxon |first=P.R. |date=1960s |publisher=Felsteadgundogs.com |url=http://felsteadgundogs.com/gundogs.html |title=The Cocker Spaniel as a Gundog |access-date=5 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609112540/http://felsteadgundogs.com/gundogs.html |archive-date=9 June 2009}}</ref>

Today, this breed is experiencing a resurgence in usage as a working and hunting dog. Dogs from working lines are noticeably distinct in appearance. As is the case with the English Springer Spaniel, the working type has been bred exclusively to perform in the field as a hunting companion. Their coat is shorter and ears less pendulous than the show-bred type. Although registered as the same breed, the two strains have diverged significantly enough that they are rarely crossed.<ref name="svw">{{cite web|publisher=Petwave.com |url=http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/English-Cocker-Spaniel/Show-vs-Working.aspx|title=Show Bred vs Working Cockers| access-date=5 September 2009}}</ref> The dogs that have dominated the [[hunt test]], [[field trial]] and [[hunting]] scene in the United States are field-bred dogs from recently imported English lines.<ref name="Thoms">{{cite journal | author=Thoms, Jerry | title=Pocket Rockets | journal=Gun Dog Magazine |date=December 2002 | url=http://www.roettgerridge.com/8873_eprint.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071203190639/http://www.roettgerridge.com/8873_eprint.pdf

=== Skills ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2024}}
A field-bred cocker spaniel is first and foremost an upland flushing dog. In performing this task there are some skills the dog must be trained to perform.

* '''Hup''' This is the traditional command to sit and stay. To be an effective hunter the dog must comply with this command absolutely. When this command is given, the dog can be given directions called to the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allows the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.
* '''Retrieve to Hand''' The majority of hunters and all [[hunt test]] or [[field trial]] judges require that a dog deliver a bird to hand, meaning that a dog will hold the bird until told to give it to the hunter directly.
* '''Quarter''' Dogs must work in a pattern in front of the hunter seeking [[upland game bird]]s. The dog must be taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside of shooting distance.
* '''Follow Hand Signals''' Upland hunting involves pursuing wild game in its native habitat. Gun dogs must investigate likely covers for [[upland game bird]]s. The dog must be responsive to hand signals in order for the hunter to be able to direct the dog into areas of particular interest.
* '''Steady''' When hunting upland birds, a flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning that he sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. He does this in order to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds when pursuing a missed bird.

[[File:Cornell-Flush-Barretts-1931.jpg|thumb|[[Katharine Cornell]] and her own cocker spaniel Flush in the original Broadway production of ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' (1931)]]
