{{about|the biological definition of the word Lysis}}
'''Lysis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|s|ɪ|s}} {{respell|LY|sis}}) is the breaking down of the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a  [[Cell (biology)|cell]], often by [[virus|viral]], [[enzyme|enzymic]], or [[osmosis|osmotic]] (that is, "lytic" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|t|ɪ|k}} {{Respell|LIT|ik}}) mechanisms that compromise its integrity. A fluid containing the contents of lysed cells is called a ''lysate''. In [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[cell biology]] laboratories, [[cell culture]]s may be subjected to lysis in the process of purifying their components, as in [[protein purification]], [[DNA extraction]], [[RNA extraction]], or in purifying [[organelle]]s.

Many species of [[bacteria]] are  subject to lysis by the enzyme [[lysozyme]], found in animal [[saliva]], [[egg white]], and other [[secretion]]s.<ref>{{cite book |editor=P.

==Cytolysis==
{{main article|Cytolysis}}

Cytolysis occurs when a cell bursts due to an osmotic imbalance that has caused excess water to move into the cell.

Cytolysis can be prevented by several different mechanisms, including the [[contractile vacuole]] that exists in some [[paramecium|paramecia]], which rapidly pump water out of the cell. Cytolysis does not occur under normal conditions in plant cells because plant cells have a strong cell wall that contains the osmotic pressure, or [[turgor pressure]], that would otherwise cause cytolysis to occur.

==Oncolysis==
Oncolysis is the destruction of [[neoplastic]] cells or of a [[tumour]].

The term is also used to refer to the reduction of any [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oncolysis|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/oncolysis|work=Medical Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|access-date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

==Plasmolysis==
{{main article|Plasmolysis}}
[[Image:Rhoeo Discolor - Plasmolysis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Plasmolysis]]
Plasmolysis is the contraction of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s within plants due to the loss of water through [[osmosis]].  In a [[Tonicity#Hypertonic solution|hypertonic]] environment, the cell membrane peels off the [[cell wall]] and the [[vacuole]] collapses. These cells will eventually wilt and die unless the flow of water caused by osmosis can stop the contraction of the [[cell membrane]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119265683/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |title=Wiley InterScience : Journals : New Phytologist |access-date=2008-09-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522165401/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119265683/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02952.x |volume=126 |journal=New Phytologist |pages=571–591|doi-access= }}

==Immune response==

{{main article|Red blood cell#Secondary functions}}
Erythrocytes' hemoglobin release [[free radicals]] in response to pathogens when lysed by them. This can damage the pathogens.<ref>{{cite web |url-status=dead |url=http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/eventlist/happenings/details/2007/dingSTsep07.pdf |title=Red blood cells do more than just carry oxygen.

==Applications==

Cell lysis is used in laboratories to break open cells and purify or further study their contents. Lysis in the laboratory may be affected by [[enzyme]]s or [[detergent]]s or other [[chaotropic agent]]s. Mechanical disruption of cell membranes, as by repeated freezing and thawing, [[sonication]], pressure, or [[filtration]] may also be referred to as lysis. Many laboratory experiments are sensitive to the choice of lysis mechanism;  often it is desirable to avoid mechanical [[shear force]]s that would denature or degrade sensitive macromolecules, such as [[protein]]s and [[DNA]], and different types of detergents can yield different results. The unprocessed solution immediately after lysis but before any further extraction steps is often referred to as a ''crude lysate''.<ref name=thermo>{{cite book|title=Thermo Scientific Pierce Cell Lysis Technical Handbook|publisher=Thermo Scientific|edition=2|url=https://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/brochures/1601757-Cell-Lysis-Handbook.pdf}}</ref><ref name=embl>{{cite web|title=Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility: Protein Purification: Extraction and Clarification|url=http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/protein_purification/extraction_clarification/index.html|website=European Molecular Biology Laboratory|access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref>

For example, lysis is used in [[Western blotting|western]] and [[Southern blotting]] to analyze the composition of specific [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and [[nucleic acids]] individually or as [[Protein complex|complexes]]. Depending on the [[detergent]] used, either all or some membranes are lysed. For example, if only the [[cell membrane]] is lysed then [[gradient centrifugation]] can be used to collect certain [[organelle]]s. Lysis is also used for [[protein purification]], [[DNA extraction]], and [[RNA extraction]].<ref name="thermo" /><ref name="embl" />

==Methods==

===Chemical lysis===
This method uses chemical disruption. It is the most popular and simple approach. Chemical lysis chemically deteriorates/solubilizes the proteins and lipids present within the membrane of targeted cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Seung-min |last2=Sabour |first2=Andrew F |last3=Ho Son |first3=Jun |last4=Hun Lee |first4=Sang |last5=Lee |first5=Luke |title=Toward Integrated Molecular Diagnostic System (iMDx): Principles and Applications |journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Engineering |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=1506–1521 |pmc=4141683 |year=2014 |pmid=24759281 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2014.2309119 }}</ref>

===Acoustic lysis===
This method uses ultrasonic waves to generate areas of high and low pressure which causes cavitation and in turn, cell lysis. Though this method usually comes out clean, it fails to be cost effective and consistent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Seung-min |last2=Sabour |first2=Andrew F |last3=Ho Son |first3=Jun |last4=Hun Lee |first4=Sang |last5=Lee |first5=Luke |title=Toward Integrated Molecular Diagnostic System (iMDx): Principles and Applications |journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Engineering |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=1506–1521 |pmc=4141683 |year=2014 |pmid=24759281 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2014.2309119 }}</ref>

===Mechanical lysis===
This method uses physical penetration to pierce or cut a cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Seung-min |last2=Sabour |first2=Andrew F |last3=Ho Son |first3=Jun |last4=Hun Lee |first4=Sang |last5=Lee |first5=Luke |title=Toward Integrated Molecular Diagnostic System (iMDx): Principles and Applications |journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Engineering |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=1506–1521 |pmc=4141683 |year=2014 |pmid=24759281 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2014.2309119 }}</ref>

===Enzymatic lysis===
This method uses enzymes such as lysozyme or proteases to disintegrate the cell membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Danaeifar |first=Mohsen |date=November 2022 |title=New horizons in developing cell lysis methods: A review |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.28198 |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |language=en |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=3007–3021 |doi=10.1002/bit.28198 |pmid=35900072 |s2cid=251132821 |issn=0006-3592}}</ref>
