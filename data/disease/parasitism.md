'''Parasitism''' is a <!--Please do not try to put anything humorous here: it is forbidden and you can be blocked from editing.-->[[Symbiosis|close relationship]] between [[species]], where one organism, the parasite, lives on or inside another organism, the [[Host (biology)|host]], causing it some harm, and is [[Adaptation|adapted]] structurally to this way of life.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=4–5}} The entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] characterised parasites as "predators that eat prey in units of less than one".<ref name=Wilson2014/> Parasites include single-celled [[protozoa]]ns<!--parasitologists still call them this, it's the usage in this domain--> such as the agents of [[malaria]], [[sleeping sickness]], and [[amoebic dysentery]]; animals such as [[hookworm]]s, [[lice]], [[mosquito]]es, and [[vampire bat]]s; [[fungi]] such as [[Armillaria mellea|honey fungus]] and the agents of [[ringworm]]; and plants such as [[mistletoe]], [[dodder]], and the [[Orobanchaceae|broomrapes]].

There are six major parasitic [[Behavioral ecology#Evolutionarily stable strategy|strategies]] of exploitation of animal hosts, namely [[parasitic castration]], directly transmitted parasitism (by contact), [[wikt:trophic|trophically{{hyp}}<!--BE, one word, not stand alone-->transmitted]] parasitism (by being eaten), [[Disease vector|vector-transmitted]] parasitism, [[parasitoid]]ism, and micropredation. One major axis of classification concerns invasiveness: an endoparasite lives inside the host's body; an ectoparasite lives outside, on the host's surface.

Like predation, parasitism is a type of [[Consumer–resource interactions|consumer–resource interaction]],<ref name="pmid21199247">{{cite journal |last=Getz |first=W. M. |title=Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer-resource modelling |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=113–124 |year=2011 |pmid=21199247 |pmc=3032891 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x|bibcode=2011EcolL..14..113G }}</ref> but unlike [[Predation|predators]], parasites, with the exception of parasitoids, are typically much smaller than their hosts, do not kill them, and often live in or on their hosts for an extended period. Parasites of animals are highly [[Generalist and specialist species|specialised]], and [[reproduction|reproduce]] at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples include interactions between [[vertebrate]] hosts and [[tapeworms]], [[Trematoda|flukes]], the malaria-causing ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species, and [[flea]]s.

Parasites reduce host [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by general or specialised [[pathology]], from parasitic castration to modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular by feeding on them and by using intermediate (secondary) hosts to assist in their [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] from one definitive (primary) host to another. Although parasitism is often unambiguous, it is part of a spectrum of interactions between [[species]], grading via parasitoidism into predation, through evolution into [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and in some fungi, shading into being [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]].

People have known about parasites such as [[roundworm]]s and tapeworms since [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In [[early modern]] times, [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] observed ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' in his microscope in 1681, while [[Francesco Redi]] described internal and external parasites including [[sheep liver fluke]] and [[tick]]s. Modern [[parasitology]] developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. These were exploited to [[satire|satirical]] effect in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1733 poem "On Poetry: A Rhapsody", comparing poets to [[hyperparasitical]] "vermin". In fiction, [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and its many later adaptations featured a [[hematophagy|blood-drinking]] parasite. [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was one of many works of [[science fiction]] to feature a parasitic alien species.<ref name=Guardian2009/>

== Etymology ==

First used in English in 1539, the word ''parasite'' comes from the [[Old French|Medieval French]] ''parasite'', from the [[Latin]] ''parasitus'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''παράσιτος'' (''parasitos''), "one who eats at the table of another"<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fsitos παράσιτος], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that from ''παρά'' (''para''), "beside, by"<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + ''σῖτος'' (''sitos''), "wheat", hence "food".<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%3Dtos σῖτος], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The related term ''parasitism'' appears in English from 1611.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsitismo%2Fs σιτισμός], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

Parasitism is a kind of [[symbiosis]], a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between a parasite and its host. Unlike [[saprotroph]]s, parasites feed on living hosts, though some parasitic fungi, for instance, may continue to feed on hosts they have killed. Unlike [[commensalism]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], the parasitic relationship harms the host, either feeding on it or, as in the case of intestinal parasites, consuming some of its food. Because parasites interact with other species, they can readily act as [[Disease vector|vectors]] of pathogens, causing [[parasitic disease|disease]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Overview of Parasitology |url=http://parasite.org.au/para-site/introduction/introduction-essay.html |publisher=Australian Society of Parasitology and Australian Research Council/National Health and Medical Research Council) Research Network for Parasitology |date=July 2010 |isbn=978-1-86499-991-4 |quote=Parasitism is a form of symbiosis, an intimate relationship between two different species. There is a biochemical interaction between host and parasite; i.e. they recognize each other, ultimately at the molecular level, and host tissues are stimulated to react in some way.

Within that scope are many possible strategies. [[Taxonomist]]s classify parasites in a variety of overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]], which are sometimes very complex. An [[obligate parasite]] depends completely on the host to complete its life cycle, while a [[facultative parasite]] does not. Parasite life cycles involving only one host are called "direct"; those with a definitive host (where the parasite reproduces sexually) and at least one intermediate host are called "indirect".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/General/animpara.htm |title=A Classification of Animal-Parasitic Nematodes |work=plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu |access-date=25 February 2016 |archive-date=6 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006152348/http://plpnemweb.ucdavis.edu/nemaplex/General/animpara.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Garcia |first=L.

Much of the thinking on types of parasitism has focused on terrestrial animal parasites of animals, such as helminths. Those in other environments and with other hosts often have analogous strategies. For example, the [[snubnosed eel]] is probably a facultative endoparasite (i.e., it is semiparasitic) that opportunistically burrows into and eats sick and dying fish.<ref name=Caira1997>{{cite journal |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=49 |pages=139–144 |year=1997 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226076003 |title=Pugnose eels, ''Simenchelys parasiticus'' (Synaphobranchidae) from the heart of a shortfin mako, ''Isurus oxyrinchus'' (Lamnidae) |last1=Caira |first1=J.

The sensory inputs that a parasite employs to identify and approach a potential host are known as "host cues". Such cues can include, for example, vibration,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lawrence |first=P.

=== Major strategies ===

There are six major parasitic [[Behavioral ecology#Evolutionarily stable strategy|strategies]], namely [[parasitic castrator|parasitic castration]]; directly transmitted parasitism; [[wikt:trophic|trophically]]-transmitted parasitism; [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-transmitted parasitism; [[parasitoid]]ism; and micropredation. These apply to parasites whose hosts are plants as well as animals.<ref name=Rollinson>{{cite journal |last=Poulin |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |editor1=Rollinson, D. |editor2=Hay, S.

A perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four key questions: the effect on the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a parasite's hosts; the number of hosts they have per life stage; whether the host is prevented from reproducing; and whether the effect depends on intensity (number of parasites per host). From this analysis, the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge, alongside predation.<ref name=LaffertyKuris2002>{{cite journal |last1=Lafferty |first1=K. D. |last2=Kuris |first2=A.

[[File:Sacculina carcini.jpg|thumb|The parasitic castrator ''[[Sacculina carcini]]'' (highlighted) attached to [[Liocarcinus holsatus|its crab host]]]]

[[Parasitic castrator]]s partly or completely destroy their host's ability to reproduce, diverting the energy that would have gone into reproduction into host and parasite growth, sometimes causing gigantism in the host. The host's other systems remain intact, allowing it to survive and to sustain the parasite.<ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/>{{sfn|Poulin|2007|p=111}} Parasitic crustaceans such as those in the specialised [[barnacle]] genus ''[[Sacculina]]'' specifically cause damage to the gonads of their many species<ref name="Elumalai Viswanathan Pravinkumar Raffi">{{cite journal |last1=Elumalai |first1=V. |last2=Viswanathan |first2=C. |last3=Pravinkumar |first3=M. |last4=Raffi |first4=S.

In the case of ''Sacculina'', the testes of over two-thirds of their crab hosts degenerate sufficiently for these male crabs to develop female [[secondary sex characteristic]]s such as broader abdomens, smaller [[chela (organ)|claws]] and egg-grasping appendages. Various species of helminth castrate their hosts (such as insects and snails). This may happen directly, whether mechanically by feeding on their gonads, or by secreting a chemical that destroys reproductive cells; or indirectly, whether by secreting a hormone or by diverting nutrients. For example, the [[Trematoda|trematode]] ''[[Zoogonus lasius]]'', whose [[Trematode life cycle stages|sporocysts]] lack mouths, castrates the intertidal marine snail ''[[Tritia obsoleta]]<!--formerly Ilyanassa-->'' chemically, developing in its gonad and killing its reproductive cells.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|p=111}}<ref name=Cheng13>{{cite book |last=Cheng |first=Thomas C. |title=General Parasitology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4GQlYzode8C&pg=PA13 |year=2012 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=978-0-323-14010-2 |pages=13–15}}</ref>

[[File:Male human head louse.jpg|thumb|[[Pediculus humanus capitis|Human head-lice]] are directly transmitted [[Obligate parasite|obligate]] ectoparasites]]

Directly transmitted parasites, not requiring a vector to reach their hosts, include such parasites of terrestrial vertebrates as lice and mites; marine parasites such as [[copepod]]s and [[Cyamidae|cyamid]] amphipods; [[monogenea]]ns; and many species of nematodes, fungi, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses. Whether endoparasites or ectoparasites, each has a single host-species. Within that species, most individuals are free or almost free of parasites, while a minority carry a large number of parasites; this is known as an [[aggregated distribution]].<ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/>

==== Trophically transmitted ====

[[File:Clonorchis sinensis 2.png|thumb|''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', the Chinese liver fluke, is trophically transmitted]]

[[wikt:trophic|Trophically]]-transmitted parasites are transmitted by being eaten by a host. They include trematodes (all except [[schistosomes]]), [[cestodes]], [[acanthocephala]]ns, [[Pentastomida|pentastomids]], many [[roundworms]], and many protozoa such as ''[[Toxoplasma]]''.<ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/> They have complex life cycles involving hosts of two or more species. In their juvenile stages they infect and often [[encyst]] in the intermediate host. When the intermediate-host animal is eaten by a predator, the definitive host, the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult; some live as [[intestinal parasite]]s. Many trophically transmitted parasites [[Parasite increased trophic transmission|modify the behaviour]] of their intermediate hosts, increasing their chances of being eaten by a predator. As with directly transmitted parasites, the distribution of trophically transmitted parasites among host individuals is aggregated.<ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/> [[Coinfection]] by multiple parasites is common.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=F.

==== Parasitoids ====

{{main|Parasitoid|Parasitoid wasp}}

[[Parasitoid]]s are insects which sooner or later kill their hosts, placing their relationship close to predation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Alison N. P. |title=Predation, Herbivory, and Parasitism |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |date=2010 |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=36 |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/predation-herbivory-and-parasitism-13261134 |access-date=12 February 2018 |quote=Predation, herbivory, and parasitism exist along a continuum of severity in terms of the extent to which they negatively affect an organism's fitness. ... In most situations, parasites do not kill their hosts. An exception, however, occurs with parasitoids, which blur the line between parasitism and predation.}}</ref> Most parasitoids are [[parasitoid wasp]]s or other [[hymenoptera]]ns; others include [[dipterans]] such as [[phoridae|phorid flies]]. They can be divided into two groups, idiobionts and koinobionts, differing in their treatment of their hosts.<ref name=GullanCranston2010>{{cite book |last1=Gullan |first1=P. J. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. S. |date=2010 |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |url=https://archive.org/details/insectsoutlineen00pjgu |url-access=limited |publisher=Wiley |edition=4th |isbn=978-1-118-84615-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/insectsoutlineen00pjgu/page/n332 308], 365–367, 375, 440–441}}</ref>

[[Idiobiont]] parasitoids sting their often-large prey on capture, either killing them outright or paralysing them immediately. The immobilised prey is then carried to a nest, sometimes alongside other prey if it is not large enough to support a parasitoid throughout its development. An [[oviposition|egg is laid]] on top of the prey and the nest is then sealed. The parasitoid develops rapidly through its larval and pupal stages, [[mass provisioning|feeding on the provisions]] left for it.<ref name=GullanCranston2010/>

[[Koinobiont]] parasitoids, which include [[Diptera|flies]] as well as wasps, lay their eggs inside young hosts, usually larvae. These are allowed to go on growing, so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period, ending when the parasitoids emerge as adults, leaving the prey dead, eaten from inside. Some koinobionts regulate their host's development, for example preventing it from [[pupa]]ting or making it [[ecdysis|moult]] whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult. They may do this by producing hormones that mimic the host's moulting hormones ([[ecdysteroid]]s), or by regulating the host's endocrine system.<ref name=GullanCranston2010/>

==== Micropredators ====

[[File:Anopheles minimus.jpg|thumb|[[Mosquito]]es<!-- such as ''[[Anopheles minimus]]''--> are micropredators, and important vectors of disease]]

A micropredator attacks more than one host, reducing each host's fitness by at least a small amount, and is only in contact with any one host intermittently. This behavior makes micropredators suitable as vectors, as they can pass smaller parasites from one host to another.<ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015/><ref name="Wilson2017">{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Anthony J. |display-authors=etal |title =What is a vector? |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=372 |issue=1719 |date=March 2017 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2016.0085 |pmid=28289253 |page=20160085 |pmc=5352812}}</ref><ref name=LaffertyKuris2002/> Most micropredators are [[hematophagy|hematophagic]], feeding on blood.

=== Variations ===

Among the many variations on parasitic strategies are hyperparasitism,<ref name=Dissanaike1957/> social parasitism,<ref name=Thomas2010/> brood parasitism,<ref name=Payne1997/> kleptoparasitism,<ref name=SlaterRosenblatt2005/> sexual parasitism,<ref name=Pietsch2005/> and adelphoparasitism.<ref name=Rochat2001/>

==== Hyperparasitism ====

{{main|Hyperparasite}}

[[Hyperparasite]]s feed on another parasite, as exemplified by protozoa living in helminth parasites,<ref name=Dissanaike1957>{{cite journal |last1=Dissanaike |first1=A.

In [[oak gall]] systems, there can be up to five levels of parasitism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Askew |first=R.

Hyperparasites can control their hosts' populations, and are used for this purpose [[biological pest control|in agriculture]] and to some extent in [[medicine]]. The controlling effects can be seen in the way that the [[Hypovirus#CHV1–Chestnut blight hypovirulence|CHV1 virus]] helps to control the damage that [[chestnut blight]], ''Cryphonectria parasitica'', does to [[American chestnut]] trees, and in the way that [[bacteriophage]]s can limit bacterial infections. It is likely, though little researched, that most pathogenic microparasites have hyperparasites which may prove widely useful in both agriculture and medicine.<ref name="ParrattLaine2016">{{cite journal |last1=Parratt |first1=Steven R. |last2=Laine |first2=Anna-Liisa |title=The role of hyperparasitism in microbial pathogen ecology and evolution |journal=The ISME Journal |volume=10 |issue=8 |date=January 2016|doi=10.1038/ismej.2015.247 |pmid=26784356 |pages=1815–1822|pmc=5029149 |bibcode=2016ISMEJ..10.1815P }}</ref>

==== Social parasitism ====

{{further|Ant mimicry|Cuckoo bee|Emery's rule}}

Social parasites take advantage of interspecific interactions between members of [[eusocial]] animals such as [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s, and [[bumblebee]]s.

Intraspecific social parasitism occurs in parasitic nursing, where some individual young take milk from unrelated females.

==== Brood parasitism ====

{{further|Brood parasitism}}

In [[brood parasitism]], the hosts act as parents as they raise the young as their own. Brood parasites include birds in different families such as [[cowbird]]s, [[Viduidae|whydahs]], [[cuckoo]]s, and [[black-headed duck]]s. These do not build nests of their own, but leave their eggs in nests of other [[species]]. The eggs of some brood parasites [[mimicry|mimic]] those of their hosts, while some cowbird eggs have tough shells, making them hard for the hosts to kill by piercing, both mechanisms implying selection by the hosts against parasitic eggs.<ref name=Payne1997>{{cite book |last=Payne |first=R.

==== Kleptoparasitism ====

{{further|Kleptoparasitism}}

In [[kleptoparasitism]] (from Greek κλέπτης (''kleptēs''), "thief"), parasites steal food gathered by the host. The parasitism is often on close relatives, whether within the same species or between species in the same genus or family. For instance, the many lineages of [[cuckoo bee]]s lay their eggs in the nest cells of other [[bee]]s in the same family.<ref name="SlaterRosenblatt2005">{{cite book |last1=Slater |first1=Peter J.

==== Sexual parasitism ====

{{main|Sexual parasitism}}

A unique approach is seen in some species of [[anglerfish]], such as ''[[Ceratias holboelli]]'', where the males are reduced to tiny [[sexual parasite]]s, wholly dependent on females of their own species for survival, permanently attached below the female's body, and unable to fend for themselves. The female nourishes the male and protects him from predators, while the male gives nothing back except the sperm that the female needs to produce the next generation.<ref name=Pietsch2005>{{cite journal |last=Pietsch |first=Theodore W. |title=Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes) |journal=Ichthyological Research |date=25 August 2005 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=207–236 |doi=10.1007/s10228-005-0286-2|bibcode=2005IchtR..52..207P |s2cid=24768783 }}</ref>

=== Fungi ===

{{further|Pathogenic fungus|Plant pathology}}

Parasitic [[fungi]] derive some or all of their nutritional requirements from plants, other fungi, or animals.

Plant pathogenic fungi are classified into three categories depending on their mode of nutrition: biotrophs, [[hemibiotrophs]] and necrotrophs. Biotrophic fungi derive nutrients from living plant cells, and during the course of infection they colonise their plant host in such a way as to keep it alive for a maximally long time.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fei |first1=Wang |last2=Liu |first2=Ye |date=2022-08-11 |title=Biotrophic Fungal Pathogens: a Critical Overview |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-022-04087-0 |journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology |volume=195 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |doi=10.1007/s12010-022-04087-0 |pmid=35951248 |s2cid=251474576 |issn=0273-2289}}</ref> One well-known example of a biotrophic pathogen is [[Corn smut|''Ustilago maydis'']], causative agent of the corn smut disease.

{{main|Virus |Bacteriophage}}

[[Virus]]es are obligate intracellular parasites, characterised by extremely limited biological function, to the point where, while they are evidently able to infect all other organisms from bacteria and [[archaea]] to animals, plants and fungi, it is unclear whether they can themselves be described as living. They can be either [[Orthornavirae|RNA]] or [[DNA virus]]es consisting of a single or double strand of [[genetic material]] ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]], respectively), covered in a [[protein]] coat and sometimes a [[lipid]] envelope. They thus lack all the usual machinery of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] such as [[enzyme]]s, relying entirely on the host cell's ability to replicate DNA and synthesise proteins.

[[File:Tyrannosaurus with infection.jpg|thumb|Restoration of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' with holes possibly caused by a ''[[Trichomonas]]''-like parasite]]

{{further|Evolutionary ecology}}

Parasitism is a major aspect of evolutionary ecology; for example, almost all free-living animals are host to at least one species of parasite. Vertebrates, the best-studied group, are hosts to between 75,000 and 300,000 species of helminths and an uncounted number of parasitic microorganisms. On average, a mammal species hosts four species of nematode, two of trematodes, and two of cestodes.<ref name="Dobson2008">{{cite journal |last1=Dobson |first1=A. |last2=Lafferty |first2=K.

=== Coevolution ===

{{further|Host–parasite coevolution}}

As hosts and parasites evolve together, their relationships often change. When a parasite is in a sole relationship with a host, selection drives the relationship to become more benign, even mutualistic, as the parasite can reproduce for longer if its host lives longer.<ref name=Rook2007/> But where parasites are competing, selection favours the parasite that reproduces fastest, leading to increased virulence. There are thus varied possibilities in [[host–parasite coevolution]].<ref name=MasseyBuckling2004/>

[[Evolutionary epidemiology]] analyses how parasites spread and evolve, whereas [[Darwinian medicine]] applies similar evolutionary thinking to non-parasitic diseases like [[cancer]] and [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune conditions]].<ref name="Ewald1994">{{cite book |last=Ewald |first=Paul W. |title=Evolution of Infectious Disease |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofinfec0000ewal|url-access=registration |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-534519-3 |page=8}}</ref>

==== Coevolution favouring mutualism ====

[[File:Wolbachia.png|thumb|left|''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria within an insect cell]]

Long-term coevolution sometimes leads to a relatively stable relationship tending to [[commensalism]] or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], as, all else being equal, it is in the evolutionary interest of the parasite that its host thrives. A parasite may evolve to become less harmful for its host or a host may evolve to cope with the unavoidable presence of a parasite—to the point that the parasite's absence causes the host harm. For example, although animals parasitised by [[helminth|worms]] are often clearly harmed, such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects of [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorders in animal hosts, including humans.<ref name=Rook2007>{{cite journal |last=Rook |first=G.

[[Lynn Margulis]] and others have argued, following [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s 1902 ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', that natural selection drives relationships from parasitism to mutualism when resources are limited. This process may have been involved in the [[symbiogenesis]] which formed the [[eukaryote]]s from an intracellular relationship between [[archaea]] and bacteria, though the sequence of events remains largely undefined.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |author1-link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Sagan |first2=Dorion |author2-link=Dorion Sagan |author3=Eldredge, Niles |author3-link=Niles Eldredge |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IIpAQAAMAAJ |title=What Is Life? |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-81087-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarkar |first1=Sahotra |last2=Plutynski |first2=Anya |title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN7UYNjbxsYC&pg=PA358 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-69584-5 |page=358}}</ref>

==== Competition favouring virulence ====

Competition between parasites can be expected to favour faster reproducing and therefore more [[Virulence|virulent]] parasites, by [[natural selection]].<ref name=MasseyBuckling2004>{{cite journal |last1=Massey |first1=R.

[[File:Pink Flamingos with Duck - Camargue, France - April 2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Biologists long suspected [[cospeciation]] of [[flamingo]]s and [[duck]]s with their parasitic [[louse|lice]], which were similar in the two families. Cospeciation did occur, but it led to flamingos and [[grebe]]s, with a later [[host switch]] of flamingo lice to ducks.]]

Among competing parasitic insect-killing bacteria of the genera ''[[Photorhabdus]]'' and ''[[Xenorhabdus]]'', virulence depended on the relative potency of the antimicrobial [[toxin]]s ([[bacteriocins]]) produced by the two strains involved. When only one bacterium could kill the other, the other strain was excluded by the competition. But when [[caterpillar]]s were infected with bacteria both of which had toxins able to kill the other strain, neither strain was excluded, and their virulence was less than when the insect was infected by a single strain.<ref name=MasseyBuckling2004/>

==== Cospeciation ====

A parasite sometimes undergoes [[cospeciation]] with its host, resulting in the pattern described in [[Fahrenholz's rule]], that the phylogenies of the host and parasite come to mirror each other.<ref name=Page>{{cite book |last=Page |first=Roderic D. M. |publisher=John Wiley |date=27 January 2006 |isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 |doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004124|title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |chapter=Cospeciation }}</ref>

An example is between the [[simian foamy virus]] (SFV) and its primate hosts. The phylogenies of SFV polymerase and the mitochondrial [[cytochrome c oxidase subunit II]] from African and Asian primates were found to be closely congruent in branching order and divergence times, implying that the simian foamy viruses cospeciated with Old World primates for at least 30&nbsp;million years.<ref name="SwitzerSalemi2005">{{cite journal |last1=Switzer |first1=William M. |last2=Salemi |first2=Marco |last3=Shanmugam |first3=Vedapuri |last4=Gao |first4=Feng |last5=Cong |first5=Mian-er |last6=Kuiken |first6=Carla |last7=Bhullar |first7=Vinod |last8=Beer |first8=Brigitte E. |last9=Vallet |first9=Dominique |last10=Gautier-Hion |first10=Annie |last11=Tooze |first11=Zena |last12=Villinger |first12=Francois |last13=Holmes |first13=Edward C. |last14=Heneine |first14=Walid |display-authors=3 |title=Ancient co-speciation of simian foamy viruses and primates |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7031 |year=2005 |pages=376–380 |doi=10.1038/nature03341|pmid=15772660 |bibcode=2005Natur.434..376S |s2cid=4326578 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233279 }}</ref>

The presumption of a shared evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can help elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, there has been a dispute about whether [[Phoenicopteriformes|flamingos]] are more closely related to [[Ciconiiformes|storks]] or [[Anseriformes|ducks]]. The fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks. However, evolutionary events such as the duplication, or the extinction of parasite species (without similar events on the host phylogeny) often erode similarities between host and parasite phylogenies. In the case of flamingos, they have similar lice to those of [[grebe]]s. Flamingos and grebes do have a common ancestor, implying cospeciation of birds and lice in these groups. Flamingo lice then [[host switch|switched hosts]] to ducks, creating the situation which had confused biologists.<ref name=JohnsonKennedy2006>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=K.

[[File:Toxoplasma gondii (2).jpg|thumb|The protozoan ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' facilitates its transmission by [[Behavior-altering parasites|inducing behavioral changes]] in rats through infection of neurons in their [[central nervous system]].]]

Parasites infect [[sympatry|sympatric]] hosts (those within their same geographical area) more effectively, as has been shown with [[Digenea|digenetic trematodes]] infecting lake snails.<ref name="Lively00"/> This is in line with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], which states that interactions between species lead to constant natural selection for coadaptation.

{{further|Behavior-altering parasites}}

<!--[[File:Reclinervellus nielseni.jpg|thumb|left|A larva of ''[[Reclinervellus nielseni]]'' parasitizing ''[[Cyclosa argenteoalba]]'' in Japan]]-->

Some parasites [[Behavior-altering parasites|modify host behaviour]] in order to increase their transmission between hosts, often in relation to predator and prey ([[parasite increased trophic transmission]]). For example, in the [[California coastal salt marsh]], the fluke ''[[Euhaplorchis californiensis]]'' reduces the ability of its [[killifish]] host to avoid predators.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lafferty |first1=K.

[[File:Bed bug, Cimex lectularius.jpg|thumb|Trait loss: bedbug ''[[Cimex lectularius]]'' is flightless, like many insect ectoparasites.]]

=== Trait loss ===

Parasites can exploit their hosts to carry out a number of functions that they would otherwise have to carry out for themselves. Parasites which lose those functions then have a selective advantage, as they can divert resources to reproduction. Many insect ectoparasites including [[Cimex|bedbugs]], [[Polyctenidae|batbugs]], [[lice]] and [[flea]]s have lost their [[insect flight|ability to fly]], relying instead on their hosts for transport.<ref>{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title=On the Wing: Insects, Pterosaurs, Birds, Bats and the Evolution of Animal Flight |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6xUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT119 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-999679-7 |page=119}}</ref> Trait loss more generally is widespread among parasites.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Poulin |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |url=http://faculty.uml.edu/rhochberg/hochberglab/Courses/Parasite/PDF%20Papers/Parasitology%20Papers/Myths-Realities%20Parasite%20life%20histories.pdf |title=Evolution of parasite life history traits: myths and reality |journal=Parasitology Today |date=September 1995 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=342–345 |pmid=15275316 |doi=10.1016/0169-4758(95)80187-1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216194337/http://faculty.uml.edu/rhochberg/hochberglab/Courses/Parasite/PDF%20Papers/Parasitology%20Papers/Myths-Realities%20Parasite%20life%20histories.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2012 }}</ref> An extreme example is the [[myxosporea]]n ''[[Henneguya zschokkei]]'', an ectoparasite of fish and the only animal known to have lost the ability to respire aerobically: its cells lack [[mitochondria]].<ref name="PNAS">{{Cite journal |last1=Yahalom |first1=Dayana |last2=Atkinson |first2=Stephen D.|last3=Neuhof |first3=Moran |last4=Chang |first4=E.

=== Host defences ===

Hosts have evolved a variety of defensive measures against their parasites, including physical barriers like the skin of vertebrates,<ref name=Colorado/> the immune system of mammals,<ref name=Maizels2009/> insects actively removing parasites,<ref name=Jeanne1979/> and defensive chemicals in plants.<ref name=Runyon2010/>

The evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] suggested that [[sexual reproduction]] could have evolved to help to defeat multiple parasites by enabling [[genetic recombination]], the shuffling of genes to create varied combinations. Hamilton showed by mathematical modelling that sexual reproduction would be evolutionarily stable in different situations, and that the theory's predictions matched the actual ecology of sexual reproduction.<ref name="Hamilton1990">{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=W.

This is because the male hormone [[testosterone]] encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics, favouring such males in [[sexual selection]], at the price of reducing their immune defences.<ref name="FolstadKarter1992">{{cite journal |last1=Folstad |first1=Ivar |last2=Karter |first2=Andrew John |url=https://www.academia.edu/17248251 |title=Parasites, Bright Males, and the Immunocompetence Handicap |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=3 |year=1992 |pages=603–622 |doi=10.1086/285346|s2cid=85266542 }}</ref>

==== Vertebrates ====

[[File:Short Horned Lizard (4457945238).jpg|thumb|left|The dry [[skin]] of vertebrates such as the [[short-horned lizard]] prevents the entry of many parasites.]]

The physical barrier of the tough and often dry and waterproof [[skin]] of reptiles, birds and mammals keeps invading microorganisms from entering the body. [[Human skin]] also secretes [[sebum]], which is toxic to most microorganisms.<ref name=Colorado>{{cite web |title=Host–Parasite Interactions Innate Defenses of the Host |publisher=University of Colorado |url=http://www.colorado.edu/outreach/BSI/k12activities/interactive/innatedefenses.pdf |access-date=7 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000852/http://www.colorado.edu/outreach/BSI/k12activities/interactive/innatedefenses.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the other hand, larger parasites such as [[trematode]]s detect chemicals produced by the skin to locate their hosts when they enter the water. Vertebrate [[saliva]] and tears contain [[lysozyme]], an enzyme that breaks down the [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell wall|cell walls]] of invading bacteria.<ref name=Colorado/> Should the organism pass the mouth, the [[stomach]] with its [[hydrochloric acid]], toxic to most microorganisms, is the next line of defence.<ref name=Colorado/> Some intestinal parasites have a thick, tough outer coating which is digested slowly or not at all, allowing the parasite to pass through the stomach alive, at which point they enter the intestine and begin the next stage of their life. Once inside the body, parasites must overcome the [[immune system]]'s [[serum proteins]] and [[pattern recognition receptor]]s, intracellular and cellular, that trigger the adaptive immune system's [[lymphocyte]]s such as [[T cell]]s and antibody-producing [[B cell]]s. These have receptors that recognise parasites.<ref name=Maizels2009>{{cite journal |last=Maizels |first=R. M. |title=Parasite immunomodulation and polymorphisms of the immune system |journal=J.

==== Insects ====

[[File:Leaf Spot on Oak in Gunnersbury Triangle.jpg|thumb|[[Leaf spot]] on [[oak]]. The spread of the parasitic fungus is limited by defensive chemicals produced by the tree, resulting in circular patches of damaged tissue.]]

Insects often adapt their nests to reduce parasitism. For example, one of the key reasons why the wasp ''[[Polistes canadensis]]'' nests across multiple [[honeycomb|combs]], rather than building a single comb like much of the rest of its genus, is to avoid infestation by [[tineid moth]]s. The tineid moth lays its eggs within the wasps' nests and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on wasp pupae. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance.<ref name=Jeanne1979>{{cite journal |last=Jeanne |first=Robert L. |year=1979 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226226828 |title=Construction and Utilization of Multiple Combs in Polistes canadensis in Relation to the Biology of a Predaceous Moth |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=293–310 |doi=10.1007/bf00297649|s2cid=36132488 }}</ref>

=== Ecology and parasitology ===

[[File:Condor in flight.JPG|thumb|upright|The rescuing from extinction of the [[California condor]] was a successful if very expensive project, but its [[ectoparasite]], the louse ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'', was made extinct.]]

Parasitism and parasite evolution were until the twenty-first century studied by [[parasitologist]]s, in a science dominated by medicine, rather than by [[ecologist]]s or [[evolutionary biologists]]. Even though parasite-host interactions were plainly ecological and important in evolution, the history of parasitology caused what the evolutionary ecologist Robert Poulin called a "takeover of parasitism by parasitologists", leading ecologists to ignore the area. This was in his opinion "unfortunate", as parasites are "omnipresent agents of natural selection" and significant forces in evolution and ecology.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=x, 1–2}} In his view, the long-standing split between the sciences limited the exchange of ideas, with separate conferences and separate journals. The technical languages of ecology and parasitology sometimes involved different meanings for the same words. There were philosophical differences, too: Poulin notes that, influenced by medicine, "many parasitologists accepted that evolution led to a decrease in parasite virulence, whereas modern evolutionary theory would have predicted a greater range of outcomes".{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=x, 1–2}}

Their complex relationships make parasites difficult to place in food webs: a trematode with multiple hosts for its various life cycle stages would occupy many positions in a [[food web]] simultaneously, and would set up loops of energy flow, confusing the analysis. Further, since nearly every animal has (multiple) parasites, parasites would occupy the top levels of every food web.<ref name="Sukhdeo2012">{{cite journal |last=Sukhdeo |first=Michael V.K. |title=Where are the parasites in food webs? |journal=Parasites & Vectors |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2012 |doi=10.1186/1756-3305-5-239 |pmid=23092160 |pmc=3523981 |page=239 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Parasites can play a role in the proliferation of non-native species. For example, invasive [[Carcinus maenas|green crabs]] are minimally affected by native [[Trematoda|trematodes]] on the Eastern Atlantic coast. This helps them outcompete native crabs such as the [[Cancer irroratus|Atlantic Rock]] and [[Jonah crab]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blakeslee |first1=April M.

Ecological parasitology can be important to attempts at control, like during the [[Eradication of dracunculiasis|campaign for eradicating the Guinea worm]]. Even though the parasite was eradicated in all but four countries, the worm began using frogs as an intermediary host before infecting dogs, making control more difficult than it would have been if the relationships had been better understood.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eberhard |first=M.

Although parasites are widely considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not be beneficial.

An ectoparasite, the California condor louse, ''[[Colpocephalum californici]]'', became a well-known conservation issue. A major and very costly captive breeding program was run in the United States to rescue the [[California condor]]. It was host to a louse, which lived only on it. Any lice found were "deliberately killed" during the program, to keep the condors in the best possible health. The result was that one species, the condor, was saved and returned to the wild, while another species, the parasite, became extinct.<ref name="Stringer2014">{{cite journal |last1=Stringer |first1=Andrew Paul |last2=Linklater |first2=Wayne |title=Everything in Moderation: Principles of Parasite Control for Wildlife Conservation |journal=BioScience |date=2014 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=932–937 |doi=10.1093/biosci/biu135 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

{{further|Aggregated distribution}}

A single parasite species usually has an aggregated distribution across host animals, which means that most hosts carry few parasites, while a few hosts carry the vast majority of parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders [[parametric statistics]] as commonly used by biologists invalid. [[Data transformation (statistics)|Log-transformation]] of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of [[non-parametric statistics]] is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.<ref name="pmid10780537">{{cite journal |last1=Rózsa |first1=L. |last2=Reiczigel |first2=J. |last3=Majoros |first3=G. |url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/quant_large.pdf |title=Quantifying parasites in samples of hosts |journal=J.

Given the importance of malaria, with some 220&nbsp;million people infected annually, many attempts have been made to interrupt its transmission. Various methods of [[malaria prophylaxis]] have been tried including the use of [[antimalarial drug]]s to kill off the parasites in the blood, the eradication of its mosquito vectors with [[insecticide|organochlorine and other insecticides]], and the development of a [[malaria vaccine]].

Poulin observes that the widespread [[prophylactic]] use of [[anthelmintic|anthelmintic drugs]] in domestic sheep and cattle constitutes a worldwide un[[controlled experiment]] in the life-history evolution of their parasites. The outcomes depend on whether the drugs decrease the chance of a helminth larva reaching adulthood. If so, natural selection can be expected to favour the production of eggs at an earlier age. If on the other hand the drugs mainly affects adult [[parasitic worm]]s, selection could cause delayed maturity and increased [[virulence]]. Such changes appear to be underway: the nematode ''[[Teladorsagia circumcincta]]'' is changing its adult size and [[fecundity|reproductive rate]] in response to drugs.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=265–266}}

In the [[classical era]], the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative: the ''parasitus'' was an [[patronage in ancient Rome|accepted role in Roman society]], in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, in return for "flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation".<ref>{{cite book |last=Matyszak |first=Philip |title=24 Hours in Ancient Rome: A Day in the Life of the People Who Lived There |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJY4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT252 |year=2017 |publisher=Michael O'Mara |isbn=978-1-78243-857-1 |page=252}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Damon |first1=Cynthia |chapter=5 |title=The Mask of the Parasite: A Pathology of Roman Patronage|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEJ-aA_XQQQC |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1997 |page=148 |isbn=978-0-472-10760-5 |quote=A satirist seeking to portray client misery naturally focuses on the relationship with the greatest dependency, that in which a client gets his food from his patron, and for this the prefabricated persona of the parasite proved itself extremely useful.}}</ref>
