<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Nephrotic syndrome''' is a collection of [[symptoms]] due to [[kidney]] damage. This includes [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]], [[hypoalbuminemia|low blood albumin levels]], [[hyperlipidemia|high blood lipids]], and significant [[edema|swelling]]. Other symptoms may include weight gain, feeling tired, and foamy urine. Complications may include [[blood clots]], infections, and [[high blood pressure]].<ref name="NIH2014">{{cite web |date=February 2014 |title=Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults |url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/nephrotic-syndrome-adults |access-date=9 November 2017 |website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases}}</ref>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Causes include a number of kidney diseases such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], [[membranous nephropathy]], and [[minimal change disease]].<ref name=NIH2014/><ref name=Fer2018>{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2018 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323529570|page=889|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGclDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA889|language=en}}</ref> It may also occur as a complication of [[diabetes]], [[lupus]], or [[amyloidosis]]. The underlying mechanism typically involves damage to the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]] of the kidney. Diagnosis is typically based on [[urinalysis|urine testing]] and sometimes a [[kidney biopsy]].<ref name=NIH2014/> It differs from [[nephritic syndrome]] in that there are no [[red blood cells]] in the urine.<ref name=Fer2018/>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Other efforts include managing high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and infection risk. A low-salt diet and limiting fluids are often recommended.<ref name=NIH2014/> About 5 per 100,000 people are affected per year.<ref name=Kh2016>{{cite book|last1=Kher|first1=Kanwal|last2=Schnaper|first2=H.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Gezichtsoedeem.jpg|thumb|right| Nephrotic syndrome is usually accompanied by retention of [[water]] and [[sodium]]. The degree to which this occurs can vary between slight edema in the eyelids that decreases during the day, to affecting the lower limbs, to generalized swelling, to full blown [[anasarca]].<ref name=nelson>{{cite book|last= Behrman|first= Richard E.|author2=Robert M Kliegman |author3= Hal B. Jenson|title= Nelson Tratado de Pediatria|year= 2008|publisher= [[Elsevier]], España|language= es|isbn= 978-8481747478|pages=1755}}</ref>]]

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large amounts of [[proteinuria]] (>3.5 g per 1.73&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> body surface area per day,<ref name="Electronic Module">{{cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220233419/http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html| archive-date= 2008-12-20|title= Electronic Learning Module for Kidney and Urinary Tract Diseases |access-date=2015-12-25}}</ref> or > 40&nbsp;mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), [[hypoalbuminemia]] (< 3.5 g/dl), [[hyperlipidaemia]], and [[edema]] that begins in the face. [[Lipiduria]] (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.

'''A few other characteristics seen in nephrotic syndrome are:'''
* The most common sign is [[excess fluid]] in the body due to serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues.  Sodium and water retention aggravates the edema.  This may take several forms:
** Puffiness around the [[Human eyes|eyes]], characteristically in the morning.
** [[Edema|Pitting edema]] over the [[leg]]s.
** Fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] causing [[pleural effusion]]. More commonly associated with excess fluid is pulmonary edema.
** Fluid in the [[peritoneal cavity]] causing [[ascites]].
** Generalized edema throughout the body known as [[anasarca]].
* Most of the people with nephrotic syndrome are normotensive but [[hypertension]] (rarely) may also occur.
* [[Anaemia]] (iron resistant microcytic hypochromic type) may be present due to transferrin loss.
* [[Dyspnea]] may be present due to [[pleural effusion]] or due to diaphragmatic compression with ascites.
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] is increased due to increased fibrinogen & other plasma contents.
* Some people may notice foamy or frothy [[urine]], due to a lowering of the [[surface tension]] by the severe [[proteinuria]]. Actual urinary complaints such as [[haematuria]] or [[oliguria]] are uncommon, though these are seen commonly in [[nephritic syndrome]].
* May have features of the underlying cause, such as the [[rash]] associated with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], or the [[neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]].
* Examination should also exclude other causes of gross edema—especially the [[cardiovascular]] and [[liver]] system.
* [[Muehrcke's nails]]; white lines (leukonychia) that extend all the way across the nail and lie parallel to the lunula<ref>{{cite book|title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine.|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-07-138076-0|page=659|edition=6th|editor=Freedberg, Irwin M. |display-editors=etal }}</ref>

This coefficient will be greater than 200–400&nbsp;mg/mmol in nephrotic syndrome. This pronounced loss of proteins is due to an increase in glomerular permeability that allows proteins to pass into the urine instead of being retained in the blood. Under normal conditions a 24-hour urine sample should not exceed 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams per decilitre.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/spanish/ency/article/003622.htm|title = Valores normales de proteína en orina de 24 horas|access-date = 24 August 2012}}</ref>
* [[Hypoalbuminemia]] of less than 2.5 g/dL,<ref name = "Conde" /> that exceeds the ''liver clearance'' level, that is, [[protein synthesis]] in the liver is insufficient to increase the low blood protein levels.
* [[Edema]] is thought to be caused by two mechanisms. The first being hypoalbuminemia which lowers the [[oncotic pressure]] within vessels resulting in hypovolemia and subsequent activation of the [[renin–angiotensin system]] and thus retention of sodium and water (underfill hypothesis). Additionally, it is thought that urinary proteases (excreted as a result of significant proteinuria) cause a direct effect by activating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the principal cell that leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water (overfill hypothesis). Nephrotic syndrome edema initially appears in parts of the lower body (such as the legs) and in the eyelids. In the advanced stages it also extends to the [[pleural cavity]] and [[peritoneum]] (ascites) and can even develop into a generalized anasarca.
* [[Hyperlipidaemia]] in nephrotic syndrome is typically caused by two mechanisms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davis |first1=K |last2=Kohli |first2=P |date=15 July 2019 |title=What to know about hyperlipidemia |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295385 |access-date=1 July 2021 |website=Medical News Today}}</ref> First, hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of low and very-low-density [[lipoproteins]]. There is also an increase in the liver synthesis of cholesterol. Second, lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of [[lipoprotein lipase]], the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Case Based Pediatrics Chapter |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s13c02.html |access-date=23 August 2018 |website=Hawaii.edu}}</ref> Cofactors, such as [[apolipoprotein C2]], may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins.
* [[Thrombophilia]], or hypercoagulability, is a greater predisposition for the formation of blood clots that are caused by a decrease in the levels of [[antithrombin III]] in the blood due to its loss in urine.
* [[Lipiduria]] or loss of lipids in the urine is indicative of glomerular pathology due to an increase in the filtration of lipoproteins.<ref>

=== Complications ===
Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individual's health and quality of life:<ref name="scielo">{{cite journal |last1=Álvarez |first1=Sandalio Durán |title=Complicaciones agudas del síndrome nefrótico |trans-title=Acute complications of nephrotic syndrome |language=es |journal=Revista Cubana de Pediatría |date=1999 |volume=7 |issue=4 |url=http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-75311999000400010 }}</ref>
* [[Thrombosis|Thromboembolic]] disorders: particularly those caused by a decrease in blood antithrombin III levels due to leakage. Antithrombin III counteracts the action of [[thrombin]]. Thrombosis usually occurs in the kidney veins although it can also occur in arteries. Treatment is with oral anticoagulants (not heparin as heparin acts via anti-thrombin 3 which is lost in the proteinuria so it will be ineffective.) Hypercoagulopathy due to extravasation of fluid from the blood vessels (edema) is also a risk for venous thrombosis.
* [[Infection]]s: The increased susceptibility of people with nephrotic syndrome to infections can be a result of the leakage of immunoglobulins from the blood, the loss of proteins in general, and the presence of oedematous fluid (which acts as a breeding ground for infections). The most common infection is [[peritonitis]], followed by lung, skin, and urinary infections, [[meningoencephalitis]] and in the most serious cases [[septicaemia]]. The most notable of the causative organisms are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.
* [[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.<ref name="Ruiz">{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=S. |last2=Soto |first2=S. |last3=Rodado |first3=R. |last4=Alcaraz |first4=F. |last5=López Guillén |first5=E. |title=Peritonitis bacteriana espontánea como forma de presentación de síndrome nefrótico idiopático en un adulto de raza negra |trans-title=Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as form of presentation of idiophatic nephrotic syndrome in an adult black race |language=es |journal=Anales de Medicina Interna |date=September 2007 |volume=24 |issue=9 |doi=10.4321/s0212-71992007000900008 |pmid=18198954 |doi-access=free |pages=442–4 }}</ref>
* Acute [[kidney failure]] due to [[hypovolemia]]: the loss of vascular fluid into the tissues (edema) produces a decreased blood supply to the kidneys that cause a loss of kidney function. Thus it is a tricky task to get rid of excess fluid in the body while maintaining circulatory euvolemia.
* [[Pulmonary edema]]: the loss of proteins from blood plasma and the consequent fall in oncotic pressure causes an abnormal accumulation of liquid in the lungs causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[dyspnoea]].
* [[Hypothyroidism]]: deficiency of the [[thyroglobulin]] transport protein thyroxin (a glycoprotein that is rich in [[iodine]] and is found in the [[thyroid]] gland) due to decreased thyroid-binding globulin.
* [[Vitamin D deficiency]] can occur. Vitamin D binding protein is lost.
* [[Hypocalcaemia]]: lack of [[calcifediol|25-hydroxycholecalciferol]] (the way that [[vitamin D]] is stored in the body). As vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium present in the blood, a decrease in its concentration will lead to a decrease in blood calcium levels. It may be significant enough to cause [[tetany]]. Hypocalcaemia may be relative; calcium levels should be adjusted based on the albumin level and ionized calcium levels should be checked.
* Microcytic [[hypochromic]]  [[anaemia]]: [[iron]] deficiency caused by the loss of [[ferritin]] (compound used to store iron in the body). It is iron-therapy resistant.
* Protein [[malnutrition]]: this occurs when the amount of protein that is lost in the urine is greater than that ingested, this leads to a negative [[nitrogen]] balance.<ref>{{cite book | last = Zollo| first = Anthony J| publisher = Elsevier España| title = Medicina interna. Secretos| edition = Cuarta| year = 2005| isbn = 8481748862| chapter = Nefrología| page = 283}}</ref><ref name="balancenitrógeno" />
* [[Growth retardation]]: This can occur in cases of relapse or resistance to therapy. Causes of growth retardation are protein deficiency from the loss of protein in urine, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (reduced protein intake), and steroid therapy (catabolism).
* [[Cushing's syndrome]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/cushings-syndrome/| title=Cushing's Syndrome|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 11 July 2021}}</ref>

== Causes ==
[[File:Glomerulus pas.JPG|thumb|Histological image of a normal kidney glomerulus. It is possible to see a glomerulus in the centre of the image surrounded by kidney tubules.]]
Nephrotic syndrome has many causes and may either be the result of a glomerular disease that can be either limited to the kidney, called ''primary'' nephrotic syndrome (primary [[glomerulonephrosis]]), or a condition that affects the kidney and other parts of the body, called ''secondary'' nephrotic syndrome.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/ascites/ | title= Ascites | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 1 July 2021}}</ref>

=== Primary glomerulonephrosis ===
Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are usually described by their [[histology]]:<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.senefro.org/modules.php?name=subsection&idsection=3&idsubsection=264|title=Descripción histológica de las glomerulonefritis ideopáticas|access-date =8 Sep 2008}}</ref>
* [[Minimal change disease]] (MCD): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It owes its name to the fact that the [[nephron]]s appear normal when viewed with an [[optical microscope]] as the lesions are only visible using an [[electron microscope]].  Another symptom is pronounced proteinuria.
* [[Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] (FSGS): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.<ref name="uptodate" /> It is characterized by the appearance of tissue [[scar]]ring in the glomeruli. The term ''focal'' is used as some of the glomeruli have scars, while others appear intact; the term ''segmental'' refers to the fact that only part of the glomerulus is damaged.
* [[Membranous glomerulonephritis]] (MGN): The inflammation of the glomerular membrane causes increased leaking in the kidney. It is not clear why this condition develops in most people, although an auto-immune mechanism is suspected.<ref name="uptodate">{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics |title=Patient information: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics) |access-date =2013-06-28}}</ref>
* [[Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] (MPGN): is the inflammation of the glomeruli along with the deposit of [[antibody|antibodies]] in their membranes, which makes filtration difficult.
* [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]] (RPGN): (Usually presents as a nephrotic syndrome) A person's glomeruli are present in a ''crescent moon'' shape. It is characterized clinically by a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by at least 50% over a short period, usually from a few days to 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/240457-overview|title = Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|author = James W Lohr, MD|access-date = 2013-06-28}}</ref>

They are considered to be "[[Diagnosis of exclusion|diagnoses of exclusion]]", i.e. they are diagnosed only after secondary causes have been excluded.

=== Secondary glomerulonephrosis ===
[[File:Diabetic glomerulosclerosis (8) PAM.jpg|thumb|235px|Diabetic glomerulonephritis in a person with nephrotic syndrome.]]
Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome have the same histologic patterns as the primary causes, though they may exhibit some differences suggesting a secondary cause, such as [[inclusion bodies]].<ref name="epidemiología" /> They are usually described by the underlying cause, such as:{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
* [[Diabetic nephropathy]]: is a complication that occurs in some [[diabetes|diabetics]]. Excess blood sugar accumulates in the kidney causing them to become inflamed and unable to carry out their normal function. This leads to the leakage of proteins into the urine.
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]: this [[autoimmune disease]] can affect a number of organs, among them the kidney, due to the deposit of [[immune complex|immunocomplexes]] that are typical to this disease. The disease can also cause ''[[lupus nephritis]]''.
* [[Sarcoidosis]]: This disease does not usually affect the kidney but, on occasions, the accumulation of inflammatory [[granuloma]]s (collection of [[immune cell]]s) in the glomeruli can lead to nephrotic syndrome.
* [[Syphilis]]: kidney damage can occur during the secondary stage of this disease (between 2 and 8 weeks from onset).
* [[Hepatitis B]]: certain [[antigen]]s present during hepatitis can accumulate in the kidneys and damage them.
* [[Sjögren's syndrome]]: this autoimmune disease causes the deposit of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli, causing them to become inflamed, this is the same mechanism as occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus.
* [[HIV]]: the virus's antigens provoke an obstruction in the glomerular capillary's lumen that alters normal kidney function.
* [[Amyloidosis]]: the deposit of ''amyloid substances'' (proteins with anomalous structures) in the glomeruli modifying their shape and function.
* [[Multiple myeloma]]: kidney impairment is caused by the accumulation and precipitation of light chains, which form casts in the distal tubules, resulting in kidney obstruction. In addition, myeloma light chains are also directly toxic on proximal kidney tubules, further adding to kidney dysfunction.
* [[Vasculitis]]: inflammation of the blood vessels at a glomerular level impedes the normal blood flow and damages the kidney.
* [[Cancer]]: as happens in myeloma, the invasion of the glomeruli by cancerous cells disturbs their normal functioning.
* [[Genetic disorder]]s: [[congenital nephrotic syndrome]] is a rare [[genetic disorder]]  in which the protein [[nephrin]], a component of the glomerular filtration barrier, is altered.
* [[Drug]]s ( e.g. gold salts, [[penicillin]], [[captopril]]):<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cepvi.com/medicina/enfermedades/sindrome_nefrotico4.shtml|title = Fármacos que pueden producir síndrome nefrótico |access-date =8 Sep 2008}}</ref> gold salts can cause a more or less important loss of proteins in urine as a consequence of metal accumulation. Penicillin is nephrotoxic in people with kidney failure and captopril can aggravate proteinuria.

'''Non-Genetic'''

There is no known genetic cause for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. This is thought to be caused by a hitherto unknown circulating permeability factor that travels in the circulation to the podocyte within the glomerulus of the kidney. This circulating factor damages the podocyte which changes its structure. The podocytes are now less able to restrict urinary protein loss. Despite not knowing the specific indentity of the circulating factor, scientists are learning more about it. It is thought to be either T cell or B cell derived,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=van den Berg |first1=José G. |last2=Weening |first2=Jan J. |date=2004-07-27 |title=Role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/cs20040095 |journal=Clinical Science |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |doi=10.1042/cs20040095 |pmid=15157184 |issn=0143-5221}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=May |first1=Carl J. |last2=Welsh |first2=Gavin I. |last3=Chesor |first3=Musleeha |last4=Lait |first4=Phillipa J. |last5=Schewitz-Bowers |first5=Lauren P. |last6=Lee |first6=Richard W.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Gray1130.svg|thumb|130 px|Drawing of the kidney glomerulus.]]The kidney glomerulus filters the blood that arrives at the [[kidney]]. It is formed of capillaries with small pores that allow small molecules to pass through that have a molecular weight of less than 40,000 [[Dalton (unit)|daltons]],<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://escuela.med.puc.cl/paginas/cursos/tercero/IntegradoTercero/Mec231_38.html|title=Apuntes de fisiopatología de sistemas|access-date=8 Sep 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908021010/http://escuela.med.puc.cl/paginas/Cursos/tercero/IntegradoTercero/Mec231_38.html|archive-date=2008-09-08}}</ref> but not larger macromolecules such as proteins.

In nephrotic syndrome, the glomeruli are affected by an [[inflammation]] or a ''hyalinization'' (the formation of a homogenous crystalline material within cells) that allows proteins such as [[albumin]], [[antithrombin]] or the [[immunoglobulin]]s to pass through the cell membrane and appear in urine.<ref name="scielo" />

Albumin is the main protein in the blood that is able to maintain an [[oncotic pressure]], which prevents the leakage of fluid into the extracellular medium and the subsequent formation of edemas.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

As a response to hypoproteinemia the liver commences a compensatory mechanism involving the synthesis of proteins, such as [[alpha-2 macroglobulin]] and [[lipoprotein]]s.<ref name="scielo" /> An increase in the latter can cause the [[hyperlipidemia]]  associated with this syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Urinbecher.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Urinalysis]] will be able to detect high levels of proteins and occasionally microscopic [[haematuria]].]]
[[File:Ultrasonography of kidney with nephrotic syndrome.jpg|thumb|[[Renal ultrasonography|Ultrasound of a kidney]] with nephrotic syndrome. There is a hyperechoic kidney without demarcation of the cortex and medulla.<ref name=Hansen2015>{{cite journal |last1=Hansen |first1=Kristoffer |last2=Nielsen |first2=Michael |last3=Ewertsen |first3=Caroline |title=Ultrasonography of the Kidney: A Pictorial Review |journal=Diagnostics |date=23 December 2015 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.3390/diagnostics6010002 |pmid=26838799 |pmc=4808817 |doi-access=free }}</ref>]]
Along with obtaining a complete [[medical record|medical history]], a series of [[biochemical]] tests are required in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis that verifies the presence of the illness. In addition, imaging of the kidneys (for structure and presence of two kidneys) is sometimes carried out, and/or a biopsy of the kidneys. The first test will be a urinalysis to test for high levels of proteins,<ref name="mapfre">{{cite web|url = http://www.mapfre.es/salud/es/cinformativo/sindrome-nefrotico.shtml|title = Nefrología y urología|access-date = 12 Sep 2008}}</ref> as a healthy subject excretes an insignificant amount of protein in their urine. The test will involve a 24-hour bedside urinary total protein estimation. The urine sample is tested for [[proteinuria]] (>3.5 g per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per 24 hours). It is also examined for [[urinary casts]], which are more a feature of active nephritis. Next a blood screen, [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP) will look for [[hypoalbuminemia]]: [[albumin]] levels of ≤2.5 g/dL (normal=3.5-5 g/dL). Then a [[Renal function#creatinine clearance|Creatinine Clearance C<sub>Cr</sub>]] test will evaluate kidney function particularly the glomerular filtration capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.urovirtual.net/paciente/saber/rinyones/articulo9.asp|title = El diagnóstico del síndrome nefrótico|access-date = 12 Sep 2008}}</ref> [[Creatinine]] formation is a result of the breakdown of muscular tissue, it is transported in the blood and eliminated in urine. Measuring the concentration of [[organic compounds]] in both liquids evaluates the capacity of the glomeruli to filter blood. [[Electrolytes]] and [[urea]] levels may also be analysed at the same time as [[creatinine]] (EUC test) in order to evaluate kidney function.
A lipid profile will also be carried out as high levels of [[cholesterol]] ([[hypercholesterolemia]]), specifically elevated [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], usually with concomitantly elevated [[Very low density lipoprotein|VLDL]], is indicative of nephrotic syndrome.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

A kidney biopsy may also be used as a more specific and invasive test method. A study of a sample's [[anatomical pathology]] may then allow the identification of the type of glomerulonephritis involved.<ref name="mapfre" /> However, this procedure is usually reserved for adults as the majority of children experience minimal change disease that has a remission rate of 95% with [[corticosteroid]]s.<ref name="biopsia">{{cite journal |url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0370-41062006000300011&script=sci_arttext|title = Indicaciones de la biospsia renal en niños|journal = Revista Chilena de Pediatría|volume = 77|issue = 3|pages = 295–303|access-date = 2008-09-14 |author1=Voguel S, Andrea |author2=Azócar P, Marta |author3=Nazal Ch, Vilma |author4=Salas del C, Paulina |date = June 2006|doi = 10.4067/S0370-41062006000300011|doi-access = free}}</ref> A biopsy is usually only indicated for children that are ''corticosteroid resistant'' as the majority have focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis.<ref name="biopsia" />

Further investigations are indicated if the cause is not clear including analysis of [[auto-immune]] markers ([[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]], [[Antistreptolysin O titre|ASOT]], [[C3 (complement)|C3]], [[cryoglobulin]]s, [[Serum protein electrophoresis|serum electrophoresis]]), or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the whole abdomen.

{{tree chart/end}}

===Differential diagnosis===
Some symptoms that are present in nephrotic syndrome, such as edema and proteinuria, also appear in other illnesses. Therefore, other pathologies need to be excluded in order to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elizalde.gov.ar/area_medica/Normas/nuevas/nefrotico.doc  |title=Diagnóstico diferencial en el síndrome nefrótico  |access-date=2008-09-14  |url-status=bot: unknown  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306092804/http://www.elizalde.gov.ar/area_medica/Normas/nuevas/nefrotico.doc  |archive-date=2009-03-06  }}</ref>
* Edema: in addition to nephrotic syndrome there are two other disorders that often present with edema; these are [[heart failure]] and [[liver failure]].<ref name="manual">{{cite book | last = Harold Friedman| first = H| publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| title = Problem-oriented Medical Diagnosis| edition = Seventh| year = 2001| isbn = 0-7817-2909-2| chapter = General problems | pages = 3 and 4}}</ref> Congestive heart failure can cause [[water retention (medicine)|liquid retention]] in tissues as a consequence of the decrease in the strength of ventricular contractions. The liquid is initially concentrated in the ankles but it subsequently becomes generalized and is called anasarca.<ref name="cepvi">{{cite web|url = http://www.cepvi.com/medicina/enfermedades/insuficiencia_cardiaca.shtml|title = El edema en la insuficiencia cardíaca|access-date = 2008-09-14}}</ref> People with congestive heart failure also experience an abnormal swelling of the heart [[cardiomegaly]], which aids in making a correct diagnosis. Jugular venous pressure can also be elevated and it might be possible to hear heart murmurs. An echocardiogram is the preferred investigation method for these symptoms. Liver failure caused by [[cirrhosis]], hepatitis and other conditions such as alcoholism, IV drug use or some hereditary diseases can lead to swelling in the lower extremities and the abdominal cavity. Other accompanying symptoms include [[jaundice]], dilated veins over umbilicus ([[caput medusae]]), scratch marks (due to widespread itching, known as [[pruritus]]), enlarged spleen, [[spider angiomata]], encephalopathy, bruising, nodular liver and anomalies in the liver function tests.<ref name="cardiología">{{cite book | last = Goldman| first = Lee|author2=Braunwald, Eugene| publisher = Harcourt| title = Cardiología en atención primaria| year = 2000| isbn = 8481744328| chapter = Edemas| pages = 114–117}}</ref> Less frequently symptoms associated with the administration of certain pharmaceutical drugs have to be discounted. These drugs promote the retention of liquid in the extremities such as occurs with [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]], some [[antihypertensive drug]]s, the [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] corticosteroids and sex [[hormone]]s.<ref name="cardiología" />
[[Acute (medicine)|Acute]] [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]] can cause edema in someone with kidney failure. These people are known to have kidney failure, and have either drunk too much or missed their dialysis. In addition, when [[Metastasis|Metastatic cancer]] spreads to the lungs or abdomen it causes effusions and fluid accumulation due to obstruction of lymphatic vessels and veins, as well as serous exudation.
* Proteinuria: the loss of proteins from the urine is caused by many pathological agents and infection by these agents has to be ruled out before it can be certain that a person has nephrotic syndrome. [[Multiple myeloma]] can cause a proteinuria that is not accompanied by hypoalbuminemia, which is an important aid in making a differential diagnosis;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.revistanefrologia.com/mostrarfile.asp?ID=672|title = La proteinuria en el mieloma múltiple|access-date = 2008-09-14|author = Rivera, F|author2 = Egea, J.J|author3 = Jiménez del Cerro, L.A|author4 = Olivares, J}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> other potential causes of proteinuria include [[asthenia]], weight loss or [[bone pain]]. In [[diabetes mellitus]] there is an association between increases in [[glycated hemoglobin]] levels and the appearance of proteinuria.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bvs.sld.cu/revistas/end/vol9_2_98/end05298.htm|title = Relación de la proteinuria con el nivel de hemoglobina glicosilada en los diabéticos|access-date = 2008-09-14|author = Bustillo Solano, Emilio|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080914174622/http://www.bvs.sld.cu/revistas/end/vol9_2_98/end05298.htm|archive-date = 2008-09-14|url-status = dead}}</ref> Other causes are [[amyloidosis]] and certain other allergic and infectious diseases.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of nephrotic syndrome can be symptomatic or can directly address the injuries caused to the kidney.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

=== Symptomatic ===
The objective of this treatment is to treat the imbalances brought about by the illness:<ref name="libro online">{{cite book |last= Curtis|first= Michael J.|author2= Page, Clive P.|author3= Walker, Michael J.A|author4= Hoffman, Brian B. |publisher= Harcourt|title= Farmacología integrada|year= 1998 |isbn= 8481743402|chapter= Fisiopatología y enfermedades renales }}</ref> edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypercoagulability and infectious complications.
* '''Edema''': a return to an unswollen state is the prime objective of this treatment of nephrotic syndrome. It is carried out through the combination of a number of recommendations:
** Rest: depending on the seriousness of the edema and taking into account the risk of thrombosis caused by prolonged bed rest.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.unizar.es/med_naturista/Ejercicio/reposo.pdf|title = El reposo prolongado|author = Saz Peiro, Pablo|access-date = 8 Sep 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090124114336/http://www.unizar.es/med_naturista/Ejercicio/reposo.pdf|archive-date = 24 January 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref>
** [[Medical nutrition therapy]]: based on a [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] with the correct energy intake and balance of proteins that will be used in synthesis processes and not as a source of calories. A total of 35 kcal/kg body weight/day is normally recommended.<ref name="Dietoterapia">{{cite web |url=http://www.nutrar.com/detalle.asp?ID=6135  |title=Dietoterapia del síndrome nefrótico  |access-date=8 Sep 2008  |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122133712/http://www.nutrar.com/detalle.asp?ID=6135  |archive-date=2009-01-22  }}</ref> This diet should also comply with two more requirements: the first is to not consume more than 1 [[gram|g]] of protein/kg body weight/ day,<ref name = "Dietoterapia" /> as a greater amount could increase the degree of proteinuria and cause a negative nitrogen balance.<ref name="balancenitrógeno">{{cite web|url = http://angiejr3.tripod.com/id4.html|title = Balance de nitrógeno y equilibrio nitrogenado|quote = It occurs during renal pathologies, during fasting, in eating disorders or during heavy physical exercise. |access-date =8 Sep 2008}}</ref> People are usually recommended lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry. The second guideline requires that the amount of water ingested is not greater than the level of [[fluid balance|diuresis]]. In order to facilitate this, the consumption of salt must also be controlled, as this contributes to water retention. It is advisable to restrict the ingestion of sodium to 1 or 2 g/day, which means that salt cannot be used in cooking and salty foods should also be avoided.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.botanical-online.com/alimentosconmuchasal.htm|title = Lista de alimentos ricos en sodio|access-date =8 Sep 2008}}</ref> Foods high in sodium include seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, luncheon meats including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings.  On food labels, compare milligrams of sodium to calories per serving.  Sodium should be less than or equal to calories per serving.
** [[Pharmacology|Medication]]: The pharmacological treatment of edema is based on [[diuretic|diuretic medications]] (especially [[loop diuretics]], such as [[furosemide]]). In severe cases of edema (or in cases with physiological repercussions, such as [[scrotum|scrotal]], [[Foreskin|preputial]] or [[urethra]]l edema) or in people with one of a number of severe infections (such as [[sepsis]] or [[pleural effusion]]), the diuretics can be administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. This occurs where the risk from plasmatic expansion<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.udomfyc.org/descarga/sesiones/2006y7/fluidoterapia.pdf|title = Fluidoterapia: tipos de expansores|quote = Plasma expanders are natural or synthetic substances (dextran, albumin...), that are able to retain liquid in the vascular space.|access-date = 8 Sep 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920190812/http://www.udomfyc.org/descarga/sesiones/2006y7/fluidoterapia.pdf|archive-date = 2008-09-20}}</ref> is considered greater than the risk of severe hypovolemia, which can be caused by the strong diuretic action of intravenous treatment. The procedure is the following:
:# Analyse [[haemoglobin]] and [[haematocrit]] levels.
:# A solution of 25% albumin is used that is administered for only 4 hours in order to avoid pulmonary edema.
:# Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels are analysed again: if the haematocrit value is less than the initial value (a sign of correct expansion) the diuretics are administered for at least 30 minutes. If the haematocrit level is greater than the initial one this is a contraindication for the use of diuretics as they would increase said value.
:It may be necessary to give a person [[potassium]] or require a change in dietary habits if the diuretic drug causes [[hypokalaemia]] as a side effect.
* '''Hypoalbuminemia''': is treated using the medical nutrition therapy described as a treatment for edema. It includes a moderate intake of foods rich in animal proteins.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cun.es/areadesalud/tu-salud/nutricion-y-salud/alimentos-ricos-en-proteinas/|title = Lista de alimentos ricos en proteínas|quote = Expressed as grams per 100 g of food.|access-date = 8 Sep 2008|archive-date = 7 September 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907234432/http://www.cun.es/areadesalud/tu-salud/nutricion-y-salud/alimentos-ricos-en-proteinas/|url-status = dead}}</ref>
* '''Hyperlipidaemia''': depending on the seriousness of the condition it can be treated with medical nutrition therapy as the only treatment or combined with drug therapy. The ingestion of cholesterol should be less than 300&nbsp;mg/day,<ref name = "Dietoterapia" /> which will require a switch to foods that are low in [[saturated fat]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tusalud.com.mx/221005.htm |title=Sustitución de los alimentos ricos en grasas de la dieta |quote=Organizations in the US recommend that no more than 30% of total daily calorie intake is from fats. |access-date= 8 Sep 2008 |url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212091444/http://www.tusalud.com.mx/221005.htm |archive-date=February 12, 2008 }}</ref> Avoid saturated fats such as butter, cheese, fried foods, fatty cuts of red meat, egg yolks, and poultry skin.  Increase unsaturated fat intake, including olive oil, canola oil, peanut butter, avocadoes, fish and nuts.

* '''Infectious complications''': an appropriate course of [[antibacterial]] drugs can be taken according to the infectious agent.

In addition to these key imbalances, vitamin D and calcium are also taken orally in case the alteration of vitamin D causes severe hypocalcaemia, this treatment has the goal of restoring physiological levels of calcium in the person.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fisterra.com/guias2/hipocalcemia.asp|title = Tratamiento de la hipocalcemia|access-date = 2008-09-14|archive-date = 2008-09-15|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080915104856/http://www.fisterra.com/guias2/hipocalcemia.asp|url-status = dead}}</ref>
* Achieving better blood glucose level control if the person is diabetic.
* [[Blood pressure]] control. [[ACE inhibitors]] are the drug of choice. Independent of their blood pressure-lowering effect, they have been shown to decrease protein loss.

===Kidney damage===
The treatment of kidney damage may reverse or delay the progression of the disease.<ref name="libro online" /> Kidney damage is treated by prescribing drugs:
* '''[[Corticosteroids]]''': the result is a decrease in proteinuria and the risk of infection as well as a resolution of the edema.<ref name="pmid17943754">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hahn D, Hodson EM, Willis NS, Craig JC |year=2015|title=Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2015 |issue=3|pages=CD001533|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001533.pub5|pmid=25785660|pmc=7025788}}</ref> [[Prednisone]] is usually prescribed at a dose of 60&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area/day in a first treatment for 4–8 weeks. After this period the dose is reduced to 40&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> for a further 4 weeks. People experiencing a relapse or children are treated with prednisolone 2&nbsp;mg/kg/day until urine becomes negative for protein. Then, 1.5&nbsp;mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Frequent relapses treated by: [[cyclophosphamide]] or nitrogen mustard or cyclosporin or [[levamisole]]. People can respond to prednisone in a number of different ways:
** People with Corticosteroid sensitive or early steroid-responder: the subject responds to the corticosteroids in the first 8 weeks of treatment. This is demonstrated by a strong diuresis and the disappearance of edemas, and also by a negative test for proteinuria in three urine samples taken during the night.
** People with Corticosteroid resistance or late steroid-responder: the proteinuria persists after the 8-week treatment. The lack of response is indicative of the seriousness of the glomerular damage, which could develop into chronic kidney failure.
** People with Corticosteroid intolerant: complications such as [[hypertension]] appear, and they gain a lot of weight and can develop aseptic or [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[hip]] or [[knee]],<ref>According to MedlinePlus, avascular necrosis is the ''death of the bone caused by insufficient blood supply to the bone.</ref> [[cataract]]s and thrombotic phenomena and/or [[embolism]]s.
** People with Corticosteroid dependent: proteinuria appears when the dose of corticosteroid is decreased or there is a relapse in the first two weeks after treatment is completed.

The susceptibility testing in vitro to glucocorticoids on the person's peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with the number of new cases of not optimal clinical responses: the most sensitive people in vitro have shown a higher number of cases of corticodependence, while the most resistant people in vitro showed a higher number of cases of ineffective therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cuzzoni |first1=E |last2=De Iudicibus |first2=S |last3= Stocco |first3=G |last4=Favretto |first4=D |year=2016 |title=In Vitro sensitivity to methyl-prednisolone is associated with clinical response in pediatric idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. |journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=268–74 |doi=10.1002/cpt.372 |pmid=27007551|hdl=11368/2878528 |s2cid=37671642 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>
* [[Immunosupressor]]s ([[cyclophosphamide]]): only indicated in recurring nephrotic syndrome in corticosteroid dependent or intolerant people. In the first two cases, the proteinuria has to be negated before treatment with the immunosuppressor can begin, which involves a prolonged treatment with prednisone. The negation of the proteinuria indicates the exact moment when treatment with cyclophosphamide can begin. The treatment is continued for 8 weeks at a dose of 3&nbsp;mg/kg/day, the immunosuppression is halted after this period. In order to be able to start this treatment the person should not have [[neutropenia]] nor anaemia, which would cause further complications. A possible [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of the cyclophosphamide is [[Baldness|alopecia]]. [[Complete blood count]] tests are carried out during the treatment in order to give advance warning of a possible infection.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for nephrotic syndrome under treatment is generally good although this depends on the underlying cause, the age of the person and their response to treatment. It is usually good in children, because [[minimal change disease]] responds very well to [[steroids]] and does not cause [[Chronic kidney disease|chronic kidney failure]]. Any relapses that occur become less frequent over time;<ref name="aeped">{{cite web|url = http://www.aeped.es/infofamilia/temas/sdnefrotico2.htm|title = Pronóstico de la enfermedad|access-date = 2016-05-21|author = Guerrero Fernández, J }}</ref> the opposite occurs with [[mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis]], in which the kidney fails within three years of the disease developing, making [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]] necessary and subsequent [[kidney transplant]].<ref name="aeped" /> In addition children under the age of 5 generally have a poorer prognosis than prepubescents, as do adults older than 30 years of age as they have a greater risk of kidney failure.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://bvs.sld.cu/revistas/med/vol34_3_95/med02395.htm|title = Síndrome nefrótico idiopático: diagnóstico histológico por biopsia renal percutanea|date = 1995|access-date = 2016-05-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160325041430/http://www.bvs.sld.cu/revistas/med/vol34_3_95/med02395.htm|archive-date = 2016-03-25|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Other causes such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] frequently lead to [[chronic kidney disease|end stage kidney disease]]. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis in these cases include level of [[proteinuria]], [[blood pressure]] control and kidney function ([[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Without treatment nephrotic syndrome has a very bad prognosis especially ''rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis'', which leads to acute kidney failure after a few months.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

== Epidemiology ==
Nephrotic syndrome can affect any age, although it is mainly found in adults with a ratio of adults to children of 26 to 1.<ref name = "epi">{{cite book |last1= Borrego R.|first1= Jaime |last2= Montero C. |first2= Orlando|publisher= Corporación para investigaciones biológicas|title= Nefrología: Fundamentos de medicina|edition= Cuarta|year= 2003|isbn= 9589400639|page= 340}}</ref>

The syndrome presents in different ways in the two groups: the most frequent glomerulopathy in children is [[minimal change disease]] (66% of cases), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (8%) and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (6%).<ref name="epidemiología">{{cite web|url = http://sabanet.unisabana.edu.co/medicina/semestre7/medinterna_I/guis2005-2/SINDROMES%2520GLOMERULARES%25202.doc|title = Frecuencia de las glomerulonefritis y causas de las glomerulonefritis secundarias|access-date = 8 Sep 2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In adults the most common disease is mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (30-40%), followed by focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis (15-25%) and minimal change disease (20%). The latter usually presents as secondary and not primary as occurs in children. Its main cause is diabetic nephropathy.<ref name="epidemiología" /> It usually presents in a person from their 40s or 50s.
Of the glomerulonephritis cases, approximately 60% to 80% are primary, while the remainder are secondary.<ref name="epi" />

There are also differences in epidemiology between the sexes, the disease is more common in men than in women by a ratio of 2 to 1.<ref name="epi" />

The [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data also reveals information regarding the most common way that symptoms develop in people with nephrotic syndrome:<ref name="epi" /> spontaneous remission occurs in up to 20% or 30% of cases during the first year of the illness. However, this improvement is not definitive as some 50% to 60% of people with Nephrotic syndrome die and/or develop chronic kidney failure 6 to 14 years after this remission. On the other hand, between 10% and 20% of people have continuous episodes of remissions and [[relapse]]s without dying or jeopardizing their kidney. The main causes of death are cardiovascular, as a result of the chronicity of the syndrome, and thromboembolic accidents.
