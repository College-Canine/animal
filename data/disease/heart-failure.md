'''Heart failure''' ('''HF'''), also known as '''congestive heart failure''' ('''CHF'''), is a [[syndrome]] caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood. Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with [[shortness of breath]], [[Fatigue (medical)|excessive fatigue]], and bilateral [[peripheral edema|leg swelling]].<ref name="NICE2018ch2">{{Cite book |last=National Guideline Centre (UK) |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536089/ |title=Chronic Heart Failure in Adults: Diagnosis and Management |chapter=2.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Heartfailure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Signs and symptoms of severe heart failure]]
Congestive heart failure is a [[pathophysiological]] condition in which the [[cardiac output|heart's output]] is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs.<ref name="NICE2010chp1" /> The term "congestive heart failure" is often used because one of the most common symptoms is [[wikt:congestion#Noun|congestion]] or fluid accumulation in the tissues and veins of the lungs or other parts of a person's body.<ref name="NICE2010chp1" /> Congestion manifests itself particularly in the form of [[edema|fluid accumulation and swelling (edema)]], in the form of [[peripheral edema]] (causing swollen limbs and feet) and [[pulmonary edema]] (causing difficulty breathing) and [[ascites]] (swollen abdomen).<ref name="Thibodeau2018">{{cite journal| author=Thibodeau JT, Drazner MH| title=The Role of the Clinical Examination in Patients With Heart Failure. | journal=JACC Heart Fail | year= 2018 | volume= 6 | issue= 7 | pages= 543–551 | pmid=29885957 | doi=10.1016/j.jchf.2018.04.005 | pmc= | doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Pulse pressure]], which is the difference between the systolic ("top number") and diastolic ("bottom number") blood pressures, is often low/narrow (i.e. 25% or less of the level of the systolic) in people with heart failure, and this can be an early warning sign.<ref name="Cleveland Clinic 2021">{{cite web |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21629-pulse-pressure |title=Pulse pressure |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 July 2021 |publisher=Cleveland Clinic |access-date=10 February 2023 |quote=A narrow pulse pressure — sometimes called a low pulse pressure — is where your pulse pressure is one-fourth or less of your systolic pressure (the top number).

Symptoms of heart failure are traditionally divided into left-sided and right-sided because the left and right ventricles supply different parts of the circulation. In biventricular heart failure, both sides of the heart are affected. Left-sided heart failure is the more common.<ref name="IQWiG2018"/>

===Left-sided failure===
The left side of the heart takes oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the [[circulatory system]] in the body (except for the [[pulmonary circulation]]). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up into the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and fatigue due to an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs include [[tachypnea|increased respiratory rate]] and labored breathing (nonspecific signs of shortness of breath). [[Rales]] or crackles heard initially in the lung bases and when severe in all [[lung fields]] indicate the development of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]). [[Cyanosis]], indicates [[hypoxemia|deficiency of oxygen in the blood]], is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Adeyinka |first1=Adebayo |title=Cyanosis |date=2022 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482247/ |work=StatPearls |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=29489181 |access-date=2022-05-11 |last2=Kondamudi |first2=Noah P. |archive-date=13 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210313021701/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482247/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Other signs of left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced [[apex beat]] (which occurs when the heart is enlarged) and a [[gallop rhythm]] (additional heart sounds), which may be heard as a sign of increased blood flow or increased intracardiac pressure. [[Heart murmur]]s may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g., [[aortic stenosis]]) or as a consequence (e.g., [[mitral regurgitation]]) of heart failure.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Heart Murmur: Types & Causes |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17083-heart-murmur |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=Cleveland Clinic |archive-date=28 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221128033026/https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17083-heart-murmur |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Reverse'' insufficiency of the left ventricle causes congestion in the blood vessels of the lungs, so that symptoms are predominantly respiratory. Reverse insufficiency can be divided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle, or both within the left circuit. Patients will experience [[dyspnea|shortness of breath (dyspnea)]] on exertion and, in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness while lying down, called [[orthopnea]], also occurs. It can be measured by the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, with extreme cases of orthopnea forcing the patient to sleep sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]: a sudden nocturnal attack of severe shortness of breath, usually occurring several hours after falling asleep.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is Exercise Intolerance? |url=https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/what-to-know-about-exercise-intolerance |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=WebMD |language=en |archive-date=11 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220511094156/https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/what-to-know-about-exercise-intolerance |url-status=live }}</ref> There may be "[[cardiac asthma]]" or [[wheezing]]. Impaired left ventricular ''forward'' function can lead to symptoms of poor systemic perfusion such as [[dizziness]], [[confusion]], and cool extremities at rest. Loss of consciousness may also occur due to loss of blood supply to the brain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Heart Failure Signs and Symptoms |url=https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/warning-signs-of-heart-failure |website=heart.org |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=16 November 2022 |archive-date=17 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221117045606/https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/warning-signs-of-heart-failure |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Right-sided failure===
[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Severe peripheral pitting edema]]

Right-sided heart failure is often caused by [[pulmonary heart disease]] (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by issues with [[pulmonary circulation]] such as [[pulmonary hypertension]] or [[pulmonic stenosis]].

''Backward'' failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin ([[peripheral edema]] or [[anasarca]]) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first, causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up and [[Sacrum|sacral]] edema in people who are predominantly lying down. [[Nocturia]] (frequent night-time urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function ([[congestive hepatopathy]]), jaundice, and [[coagulopathy]] (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Alcantara |first1=Camille Abigael P. |last2=Chandra |first2=Anjali |last3=Morvey |first3=Diana |last4=von Schwarz |first4=Ernst R. |title=Right Heart Pathology |chapter=Acute Right Heart Failure |date=2018-01-03 |pages=215–225 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73764-5_10 |pmc=7123149|isbn=978-3-319-73763-8 }}</ref>

===Biventricular failure===
Dullness of the lung fields when [[percussion (medicine)|percussed]] and reduced breath sounds at the base of the lungs may suggest the development of a [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection [[pleural cavity|between the lung and the chest wall]]). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right-sided.<ref name="pmid26350935">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatnagar R, Maskell N | title = The modern diagnosis and management of pleural effusions | journal = BMJ | volume = 351 | issue =  | pages = h4520 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26350935 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.h4520 | hdl = 1983/deeb861e-d752-4e4c-a8d7-f00cc22eddac | s2cid = 1883969 | url = https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/deeb861e-d752-4e4c-a8d7-f00cc22eddac | access-date = 13 February 2023 | archive-date = 9 August 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230809061730/https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/the-modern-diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-effusions | url-status = live | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Though still harmful, right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the left side.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sayer |first1=Gabriel |last2=Semigran |first2=Marc J. |title=Heart Failure |chapter=Acute and Chronic Right Ventricular Failure |date=2017-02-22 |pages=65–84 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-4219-5_4 |pmc=7122716|isbn=978-1-4471-4218-8 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of heart failure}}
[[File:Right side heart failure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Model of a normal heart (left); and a weakened heart, with over-stretched muscle and dilation of [[left ventricle]] (right); both during [[diastole]]]] Heart failure is caused by any condition that reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or [[Volume overload|overloading]]. Over time, these increases in workload, which are mediated by long-term activation of neurohormonal systems such as the [[renin–angiotensin system]] and the sympathoadrenal system, lead to [[fibrosis]], dilation, and structural changes in the shape of the left ventricle from elliptical to spherical.<ref name="Lancet2017"/>

The heart of a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of contraction due to overloading of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. In a normal heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force by the [[Frank–Starling law of the heart]], and thus a rise in [[cardiac output]]. In heart failure, this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient. This is due to reduced ability to cross-link [[actin]] and [[myosin]] [[myofilament]]s in over-stretched heart muscle.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Boron WF, Boulpaep EL |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach |publisher=Saunders |edition=Updated |year=2005  |isbn=978-0-7216-3256-8 |page=533 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
No diagnostic criteria have been agreed on as the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for heart failure, especially [[heart failure with preserved ejection fraction]] (HFpEF).

In the [[UK]], the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends measuring [[N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide|N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP)]] followed by an [[echocardiography|ultrasound of the heart]] if positive.<ref name="NICE2018ch1"/> In [[Europe]], the [[European Society of Cardiology]], and in the United States, the [[American Heart Association|AHA]]/[[American College of Cardiology|ACC]]/[[Heart Failure Society of America|HFSA]], recommend measuring NT-proBNP or BNP followed by an [[echocardiography|ultrasound of the heart]] if positive.<ref name="ESC2021"/><ref name="AHA2022"/> This is recommended in those with symptoms consistent with heart failure such as [[shortness of breath]].<ref name="AHA2022"/>

The [[European Society of Cardiology]] defines the diagnosis of heart failure as symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure in combination with "objective evidence of cardiac structural or functional abnormalities".<ref name="ESC2021"/> This definition is consistent with an international 2021 report termed "Universal Definition of Heart Failure".<ref name="ESC2021"/>{{rp|p=3613}} Score-based algorithms have been developed to help in the diagnosis of [[heart failure with preserved ejection fraction|HFpEF]], which can be challenging for physicians to diagnose.<ref name="ESC2021"/>{{rp|p=3630}} The [[American Heart Association|AHA]]/[[American College of Cardiology|ACC]]/[[Heart Failure Society of America|HFSA]] defines heart failure as symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure in combination with shown "structural and functional alterations of the heart as the underlying cause for the clinical presentation", for HFmrEF and HFpEF specifically requiring "evidence of spontaneous or provokable increased left ventricle filling pressures".<ref name="AHA2022"/>{{rp|pages=e276–e277}}

=== Classification ===
==== "Left", "right" and mixed heart failure ====
One historical method of categorizing heart failure is by the side of the heart involved (left heart failure versus right heart failure). Right heart failure was thought to compromise blood flow to the lungs compared to left heart failure compromising blood flow to the [[aorta]] and consequently to the brain and the remainder of the body's systemic circulation. However, mixed presentations are common and left heart failure is a common cause of right heart failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_failure/signs_and_symptoms.html|title=Heart Failure: Signs and Symptoms|publisher=UCSF Medical Center|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080141/http://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/heart_failure/signs_and_symptoms.html|archive-date=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==== By ejection fraction ====
More accurate classification of heart failure type is made by measuring [[ejection fraction]], or the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart during a single contraction.<ref name="HRS2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsonline.org/Patient-Resources/The-Normal-Heart/Ejection-Fraction#axzz31jSSC7Uo|title=Ejection Fraction|website=Heart Rhythm Society|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502123346/http://www.hrsonline.org/Patient-Resources/The-Normal-Heart/Ejection-Fraction#axzz31jSSC7Uo|archive-date=2 May 2014|access-date=7 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ejection fraction is given as a percentage with the normal range being between 50 and 75%.<ref name="HRS2014" /> The types are:

Heart failure may also be classified as acute or chronic. Chronic heart failure is a long-term condition, usually kept stable by the treatment of symptoms. [[Acute decompensated heart failure]] is a worsening of chronic heart failure symptoms, which can result in [[acute respiratory distress]].<ref name="Jessup2009">{{cite journal|display-authors=6|vauthors=Jessup M, Abraham WT, Casey DE, Feldman AM, Francis GS, Ganiats TG, Konstam MA, Mancini DM, Rahko PS, Silver MA, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW|date=April 2009|title=2009 focused update: ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure in Adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines: developed in collaboration with the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation|journal=Circulation|volume=119|issue=14|pages=1977–2016|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192064|pmid=19324967|doi-access=}}</ref> [[High-output heart failure]] can occur when there is increased cardiac demand that results in increased left ventricular diastolic pressure which can develop into pulmonary congestion (pulmonary edema).<ref name="ReferenceA">{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953450|high-output heart failure}}</ref>

Several terms are closely related to heart failure and may be the cause of heart failure, but should not be confused with it. [[Cardiac arrest]] and [[asystole]] refer to situations in which no cardiac output occurs at all. Without urgent treatment, these events result in sudden death. Myocardial infarction ("Heart attack") refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked [[coronary artery]]. Cardiomyopathy refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure.<ref name="pmid36356656">{{cite journal |vauthors=Somma V, Ha FJ, Palmer S, Mohamed U, Agarwal S |title=Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of definition, prevalence, risk factors, and management |journal=Heart Rhythm |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages= 282–290|date=October 2022 |pmid=36356656 |doi=10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.09.019 |s2cid=253409509 |url=}}</ref> Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is coronary artery disease.

===Ultrasound===
An [[echocardiogram]] ([[ultrasound]] of the heart) is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This can determine the [[stroke volume]] (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the [[end-diastolic volume]] (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the [[ejection fraction]] (EF). In pediatrics, the [[shortening fraction]] is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50 and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the [[pericardium]] (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding specific treatments, such as medication, insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], or [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]]. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sirajuddin |first1=Arlene |last2=Mirmomen |first2=S.

===Chest X-ray===
[[File:Chest radiograph with signs of congestive heart failure - annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Chest radiograph]] of a lung with distinct [[Kerley lines|Kerley B lines]], as well as an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] (as shown by an increased [[cardiothoracic ratio]], cephalization of pulmonary veins, and minor [[pleural effusion]] as seen for example in the right [[Horizontal fissure of right lung|horizontal fissure]]. Yet, no obvious lung edema is seen. Overall, this indicates intermediate severity (stage II) heart failure.]]
[[Chest X-ray]]s are frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of CHF. In a person who is compensated, this may show [[cardiomegaly]] (visible enlargement of the heart), quantified as the [[cardiothoracic ratio]] (proportion of the heart size to the chest). In left ventricular failure, evidence may exist of vascular redistribution (upper lobe blood diversion or cephalization), [[Kerley lines]], [[peribronchial cuffing|cuffing of the areas around]] the [[bronchi]], and interstitial edema. Ultrasound of the lung may also be able to detect Kerley lines.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al Deeb M, Barbic S, Featherstone R, Dankoff J, Barbic D | title = Point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients presenting with acute dyspnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 843–52 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25176151 | doi = 10.1111/acem.12435 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Electrophysiology===
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG or EKG) may be used to identify [[arrhythmia]]s, [[ischemic heart disease]], [[right ventricular hypertrophy|right]] and [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], and presence of conduction delay or abnormalities (e.g. [[left bundle branch block]]). Although these findings are not specific to the diagnosis of heart failure, a normal ECG virtually excludes left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |edition=17 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2008 |page=1447 |isbn=978-0-07-147693-5 }}</ref>

===Blood tests===
[[N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide|N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP)]] is the favoured biomarker for the diagnosis of heart failure, according to guidelines published 2018 by [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|NICE]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name="NICE2018ch2"/> [[Brain natriuretic peptide 32]] (BNP) is another biomarker commonly tested for heart failure.<ref name="NICE2018ch5">{{Cite book |last=National Guideline Centre (UK) |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536086/ |title=Chronic Heart Failure in Adults: Diagnosis and Management |chapter=5.

Additionally, NT-proBNP or BNP can be used to differentiate between causes of dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes of dyspnea. If myocardial infarction is suspected, various [[cardiac marker]]s may be used.

[[Blood test]]s routinely performed include [[electrolyte]]s ([[sodium]], [[potassium]]), measures of [[kidney function]], [[liver function tests]], [[thyroid function test]]s, a [[complete blood count]], and often [[C-reactive protein]] if infection is suspected.

[[Hyponatremia]] (low serum sodium concentration) is common in heart failure. [[Vasopressin]] levels are usually increased, along with renin, angiotensin II, and catecholamines to compensate for reduced circulating volume due to inadequate cardiac output. This leads to increased fluid and sodium retention in the body; the rate of fluid retention is higher than the rate of sodium retention in the body, this phenomenon causes hypervolemic hyponatremia (low sodium concentration due to high body fluid retention). This phenomenon is more common in older women with low body mass. Severe hyponatremia can result in accumulation of fluid in the brain, causing [[cerebral edema]] and [[intracranial hemorrhage]].<ref name="US cardiology 2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Abraham WT |title=Managing hyponatremia in heart failure |journal=US Cardiology Review |date=2008 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=57–60 |doi=10.15420/usc.2008.5.1.57 |url=https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/managing-hyponatremia-heart-failure |access-date=16 January 2018 |doi-access=free |archive-date=16 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211116040441/https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/managing-hyponatremia-heart-failure |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Angiography===
[[Angiography]] is the [[X-ray]] imaging of [[blood vessel]]s, which is done by injecting contrast agents into the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] through a thin plastic tube ([[catheter]]), which is placed directly in the blood vessel. X-ray images are called angiograms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insideradiology.com.au/angiography/|title=Angiography – Consumer Information – InsideRadiology|date=2016-09-23|work=InsideRadiology|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822134640/https://www.insideradiology.com.au/angiography/|archive-date=22 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Heart failure may be the result of coronary artery disease, and its prognosis depends in part on the ability of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] to supply blood to the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle). As a result, [[coronary catheterization]] may be used to identify possibilities for revascularisation through [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

===Staging===
Heart failure is commonly stratified by the degree of functional impairment conferred by the severity of the heart failure, as reflected in the [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Criteria Committee, New York Heart Association |title=Diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Nomenclature and criteria for diagnosis |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1964 |page=114 |edition=6th}}</ref> The NYHA functional classes (I–IV) begin with class I, which is defined as a person who experiences no limitation in any activities and has no symptoms from ordinary activities. People with NYHA class II heart failure have slight, mild limitations with everyday activities; the person is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion. With NYHA class III heart failure, a marked limitation occurs with any activity; the person is comfortable only at rest. A person with NYHA class IV heart failure is symptomatic at rest and becomes quite uncomfortable with any physical activity. This score documents the severity of symptoms and can be used to assess response to treatment. While its use is widespread, the NYHA score is not very reproducible and does not reliably predict the walking distance or exercise tolerance on formal testing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raphael C, Briscoe C, Davies J, Ian Whinnett Z, Manisty C, Sutton R, Mayet J, Francis DP | title = Limitations of the New York Heart Association functional classification system and self-reported walking distances in chronic heart failure | journal = Heart | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–82 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17005715 | pmc = 1861501 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.2006.089656 }}</ref>

In its 2001 guidelines, the [[American College of Cardiology]]/[[American Heart Association]] working group introduced four stages of heart failure:<ref name="Hunt-2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunt SA, Abraham WT, Chin MH, Feldman AM, Francis GS, Ganiats TG, Jessup M, Konstam MA, Mancini DM, Michl K, Oates JA, Rahko PS, Silver MA, Stevenson LW, Yancy CW, Antman EM, Smith SC, Adams CD, Anderson JL, Faxon DP, Fuster V, Halperin JL, Hiratzka LF, Jacobs AK, Nishimura R, Ornato JP, Page RL, Riegel B | display-authors = 6 | title = ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Update the 2001 Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Heart Failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 12 | pages = e154–235 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16160202 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.167586 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* Stage A: People at high risk for developing HF in the future, but no functional or structural heart disorder
* Stage B: A structural heart disorder, but no symptoms at any stage
* Stage C: Previous or current symptoms of heart failure in the context of an underlying structural heart problem, but managed with medical treatment
* Stage D: Advanced disease requiring hospital-based support, a heart transplant, or [[palliative care]]

The ACC staging system is useful since stage A encompasses "pre-heart failure" – a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms. ACC stage A does not have a corresponding NYHA class. ACC stage B would correspond to NYHA class I. ACC stage C corresponds to NYHA class II and III, while ACC stage D overlaps with NYHA class IV.
* The degree of coexisting illness: i.e. heart failure/systemic hypertension, heart failure/pulmonary hypertension, heart failure/diabetes, heart failure/kidney failure, etc.
* Whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure ([[Preload (cardiology)|preload]]), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion ([[afterload]])
* Whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high [[systemic vascular resistance]] or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low-output heart failure vs. high-output heart failure)

===Histopathology===
[[File:Histopathology of pulmonary congestion and siderophages.jpg|thumb|Siderophages (one indicated by white arrow) and pulmonary congestion, indicating left [[congestive heart failure]]]]
[[Histopathology]] can diagnose heart failure in [[autopsy|autopsies]]. The presence of [[siderophage]]s indicates chronic left-sided heart failure, but is not [[sensitivity and specificity|specific]] for it.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Guido Majno|author2=Isabelle Joris|title=Cells, Tissues, and Disease: Principles of General Pathology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yAf6U7njlcC&pg=PA620|access-date=19 March 2013|date=12 August 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974892-1|page=620}}</ref> It is also indicated by congestion of the pulmonary circulation.

==Prevention==
A person's risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to level of [[Physical exercise|physical activity]]. Those who achieved at least 500 [[metabolic equivalent|MET-minutes/week]] (the recommended minimum by U.S. guidelines) had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time; the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum.<ref name=Pandey2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pandey A, Garg S, Khunger M, Darden D, Ayers C, Kumbhani DJ, Mayo HG, de Lemos JA, Berry JD |display-authors=6 |title=Dose-Response Relationship Between Physical Activity and Risk of Heart Failure: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Circulation |volume=132 |issue=19 |pages=1786–1794 |date=November 2015 | pmid = 26438781 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.015853|doi-access=free }}</ref>
Heart failure can also be prevented by lowering high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and by controlling diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight, and decreasing sodium, alcohol, and sugar intake, may help. Additionally, avoiding tobacco use has been shown to lower the risk of heart failure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/tc/heart-failure-prevention |title=Heart Failure: Am I at Risk, and Can I Prevent It? |newspaper=Webmd |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-date=30 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212317/https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/tc/heart-failure-prevention |url-status=live }}</ref> According to [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] and the [[American Heart Association]] there are a few ways to help to prevent a cardiac event. Johns Hopkins states that stopping tobacco use, reducing high blood pressure, physical activity and your diet can drastically effect the chances of developing heart disease. High blood pressure accounts for most cardiovascular deaths. High blood pressure can be lowered into the normal range by making dietary decisions such as consuming less salt. Exercise also helps to bring blood pressure back down. One of the best ways to help avoid heart failure is to promote healthier eating habits like eating more vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean protein.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2019 Updated Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Guidelines Announced - Johns Hopkins Medicine |url=http://clinicalconnection.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/2019-updated-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-guidelines-announced |access-date=2022-04-29 |website=clinicalconnection.hopkinsmedicine.org |date=17 March 2019 |language=en |archive-date=5 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705093722/https://clinicalconnection.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/2019-updated-cardiovascular-disease-prevention-guidelines-announced |url-status=live }}</ref>

Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart failure. For women with Coronary Heart disease (CHD), diabetes was the strongest risk factor for heart failure.<ref>Thom, T., Haase, N., Rosamond, W., Howard, V., Rumsfeld, J., & Manolio, T. et al. (2006).

==Management==
{{main|Management of heart failure}}
Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease. Reversible causes of heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. [[infection]], alcohol ingestion, anemia, [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], and hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities, and occasionally various forms of device therapy. Rarely, cardiac transplantation is used as an effective treatment when heart failure has reached the end stage.<ref name="pmid33069454">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cebeci F, Arikan B, Catal E, Bayezid O | title = A bridge to transplantation: The life experiences of patients with a left ventricular assist device | journal = Heart & Lung | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–112 | date = 2021 | pmid = 33069454 | doi = 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2020.09.020 | s2cid = 224780668 }}</ref>

===Acute decompensation===
{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}
In [[acute decompensated heart failure]], the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] are adequate. Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as [[Nitroglycerin (medication)|nitroglycerin]], diuretics such as [[furosemide]], and possibly [[noninvasive positive pressure ventilation]]. [[Oxygen therapy|Supplemental oxygen]] is indicated in those with oxygen saturation levels below 90%, but is not recommended in those with normal oxygen levels in normal atmosphere.<ref name=Pre2018>{{cite journal |title=Acute heart failure with dyspnoea. First-choice treatments |journal=Prescrire International |date=2018 |volume=27 |issue=194 |pages=160–162}}</ref>

===Chronic management===

The goals of the treatment for people with chronic heart failure are the prolongation of life, prevention of acute decompensation, and reduction of symptoms, allowing for greater activity.

Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. In considering therapeutic options, excluding reversible causes is of primary importance, including [[thyroid disease]], [[anemia]], chronic [[tachycardia]], [[alcohol use disorder]], [[hypertension]], and dysfunction of one or more [[heart valves]]. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. In the majority of cases, though, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, [[behavioral treatments|behavioral]], [[Medical treatment|medical]] and [[medical device|device]] treatment strategies exist that can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of [[hospitalization]] or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component. Rehabilitation should also include other interventions to address shortness of breath including psychological and educational needs of people and needs of caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Man WD, Chowdhury F, Taylor RS, Evans RA, Doherty P, Singh SJ, Booth S, Thomason D, Andrews D, Lee C, Hanna J, Morgan MD, Bell D, Cowie MR | display-authors = 6 | title = Building consensus for provision of breathlessness rehabilitation for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure | journal = Chronic Respiratory Disease | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–39 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27072018 | pmc = 5029782 | doi = 10.1177/1479972316642363 }}</ref> [[Iron supplementation]] appears to reduce hospitalization but not all-cause mortality in patients with iron deficiency and heart

====Exercise and physical activity====
Exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit individual's capabilities. A meta-analysis found that centre-based group interventions delivered by a physiotherapist are helpful in promoting physical activity in HF.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amirova A, Fteropoulli T, Williams P, Haddad M | title = Efficacy of interventions to increase physical activity for people with heart failure: a meta-analysis | language = English | journal = Open Heart | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e001687 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 34108272 | pmc = 8191629 | doi = 10.1136/openhrt-2021-001687 | oclc = 9066065537 }}</ref> There is a need for additional training for physiotherapists in delivering behaviour change intervention alongside an exercise programme. An intervention is expected to be more efficacious in encouraging physical activity than the usual care if it includes ''Prompts and cues'' to walk or exercise, like a phone call or a text message. It is extremely helpful if a trusted clinician provides explicit advice to engage in physical activity (''Credible source''). Another highly effective strategy is to place objects that will serve as a cue to engage in physical activity in the everyday environment of the patient (''Adding object to the environment''; e.g., exercise step or treadmill). Encouragement to walk or exercise in various settings beyond CR (e.g., home, neighbourhood, parks) is also promising (''Generalisation of target behaviour''). Additional promising strategies are ''Graded tasks'' (e.g., gradual increase in intensity and duration of exercise training), ''Self-monitoring'', ''Monitoring of physical activity by others without feedback'', ''Action planning'', and ''Goal-setting''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amirova A, Fteropoulli T, Williams P, Haddad M | title = Efficacy of interventions to increase physical activity for people with heart failure: a meta-analysis | journal = Open Heart | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e001687 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 34108272 | pmc = 8191629 | doi = 10.1136/openhrt-2021-001687 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve [[quality of life]] and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms, but no evidence shows a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise.

=====Other medications=====
Second-line medications for CHF do not confer a mortality benefit. [[Digoxin]] is one such medication.

====Implanted devices====
In people with severe cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%), or in those with recurrent VT or malignant arrhythmias, treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is indicated to reduce the risk of severe life-threatening arrhythmias. The AICD does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias, often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications. In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of [[ventricular tachycardia]] or [[sudden cardiac death]] is high enough to warrant AICD placement. Its use is therefore recommended in [[American Hospital Association|AHA]]/[[American College of Cardiology|ACC]] guidelines.<ref name="Guidelines rhythm-abnormalities" />

[[Cardiac contractility modulation]] (CCM) is a [[Therapy|treatment]] for people with moderate to severe [[Heart#Chambers|left ventricular]] systolic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV), which enhances both the strength of ventricular [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] and the heart's pumping capacity.

About one-third of people with [[LVEF]] below 35% have markedly altered conduction to the ventricles, resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of the right and left ventricles. This is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block (blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originate at the base of the heart and carry depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle). Using a special pacing algorithm, biventricular [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]] (CRT) can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization. In people with LVEF below 35% and prolonged QRS duration on ECG (LBBB or QRS of 150 ms or more), an improvement in symptoms and mortality occurs when CRT is added to standard medical therapy.<ref name=ACCFAHA2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yancy CW, Jessup M, Bozkurt B, Butler J, Casey DE, Drazner MH, Fonarow GC, Geraci SA, Horwich T, Januzzi JL, Johnson MR, Kasper EK, Levy WC, Masoudi FA, McBride PE, McMurray JJ, Mitchell JE, Peterson PN, Riegel B, Sam F, Stevenson LW, Tang WH, Tsai EJ, Wilkoff BL | display-authors = 6 | title = 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines | journal = Circulation | volume = 128 | issue = 16 | pages = e240–327 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23741058 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e31829e8776 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, in the two-thirds of people without prolonged QRS duration, CRT may actually be harmful.<ref name="Guidelines rhythm-abnormalities" /><ref name="Kuck 2013" /><ref name="Ruschitzka 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruschitzka F, Abraham WT, Singh JP, Bax JJ, Borer JS, Brugada J, Dickstein K, Ford I, Gorcsan J, Gras D, Krum H, Sogaard P, Holzmeister J | display-authors = 6 | title = Cardiac-resynchronization therapy in heart failure with a narrow QRS complex | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1395–405 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23998714 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1306687 | s2cid = 205095941 | url = https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/84125/1/Ruschitzka_NEJMechoCRT.pdf | access-date = 24 November 2018 | archive-date = 28 July 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200728222046/https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/84125/1/Ruschitzka_NEJMechoCRT.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>

====Surgical therapies====
People with the most severe heart failure may be candidates for [[ventricular assist device]]s, which have commonly been used as a bridge to heart transplantation, but have been used more recently as a destination treatment for advanced heart failure.<ref name="Carrel 2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrel T, Englberger L, Martinelli MV, Takala J, Boesch C, Sigurdadottir V, Gygax E, Kadner A, Mohacsi P | title = Continuous flow left ventricular assist devices: a valid option for heart failure patients | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 142 | pages = w13701 | date = Oct 18, 2012 | pmid = 23135811 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2012.13701 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In select cases, heart transplantation can be considered. While this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure, the person must generally remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, which has its own significant downsides.<ref name="Lindenfeld 2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindenfeld J, Miller GG, Shakar SF, Zolty R, Lowes BD, Wolfel EE, Mestroni L, Page RL, Kobashigawa J | display-authors = 6 | title = Drug therapy in the heart transplant recipient: part I: cardiac rejection and immunosuppressive drugs | journal = Circulation | volume = 110 | issue = 24 | pages = 3734–40 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15596559 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.0000149745.83186.89 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A major limitation of this treatment option is the scarcity of hearts available for transplantation.

Without transplantation, heart failure may not be reversible and heart function typically deteriorates with time. The growing number of people with stage IV heart failure (intractable symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy) should be considered for palliative care or [[hospice]], according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.<ref name=AHAJournPallaiative/>

==Prognosis==
Prognosis in heart failure can be assessed in multiple ways, including clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Clinical prediction rules use a composite of clinical factors such as laboratory tests and blood pressure to estimate prognosis. Among several [[clinical prediction rule]]s for prognosticating acute heart failure, the 'EFFECT rule' slightly outperformed other rules in stratifying people and identifying those at low risk of death during hospitalization or within 30 days.<ref name="pmid17449141">{{cite journal | vauthors = Auble TE, Hsieh M, McCausland JB, Yealy DM | title = Comparison of four clinical prediction rules for estimating risk in heart failure | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–35, 135.e1–2 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17449141 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.02.017 }}</ref> Easy methods for identifying people that are low-risk are:
* ADHERE Tree rule indicates that people with [[blood urea nitrogen]] < 43&nbsp;mg/dL and [[systolic blood pressure]] at least 115&nbsp;mm Hg have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.
* BWH rule indicates that people with systolic blood pressure over 90&nbsp;mm Hg, respiratory rate of 30 or fewer breaths per minute, serum sodium over 135&nbsp;mmol/L, and no new ST–T wave changes have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.

A very important method for assessing prognosis in people with advanced heart failure is cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX testing). CPX testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. CPX testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption ([[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub> max]]) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO<sub>2</sub> max less than 12–14 cc/kg/min indicates poor survival and suggests that the person may be a candidate for a heart transplant. People with a VO<sub>2</sub> max <10 cc/kg/min have a clearly poorer prognosis. The most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehra MR, Kobashigawa J, Starling R, Russell S, Uber PA, Parameshwar J, Mohacsi P, Augustine S, Aaronson K, Barr M | display-authors = 6 | title = Listing criteria for heart transplantation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates – 2006 | journal = The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1024–42 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16962464 | doi = 10.1016/j.healun.2006.06.008 }}</ref> also suggest two other parameters that can be used for evaluation of prognosis in advanced heart failure, the heart failure survival score and the use of a criterion of VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope > 35 from the CPX test. The heart failure survival score is calculated using a combination of clinical predictors and the VO<sub>2</sub> max from the CPX test.

==History==

For centuries, the disease entity which would include many cases of what today would be called heart failure was ''dropsy''; the term denotes generalized edema, a major manifestation of a failing heart, though also caused by other diseases. Writings of ancient civilizations include evidence of their acquaintance with dropsy and heart failure: Egyptians were the first to use [[bloodletting]] to relieve fluid accumulation and shortage of breath, and provided what may have been the first documented observations on heart failure in the Ebers papurus (around 1500 BCE);<ref name="pmid16911907">{{cite journal | vauthors=Saba MM, Ventura HO, Saleh M, Mehra MR | title=Ancient Egyptian medicine and the concept of heart failure. | journal=J Card Fail | year=2006 | volume=12 | issue=6 | pages=416–21 | pmid=16911907 | doi=10.1016/j.cardfail.2006.03.001 | pmc= | url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16911907 | access-date=13 March 2021 | archive-date=9 August 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230809061730/https://www.onlinejcf.com/article/S1071-9164(06)00135-7/fulltext | url-status=live }}</ref> Greeks described cases of dyspnea, fluid retention and fatigue compatible with heart failure;<ref name="pmid8502981">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nolan J | title = A historical review of heart failure | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 53–7 | date = April 1993 | pmid = 8502981 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1177/003693309303800208 | s2cid = 5216806 }}</ref> Romans used the flowering plant ''[[Drimia maritima]]'' (sea squill), which contains [[cardiac glycoside]]s, for the treatment of dropsy;<ref name="pmid15685783">{{cite journal | vauthors = Norn S, Kruse PR | title = [Cardiac glycosides: From ancient history through Withering's foxglove to endogeneous cardiac glycosides] | journal = Dansk Medicinhistorisk Arbog | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 119–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15685783 | pmc =  | doi =  }}</ref> descriptions pertaining to heart failure are also known in the civilizations of ancient India and China.<ref name="pmid31620262">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajar R | title = Congestive Heart Failure: A History | journal = Heart Views | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 129–132 | year = 2019 | pmid = 31620262 | pmc = 6791096 | doi = 10.4103/HEARTVIEWS.HEARTVIEWS_77_19 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, the manifestations of failing heart were understood in the context of these peoples' medical theories – including ancient Egyptian religion, [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[theory of Humours|theory of humours]], or ancient [[Ayurveda#History|Indian]] and [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]], and the current concept of heart failure had not developed yet.<ref name="pmid8502981"/><ref name="pmid31620262"/> Although shortage of breath had been connected to heart disease by [[Avicenna]] round 1000 CE,<ref name="pmid31980269">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bestetti RB, Cardinalli-Neto A, Couto LB | title = The history of the evolution of the knowledge about the diagnosis and the pathogenetic aspects of heart failure: From the Egyptians to James Mackenzie | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 304 | issue =  | pages = 109–115 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 31980269 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.12.050 | s2cid = 210890303 }}</ref> decisive for modern understanding of the nature of the condition were the description of [[pulmonary circulation]] by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century, and of [[circulatory system|systemic circulation]] by [[William Harvey]] in 1628.<ref name="pmid8502981"/> The role of the heart in fluid retention began to be better appreciated, as ''dropsy of the chest'' (fluid accumulation in and round the lungs causing shortage of breath) became more familiar and the current concept of heart failure, which brings together swelling and shortage of breath due to fluid retention, began to be accepted, in the 17th and especially in the 18th century: [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]] linked dyspnea and foot swelling in 1679, and [[Giovanni Maria Lancisi]] connected jugular vein distention with right ventricular failure in 1728.<ref name="pmid31980269"/> Dropsy attributable to other causes, e.g. kidney failure, was differentiated in the 19th century.<ref name="pmid4896254">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarcho S | title = An Eighteenth Century treatise on dropsy of the chest (Buchner, 1742) | journal = Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine | volume = 45 | issue = 8 | pages = 799–806 | date = August 1969 | pmid = 4896254 | pmc = 1750442 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid9185118">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eknoyan G | title = A history of edema and its management | journal =   Kidney International.

In 2011, nonhypertensive heart failure was one of the 10 most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S., with aggregate inpatient hospital costs more than $10.5 billion.<ref>Torio CM, Andrews RM.
