The '''metaphysis''' ({{plural form}}: '''metaphyses''') is the neck portion of a [[long bone]] between the [[epiphysis]] and the [[diaphysis]].<ref>Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary, 27th edition</ref> It contains the [[growth plate]], the part of the bone that grows during childhood, and as it grows it [[ossifies]] near the diaphysis and the epiphyses. The metaphysis contains a diverse population of cells including [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal stem cells]], which give rise to [[Osteoblast|bone]] and [[Adipocyte|fat]] cells, as well as [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic stem cells]] which give rise to a variety of [[Blood cell|blood cells]] as well as bone-destroying cells called [[Osteoclast|osteoclasts]]. Thus the metaphysis contains a highly metabolic set of tissues including [[Spongy bone|trabecular (spongy) bone]], [[Blood vessel|blood vessels]] , as well as [[Marrow adipose tissue|Marrow Adipose Tissue (MAT)]]. 

The metaphysis may be divided anatomically into three components based on tissue content: a [[cartilaginous]] component ([[epiphyseal plate]]), a bony component (metaphysis) and a [[Fibrous joint|fibrous]] component surrounding the periphery of the plate. The growth plate synchronizes [[chondrogenesis]] with [[osteogenesis]] or interstitial cartilage growth with both appositional bone elongation in conjunction with growth in width, so bearing load and responding to local and systemic forces and factors balance one another mechanically.

During childhood, the growth plate contains the connecting cartilage enabling the bone to grow; at adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 25 years), the components of the growth plate stop growing altogether and completely ossify into solid bone.<ref>Visual dictionary of Merriam-Webster

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Lead PoisoningRadio.jpg|thumb|An X ray demonstrating the characteristic finding of [[lead poisoning]] in humans—dense metaphyseal lines.]]

Because of their rich blood supply and vascular stasis, metaphyses of long bones are prone to hematogenous spread of [[osteomyelitis]] in children.<ref name=Luqmani>{{cite book|last1=Luqmani|first1=Raashid|last2=Robb|first2=James|last3=Daniel|first3=Porter|last4=Benjamin|first4=Joseph|title=Orthopaedics, Trauma and Rheumatology|date=2013|publisher=Mosby|isbn=9780723436805|page=96|edition=second}}</ref>

Metaphyseal tumors or lesions include [[osteosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], [[osteoblastoma]], [[enchondroma]], [[fibrous dysplasia]], [[simple bone cyst]], [[aneurysmal bone cyst]], [[non-ossifying fibroma]], and [[osteoid osteoma]].<ref name="urlInroductory Course">{{cite web|url=http://www.umdnj.edu/tutorweb/introductory.htm |title=New Jersey Medical School, Pathology Department Introductory Course on Bone Tumours |access-date=2009-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306185754/http://www.umdnj.edu/tutorweb/introductory.htm |archive-date=2009-03-06 }}</ref>

One of the clinical signs of [[rickets]] that doctors look for is cupping and fraying at the metaphyses when seen on [[X-ray]].
