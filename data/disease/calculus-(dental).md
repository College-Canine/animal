In [[dentistry]], '''calculus''' or '''tartar''' is a form of hardened [[dental plaque]]. It is caused by precipitation of minerals from [[saliva]] and [[Gingival sulcus|gingival crevicular fluid]] (GCF) in plaque on the [[teeth]]. This process of precipitation kills the bacterial cells within dental plaque, but the rough and hardened surface that is formed provides an ideal surface for further plaque formation. This leads to calculus buildup, which compromises the health of the [[gingiva]] (gums). Calculus can form both along the gumline, where it is referred to as supragingival ("above the gum"), and within the narrow [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]] that exists between the teeth and the gingiva, where it is referred to as subgingival ("below the gum").

Calculus formation is associated with a number of clinical manifestations, including [[halitosis|bad breath]], [[receding gums]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]ally inflamed gingiva. Brushing and flossing can remove plaque from which calculus forms; however, once formed, calculus is too hard (firmly attached) to be removed with a toothbrush. Calculus buildup can be removed with ultrasonic tools or dental hand instruments (such as a [[periodontal scaler]]).

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin ''calculus'' "small stone", from ''calx'' "limestone, lime",<ref>{{L&S|calx2|calx|ref}}</ref> probably related to Greek {{lang|grc|χάλιξ}} ''chalix'' "small stone, pebble, rubble",<ref>{{LSJ|xa/lic|χάλιξ|ref}}.</ref> which many{{who|date=August 2021}} trace to a Proto-Indo-European root for "split, break up".<ref name="OETYMD">{{OEtymD|calculus}} {{OEtymD|chalk}}</ref> ''Calculus'' was a term used for various kinds of stones. This spun off many modern words, including "calculate" (use stones for mathematical purposes), and "calculus", which came to be used, in the 18th century, for accidental or incidental mineral buildups in human and animal bodies, like kidney stones and minerals on teeth.<ref name="OETYMD"/>

Tartar, on the other hand, originates in Greek as well (''tartaron''), but as the term for the white encrustation inside casks (a.k.a. [[potassium bitartrate]], commonly known as [[potassium bitartrate|cream of tartar]]). This came to be a term used for [[calcium phosphate]] on teeth in the early 19th century.<ref>{{OEtymD|tartar}}</ref>

==Chemical composition==
Calculus is composed of both inorganic (mineral) and organic (cellular and extracellular matrix) components. 

===In supra-gingival calculus===

===In sub-gingival calculus===
Sub-gingival calculus is composed almost entirely of two components: fossilized anaerobic bacteria whose biological composition has been replaced by [[calcium phosphate]] salts, and calcium phosphate salts that have joined the fossilized bacteria in calculus formations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Hubert E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eZpAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sub-gingival+calculus%22+%22fossilized+anaerobic+bacteria%22+%22calcium+phosphate+salts%22 |title=Formation and Inhibition of Dental Calculus |date=1969 |publisher=Hans Huber |isbn=978-3-456-00235-4 |language=en}}</ref>

==Calculus formation==
Dental calculus typically forms in incremental layers<ref>{{cite book | title = Formation and Inhibition of Dental Calculus | author = Schroeder HE | journal = Journal of Periodontology | publisher = Hans Huber Publishers | year = 1969 | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 643–646 | doi = 10.1902/jop.1969.40.11.643 | pmid = 5260623 | isbn = 9783456002354}}</ref> that are easily visible using both [[electron microscopy]] and [[light microscopy]].<ref name="auto2"/> These layers form during periodic calcification events of the dental plaque,<ref name="auto3"/> but the timing and triggers of these events are not well understood.  The formation of calculus varies widely among individuals and at different locations within the mouth. Many variables have been identified that influence the formation of dental calculus, including age, gender, ethnic background, diet, location in the oral cavity, oral hygiene, bacterial plaque composition, host genetics, access to professional dental care, physical disabilities, systemic diseases, tobacco use, and drugs and medications.<ref name="auto3"/>

Supragingival calculus formation is most abundant on the buccal (cheek) surfaces of the [[maxilla|maxillary (upper jaw)]] [[molars]] and on the lingual (tongue) surfaces of the [[mandibular]] (lower jaw) [[incisors]].<ref name="auto3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jepsen S, Deschner J, Braun A, Schwarz F, Eberhard J | title = Calculus removal and the prevention of its formation | journal = Periodontology 2000 | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–88 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21134234 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0757.2010.00382.x }}</ref> These areas experience high salivary flow because of their proximity to the parotid and sublingual [[salivary glands]]. 

Subgingival calculus forms below the gumline and is typically darkened in color by the presence of black-pigmented bacteria,<ref name="auto3"/> whose cells are coated in a layer of iron obtained from heme during gingival bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soukos NS, Som S, Abernethy AD, Ruggiero K, Dunham J, Lee C, Doukas AG, Goodson JM | title = Phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 1391–6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15793117 | pmc = 1068628 | doi = 10.1128/aac.49.4.1391-1396.2005 }}</ref> The reason fossilized bacteria are initially attracted to one part of the subgingival tooth surface over another is not fully understood. However, once the first layer is attached, more calculus components are naturally attracted to the same places due to electrical charge. This is because the calcium phosphate salts contained in them exist as electrically unstable ions (unlike calcium phosphate, the primary component of teeth). The fossilized bacteria pile up rather haphazardly, while free-floating ionic components (calcium phosphate salts) fill in the gaps.<ref name=":0" />

The resultant hardened structure can be compared to concrete; with the fossilized bacteria playing the role of aggregate, and the smaller calcium phosphate salts being the cement.  The "hardened" calculus formations are at the heart of periodontal disease and treatment.<ref name=":0" />

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Plaque accumulation.jpg|thumb|279x279px|Retentive surface of calculus allows for further plaque accumulation.]]
[[dental plaque|Plaque]] accumulation causes the [[gingiva]] to become irritated and inflamed, and this is referred to as [[gingivitis]].  When the gingiva become so irritated that there is a loss of the [[connective tissue]] [[gingival fibers|fibers]] that attach the gums to the teeth and bone that surrounds the tooth, this is known as [[periodontitis]].  Dental plaque is not the sole cause of periodontitis; however it is many times referred to as a primary [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]].  Plaque that remains in the oral cavity long enough will eventually calcify and become calculus.<ref name="auto3"/>  Calculus is detrimental to gingival health because it serves as a trap for increased plaque formation and retention; thus, calculus, along with other factors that cause a localized build-up of plaque, is referred to as a secondary aetiology of periodontitis.

When plaque is supragingival, the bacterial content contains a great proportion of [[aerobic bacteria]] and [[yeast]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clayton YM, Fox EC | title = Investigations into the mycology of dental calculus in town-dwellers, agricultural workers and grazing animals | journal = Journal of Periodontology | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–5 | date = May 1973 | pmid = 4572515 | doi = 10.1902/jop.1973.44.5.281 }}</ref> or those bacteria which utilize and can survive in an environment containing [[oxygen]].

Hand instruments are specially designed tools used by dental professionals to remove plaque and calculus deposits that have formed on the teeth.<ref name="Newman_2011" /><ref name="Darby_2009" /> These tools include scalers, curettes, jaquettes, hoes, files and chisels.<ref name="Newman_2011" /><ref name="Darby_2009" /> Each type of tool is designed to be used in specific areas of the mouth.<ref name="Darby_2009" /> Some commonly used instruments include sickle scalers which are designed with a pointed tip and are mainly used supragingivally.<ref name="Newman_2011" /><ref name="Darby_2009" /> Curettes are mainly used to remove subgingival calculus, smooth root surfaces and to clean out periodontal pockets.<ref name="Newman_2011" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamath DG, Umesh Nayak S | title = Detection, removal and prevention of calculus: Literature Review | journal = The Saudi Dental Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–13 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24526823 | pmc = 3923169 | doi = 10.1016/j.sdentj.2013.12.003 }}</ref> Curettes can be divided into two subgroups: universals and area specific instruments. Universal curettes can be used in multiple areas, while area specific instruments are designed for select tooth surfaces.<ref name="Darby_2009" /> Gracey curettes are a popular type of area specific curettes.<ref name="Darby_2009" /> Due to their design, area specific curettes allow for better adaptation to the root surface and can be slightly more effective than universals.<ref name="Newman_2011" /><ref name="Darby_2009" /> Hoes, chisels, and files are less widely used than scalers and curettes. These are beneficial when removing large amounts of calculus or tenacious calculus that cannot be removed with a curette or scaler alone.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> Chisels and hoes are used to remove bands of calculus, whereas files are used to crush burnished or tenacious calculus.<ref name="Newman_2011" />

Ultrasonic scalers, also known as power scalers, are effective in removing calculus, stain, and plaque. These scalers are also useful for root planing, curettage, and surgical debridement.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> Not only is tenacious calculus and stain removed more effectively with ultrasonic scalers than with hand instrumentation alone, it is evident that the most satisfactory clinical results are when ultrasonics are used in adjunct to hand instrumentation.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> There are two types of ultrasonic scalers; piezoelectric and magnetostrictive. Oscillating material in both of these handpieces cause the tip of the scaler to vibrate at high speeds, between 18,000 and 50,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> The tip of each scaler uses a different vibration pattern for removal of calculus.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> The magnetostrictive power scaler vibration is elliptical, activating all sides of the tip, whereas the piezoelectric vibration is linear and is more active on the two sides of the tip.<ref name="Newman_2011" />

Special tips for ultrasonic scalers are designed to address different areas of the mouth and varying amounts of calculus buildup. Larger tips are used for heavy subgingival or supragingival calculus deposits, whereas thinner tips are designed more for definitive subgingival debridement.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> As the high frequency vibrations loosen calculus and plaque, heat is generated at the tip.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> A water spray is directed towards the end of the tip to cool it as well as irrigate the gingiva during debridement.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> Only the first 1–2&nbsp;mm of the tip on the ultrasonic scaler is most effective for removal, and therefore needs to come into direct contact with the calculus to fracture the deposits.<ref name="Newman_2011" /> Small adaptations are needed in order to keep the tip of the scaler touching the surface of the tooth, while overlapping oblique, horizontal, or vertical strokes are used for adequate calculus removal.<ref name="Newman_2011" />

Current research on potentially more effective methods of subgingival calculus removal focuses on the use of near-ultraviolet and near-infrared lasers, such as [[Dental laser|Er,Cr:YSGG lasers]].<ref name="Schoenly_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoenly JE, Seka WD, Rechmann P | title = Near-ultraviolet removal rates for subgingival dental calculus at different irradiation angles | journal = Journal of Biomedical Optics | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 071404–071404–7 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21806250 | doi = 10.1117/1.3564907 | bibcode = 2011JBO....16g1404S | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Ting_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ting CC, Fukuda M, Watanabe T, Aoki T, Sanaoka A, Noguchi T | title = Effects of Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation on the root surface: morphologic analysis and efficiency of calculus removal | journal = Journal of Periodontology | volume = 78 | issue = 11 | pages = 2156–64 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17970683 | doi = 10.1902/jop.2007.070160 }}</ref> The use of lasers in periodontal therapy offers a unique clinical advantage over conventional hand instrumentation, as the thin and flexible fibers can deliver laser energy into periodontal pockets that are otherwise difficult to access.<ref name="Ting_2007" /> Near-infrared lasers, such as the Er,CR:YSGG laser, have been proposed as an effective adjunct for calculus removal as the emission wavelength is highly absorbed by water, a large component of calculus deposits.<ref name="Ting_2007" /> An optimal output power setting of 1.0-W with the near-infrared Er,Cr:YSGG laser has been shown to be effective for root scaling.<ref name="Ting_2007" /> Near-ultraviolet lasers have also shown promise as they allow the dental professional to remove calculus deposits quickly, without removing underlying healthy tooth structure, which often occurs during hand instrumentation.<ref name="Schoenly_2011" /> Additionally, near-ultraviolet lasers are effective at various irradiation angles for calculus removal.<ref name="Schoenly_2011" /> Discrepancies in the efficiency of removal are due to the physical and optical properties of the calculus deposits, not to the angle of laser use.<ref name="Schoenly_2011" /> Dental hygienists must receive additional theoretical and clinical training on the use of lasers, where legislation permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crdha.ca/legislation/hpa-frequently-asked-questions.aspx|publisher=CRDHA|title=HPA Frequently Asked Questions|access-date=2016-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220190613/http://www.crdha.ca/legislation/hpa-frequently-asked-questions.aspx|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
