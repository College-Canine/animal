The '''Bull Terrier''' is a [[dog breed|breed of dog]] in the [[terrier]] family. There is also a miniature version of this breed which is officially known as the [[Miniature Bull Terrier]]. This breed originates in 19th century [[England]]. Originally bred for vermin control and bloodsports, this breed can be independent and stubborn.

==Appearance==
[[File:bullterrier.jpg|thumb|left|A brindle Bull Terrier showing head profile, triangular eyes, robust and very muscular body]]
The Bull Terrier's most recognizable feature is its head, described as 'egg-shaped', when viewed from the front; the top of the skull and face is almost flat. The profile curves gently downwards from the top of the skull to the tip of the nose, which is black and bent downwards at the tip, with well-developed nostrils. The lower jaw is deep and strong. The unique, triangular eyes are small, dark, and deep-set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/dogsofallnations00masorich|title=Dogs of all nations|first=Walter Esplin|last=Mason|date=14 August 1915|publisher=[S.l.: s.n.]|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Bull Terriers are one of the only dogs that have triangular eyes.<ref name="thebullterrierclub.org" /> The body is full and round, with strong, muscular shoulders. The tail is carried horizontally. They are either white, red, fawn, black, brindle, or a combination of these.<ref>[http://www.ckc.ca/en/Default.aspx?tabid=99&BreedCode=BLT CKC Breed Standards], ckc.ca, [https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/027/707/henry.jpg archived] at the [[Wayback Machine]], 20 February 2008.</ref>

Lethal [[acrodermatitis]], also known as Acrodermatitis of the Bull Terrier is a rare [[genodermatosis]] monogenic autosomal inherited disease found exclusively in white Bull Terriers (including the miniature Bull Terrier). The condition is usually fatal and is characterised by poor growth, decreased serum copper and zinc levels, immunodeficiency, [[bronchopneumonia]], skin lesions, and erosions on the [[distal]] extremities. Other symptoms that occur later on include crusting, [[papules]], [[pustules]], [[erythema]], [[hyperkeratosis]], and colour dilution. The condition manifests within the first few weeks of life and most puppies affected die before the age of 2. Their size is roughly half of their unaffected litter mates at a year old. Unlike the human condition [[acrodermatitis enteropathica]], zinc supplements doesn't improve symptoms.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rhodes | first=Karen Helton | last2=Werner | first2=Alexander H. | title=Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | publication-place=Ames, Iowa | date=2011-01-25 | isbn=978-0-8138-1596-1 | page=473-474}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Bauer | first=Anina | last2=Jagannathan | first2=Vidhya | last3=Högler | first3=Sandra | last4=Richter | first4=Barbara | last5=McEwan | first5=Neil A. | last6=Thomas | first6=Anne | last7=Cadieu | first7=Edouard | last8=André | first8=Catherine | last9=Hytönen | first9=Marjo K. | last10=Lohi | first10=Hannes | last11=Welle | first11=Monika M. | last12=Roosje | first12=Petra | last13=Mellersh | first13=Cathryn | last14=Casal | first14=Margret L. | last15=Leeb | first15=Tosso | title=MKLN1 splicing defect in dogs with lethal acrodermatitis | journal=PLOS Genetics | publisher=Public Library of Science (PLoS) | volume=14 | issue=3 | date=2018-03-22 | issn=1553-7404 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007264 | doi-access=free | page=e1007264| pmc=5863938 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Hinksbullterrier.jpg|thumb|[[James Hinks]] Bull terrier]]
[[File:Bull Terrier from 1915.JPG|thumb|A Bull Terrier circa 1915]]
At the start of the 19th century, the "[[bull and terrier]]" breeds were developed to satisfy the needs for [[vermin]] control and animal-based [[blood sport]]s.  The ''bull and terriers'' were based on the [[Old English Bulldog]] (now extinct) and [[Old English Terrier]]s with possible other terriers. This new breed combined the speed and dexterity of lightly built terriers with the dour tenacity of the Bulldog, which was a poor performer in most combat situations, having been bred almost exclusively for fighting bulls and bears tied to a post. Many breeders began to breed bulldogs with terriers, arguing that such a mixture enhances the quality of fighting. Despite the fact that a cross between a bulldog and a terrier was of high value, very little or nothing was done to preserve the breed in its original form. Due to the lack of breed standards—breeding was for performance, not appearance—the "bull and terrier" eventually divided into the ancestors of "Bull Terriers" and "[[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]s", both smaller and easier to handle than the progenitor.<ref name="Canterbury Bull Terrier Club">{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.bullterriersnz.com/info.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121053325/http://www.canterbury.bullterriersnz.com/info.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 November 2008|title=Canterbury Bull Terrier Club|date=21 November 2008}}</ref>

In the mid-19th century, [[James Hinks]] started breeding ''bull and terriers'' with "[[English White Terrier]]s" (now extinct), looking for a cleaner appearance with better legs and nicer head. In 1862, Hinks entered a dam called "Puss" sired by his white Bulldog called "Madman" into the Bull Terrier Class at the dog show held at the [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne Gardens]] in [[Chelsea, London]]. Originally, these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar "egg face", but kept the [[Canine terminology#Stop|stop]] in the skull profile.<ref name="Bull Terrier History">[http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bull-terrier/detail/#history American Kennel Club:Bull Terrier History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805021741/http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bull-terrier/detail/ |date=5 August 2015 }}, akc.org</ref>
The dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], [[Navarran Pointer|Spanish Pointer]], and [[Whippet]] to increase elegance and agility; and [[Borzoi]] and [[Rough Collie]] to reduce the stop. Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognized as "Lord Gladiator", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.<ref name="Canterbury Bull Terrier Club"/><ref>[http://www.ankc.org.au/_uploads/docs/82635Bull_Terrier___Bull_Terrier_(Min)_BSE.pdf ANKC: Extended Breed Standard of The Bull Terrier & Bull Terrier (Miniature)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722005947/http://www.ankc.org.au/_uploads/docs/82635Bull_Terrier___Bull_Terrier_%28Min%29_BSE.pdf |date=22 July 2008 }}, ankc.org.au</ref>

Due to medical problems associated with all-white breeding, Ted Lyon among others began introducing color, using Staffordshire Bull Terriers in the early 20th century. Colored Bull Terriers were recognized as a separate variety (at least by the AKC) in 1936.<ref name="Bull Terrier History" /> [[Brindle]] is the preferred color, but other colors are welcome.<ref name="Bull Terrier History"/><ref>[[Thomas William Hogarth|T.W. Hogarth]] published ''The Coloured and Colour Breeding'', Galashiels: A Walker & Son in 1932, which included chapters – 'Colour Breeding in Bull Terriers' by Major T Grahame and Captain J.N. Ritchie and 'Colour Inheritance in Bull-terriers' by [[Frank Fraser Darling|Dr F Fraser Darling]].</ref>

Along with conformation, specific behavior traits were sought.
