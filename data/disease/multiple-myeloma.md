<!-- Epidemiology -->
Globally, about 175,000 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2020, while about 117,000 people died from the disease that year.  In the U.S., forecasts suggest about 35,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease in 2023, and about 12,000 people will die from the disease that year.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 2023 |title=Multiple Myeloma: Statistics |url=https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/statistics |url-status=live |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=ASCO Cancer.net |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611020418/https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/statistics }}</ref>  In 2020, there were an estimated 170,405 people living with myeloma in the U.S.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |title=Cancer Stat Facts: Myeloma |url=https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html |url-status=live |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=National Cancer Institute |archive-date=7 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507162617/https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/mulmy.html }}</ref>

It is difficult to judge mortality statistics because treatments for the disease are advancing rapidly.  Based on data concerning people diagnosed with the disease between 2013 and 2019, about 60% lived five years or more post-diagnosis, with about 34% living ten years or more.<ref name=":10" />  People newly diagnosed with the disease now have a better outlook, due to improved treatments.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Survival Rates for Multiple Myeloma |url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/multiple-myeloma/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html |url-status=live |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=American Cancer Society |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611020414/https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/multiple-myeloma/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Because many organs can be affected by myeloma, the symptoms and signs vary greatly.  Fatigue and bone pain are the most common symptoms at presentation. The '''CRAB''' criteria were formerly the benchmark used to establish presence of active multiple myeloma (as opposed to an earlier, generally asymptomatic, "smoldering" form of the disease).  The CRAB criteria are:<ref name="IMWG">{{cite journal | vauthors = ((International Myeloma Working Group)) | title = Criteria for the classification of monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma and related disorders: a report of the International Myeloma Working Group | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 749–757 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12780789 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04355.x | s2cid = 3195084 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite book | vauthors = Rajkumar SV |title=ASCO-SEP : Medical Oncology Self-Evaluation Program |publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-9983747-4-1 | veditors = Hensley ML, Milowsky MI, Rajkumar SV, Schuetze SM |edition=7th |location=Alexandria, VA |chapter=Multiple Myeloma |oclc=1080368315 }}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite web |title=International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma |url=https://www.myeloma.org/international-myeloma-working-group-imwg-criteria-diagnosis-multiple-myeloma |url-status=live |access-date=11 June 2023 |website=International Myeloma Foundation |date= 26 October 2014|archive-date=7 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207171830/https://www.myeloma.org/international-myeloma-working-group-imwg-criteria-diagnosis-multiple-myeloma }}</ref>

* '''<u>R</u>enal insufficiency''': creatinine clearance <40 mL per minute or serum creatinine >1.77&nbsp;mol/L (>2&nbsp;mg/dL)
* '''<u>A</u>nemia''': hemoglobin value of >2g/dL below the lowest limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value <10g/dL
* '''<u>B</u>one lesions''': osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET/CT

{{as of|2014}} the diagnostic criteria were expanded and updated by the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) to add three myeloma defining events, any one of which indicates presence of active multiple myeloma. Each of these three events may occur before any of the CRAB criteria appears, thereby making more people eligible for treatment with myeloma drugs earlier.<ref name=":11" />

===Bone pain===
[[File:Blausen 0656 MultipleMyeloma.png|thumb|Illustration showing the most common site of bone lesions in vertebrae]]
Bone pain affects almost 70% of people with multiple myeloma and is one of the most common symptoms.<ref name=":5" />{{Rp|653}}<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Longo D |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th Edition |year=2012 |publisher=Mc Graw Hill Medical |isbn=978-0-07-174889-6 |pages=938}}</ref>  Myeloma bone pain usually involves the spine and ribs, and worsens with activity. Persistent, localized pain may indicate a [[pathological fracture|pathological bone fracture]]. Involvement of the vertebrae may lead to [[spinal cord compression]] or [[kyphosis]]. Myeloma bone disease is due to the overexpression of receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand ([[RANKL]]) by [[bone marrow stroma]]. RANKL activates [[osteoclast]]s, which resorb bone. The resultant bone lesions are lytic (cause breakdown) in nature, and are best seen in plain radiographs, which may show "punched-out" resorptive lesions (including the "raindrop" appearance of the [[skull]] on radiography). The breakdown of bone also leads to the release of [[calcium]] ions into the blood, leading to [[hypercalcemia]] and its associated symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/hypercalcemia/|title= Hypercalcemia|website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library|access-date= 11 August 2021|archive-date= 25 July 2021|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210725153306/https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/hypercalcemia/|url-status= live}}</ref>

===Anemia===
The anemia found in myeloma is usually [[normocytic]] and [[normochromic]]. It results from the replacement of normal bone marrow by infiltrating tumor cells and inhibition of normal red blood cell production ([[hematopoiesis]]) by [[cytokines]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruns I, Cadeddu RP, Brueckmann I, Fröbel J, Geyh S, Büst S, Fischer JC, Roels F, Wilk CM, Schildberg FA, Hünerlitürkoglu AN, Zilkens C, Jäger M, Steidl U, Zohren F, Fenk R, Kobbe G, Brors B, Czibere A, Schroeder T, Trumpp A, Haas R | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiple myeloma-related deregulation of bone marrow-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells | journal = Blood | volume = 120 | issue = 13 | pages = 2620–2630 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22517906 | pmc = 3460684 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2011-04-347484 }}</ref>

===Impaired kidney function===
Impaired [[kidney function]] may develop, either [[acute renal failure|acutely]] or [[chronic renal failure|chronically]], and with any degree of severity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bladé J, Fernández-Llama P, Bosch F, Montolíu J, Lens XM, Montoto S, Cases A, Darnell A, Rozman C, Montserrat E | display-authors = 6 | title = Renal failure in multiple myeloma: presenting features and predictors of outcome in 94 patients from a single institution | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 17 | pages = 1889–1893 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9759684 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.158.17.1889 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Knudsen LM, Hippe E, Hjorth M, Holmberg E, Westin J | title = Renal function in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma--a demographic study of 1353 patients.

The most common cause of kidney failure in multiple myeloma is due to [[protein]]s secreted by the malignant cells.  Myeloma cells produce monoclonal proteins of varying types, most commonly [[antibodies|immunoglobulins (antibodies)]] and [[Serum free light-chain measurement|free light chains]], resulting in abnormally high levels of these proteins in the blood.  Depending on the size of these proteins, they may be excreted through the kidneys.  Kidneys can be damaged by the effects of proteins or light chains. Increased bone resorption leads to hypercalcemia and causes [[nephrocalcinosis]], thereby contributing to kidney failure. [[Amyloidosis]] is a distant third in the causation.  People with amyloidosis have high levels of [[amyloid protein]] that can be excreted through the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs.<ref name="pmid23302715">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nasr SH, Said SM, Valeri AM, Sethi S, Fidler ME, Cornell LD, Gertz MA, Dispenzieri A, Buadi FK, Vrana JA, Theis JD, Dogan A, Leung N | display-authors = 6 | title = The diagnosis and characteristics of renal heavy-chain and heavy/light-chain amyloidosis and their comparison with renal light-chain amyloidosis | journal = Kidney International | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–470 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23302715 | doi = 10.1038/ki.2012.414 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref><ref name="pmid27866585">{{cite journal | vauthors = Castillo JJ | title = Plasma Cell Disorders | journal = Primary Care | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 677–691 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27866585 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2016.07.002 }}</ref>

Light chains produce myriad effects that can manifest as the [[Fanconi syndrome]] ([[Proximal renal tubular acidosis|type II kidney tubular acidosis]]).<ref name="pmid23302715" />

===Infection===
Collateral infections are common with multiple myeloma, since the disease impairs functioning of blood components that normally resist pathogens.  The most common infections are pneumonias, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.<ref name=":16">{{Cite journal |last=Blimark |first=Cecilie |date=January 2015 |title=Multiple myeloma and infections: a population-based study on 9253 multiple myeloma patients |journal=Haematologica |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=107–113 |doi=10.3324/haematol.2014.107714 |pmid=25344526 |pmc=4281323 }}</ref> The greatest risk period for the occurrence of infection is in the initial few months after the start of a new drug therapy, since many drug therapies further suppress the normal immune response.<ref name="pmid8033429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapel HM, Lee M | title = The use of intravenous immune globulin in multiple myeloma | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 97 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 21–24 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 8033429 | pmc = 1550368 }}</ref>

Infections (and "adverse events" for all diseases) are graded by a standardized scale.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web |date=27 November 2017 |title=Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 |url=https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick_reference_8.5x11.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=12 June 2023 |website=U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services |archive-date=19 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230519163350/https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf }}</ref>  With some myeloma drug therapies, over 30% of people experience a "Grade 3" or higher infection (many people experience multiple such infections),<ref name=":14" /> calling for intervention at least by antibiotics.<ref name=":15" />  Of people who die within 6 months of their myeloma diagnosis, between 20% and 50% die from collateral infections.<ref name=":16" />

Clinical evaluation of a person's immune response is typically performed by a lab test that measures the levels of different [[immunoglobulin]]s in the blood.  There are five varieties of immunoglobulins, indicated by the suffices -A, -D, -E, -G and -M.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=Diagnosis of multiple myeloma |url=https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/diagnosis |url-status=live |access-date=11 June 2023 |website=Canadian Cancer Society |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611214500/https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/diagnosis }}</ref>  In the aggregate, the immunoglobulin level may be elevated with the disease, but the majority of such increased antibodies are of a monoclonal variety due to the clonal plasma cell and are thus ineffective.

===Neurological symptoms===
Some symptoms (e.g., [[weakness]], [[confusion]], and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]) may be due to anemia or hypercalcemia. [[Headache]], visual changes, and [[retinopathy]] may be the result of [[hyperviscosity]]  of the blood depending on the properties of the [[paraprotein]]. Finally, [[radicular pain]], loss of [[bowel]] or bladder control (due to involvement of [[spinal cord]] leading to [[Spinal cord compression|cord compression]]) or [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], and other [[neuropathies]] (due to infiltration of [[peripheral nerves]] by [[amyloid]]) may occur. It may give rise to [[paraplegia]] in late-presenting cases.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rudhiram Hematology Clinic—Google Search|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Rudhiram+Hematology+Clinic&ludocid=5150959102409787010&lpsid=CIHM0ogKEICAgIDmnKmfsQE&lsig=AB86z5XrzWBckbIx8_P21jwulFPG|access-date=4 February 2022|website=www.google.com|archive-date=1 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401195831/https://www.google.com/search?q=Rudhiram+Hematology+Clinic&ludocid=5150959102409787010&lpsid=CIHM0ogKEICAgIDmnKmfsQE&lsig=AB86z5XrzWBckbIx8_P21jwulFPG|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Occupations ===
In a study to investigate the association between occupational exposure to aromatic hydrocarbon solvents ([[Benzene]] and its many derivatives), evidence has shown that these solvents have a role in causation of multiple myeloma.<ref name=":02"/> The occurrence of multiple myeloma may occur more in certain occupations.

====Epstein–Barr virus====

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Plasmablast, Wright stain.png|thumb|Plasmablast, [[Wright stain]], in a case of multiple myeloma of plasmablastic type.]]
[[B lymphocytes]] start in the bone marrow and move to the lymph nodes. As they progress, they mature and display different proteins on their cell surfaces (cell surface antigens). When they are activated to secrete antibodies, they are known as plasma cells.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Multiple myeloma develops in B lymphocytes after they have left the part of the lymph node known as the [[germinal center]]. The normal cell type most closely associated with MM cells is generally taken to be either an activated [[memory B cell]] or the precursor to plasma cells, the [[plasmablast]].<ref name="isbn3-8055-6460-0">{{cite book |author1=Federico Caligaris-Cappio |author2=Manlio Ferrarini |title=Human B Cell Populations |series=Chemical Immunology |volume=67 |publisher=S.

The immune system keeps the proliferation of B cells and the secretion of antibodies under tight control. When chromosomes and genes are damaged, often through rearrangement, this control is lost. Often, a promoter gene moves (or translocates) to a chromosome, where it stimulates an antibody gene to overproduction.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

A [[chromosomal translocation]] between the [[immunoglobulin heavy chain]] gene (on [[chromosome 14]], locus q32) and an [[oncogene]] (often 11q13, 4p16.3, 6p21, 16q23 and 20q11<ref name="Kyle">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 18 | pages = 1860–1873 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15509819 | pmc = 2265446 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra041875 }}</ref>) is frequently observed in people with multiple myeloma.

=== Epigenetics ===
In a study that investigated the [[DNA methylation]] profile of multiple myeloma cells and normal [[plasma cell]]s, a gradual demethylation from stem cells to plasma cells was observed. The observed methylation pattern of CpG within intronic regions with enhancer-related chromatin marks in multiple myeloma is similar to undifferentiated precursor and stem cells. These results may represent a ''de novo'' epigenetic reprogramming in multiple myeloma, leading to the acquisition of a methylation pattern related to stemness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agirre X, Castellano G, Pascual M, Heath S, Kulis M, Segura V, Bergmann A, Esteve A, Merkel A, Raineri E, Agueda L, Blanc J, Richardson D, Clarke L, Datta A, Russiñol N, Queirós AC, Beekman R, Rodríguez-Madoz JR, San José-Enériz E, Fang F, Gutiérrez NC, García-Verdugo JM, Robson MI, Schirmer EC, Guruceaga E, Martens JH, Gut M, Calasanz MJ, Flicek P, Siebert R, Campo E, Miguel JF, Melnick A, Stunnenberg HG, Gut IG, Prosper F, Martín-Subero JI | display-authors = 6 | title = Whole-epigenome analysis in multiple myeloma reveals DNA hypermethylation of B cell-specific enhancers | journal = Genome Research | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 478–487 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25644835 | pmc = 4381520 | doi = 10.1101/gr.180240.114 }}</ref> Other studies have identified a multiple myeloma specific gene silencing pattern associated with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalushkova A, Fryknäs M, Lemaire M, Fristedt C, Agarwal P, Eriksson M, Deleu S, Atadja P, Osterborg A, Nilsson K, Vanderkerken K, Oberg F, Jernberg-Wiklund H | display-authors = 6 | title = Polycomb target genes are silenced in multiple myeloma | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = e11483 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20634887 | pmc = 2901331 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011483 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511483K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agarwal P, Alzrigat M, Párraga AA, Enroth S, Singh U, Ungerstedt J, Österborg A, Brown PJ, Ma A, Jin J, Nilsson K, Öberg F, Kalushkova A, Jernberg-Wiklund H | display-authors = 6 | title = Genome-wide profiling of histone H3 lysine 27 and lysine 4 trimethylation in multiple myeloma reveals the importance of Polycomb gene targeting and highlights EZH2 as a potential therapeutic target | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 6809–6823 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26755663 | pmc = 4872750 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.6843 }}</ref> Increased expression of the PRC2 subunit, EZH2 have been described to be a common feature in multiple myeloma, resulting in an accumulation and redistribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation which advances with disease severity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Croonquist PA, Van Ness B | title = The polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH 2) is an oncogene that influences myeloma cell growth and the mutant ras phenotype | journal = Oncogene | volume = 24 | issue = 41 | pages = 6269–6280 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16007202 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1208771 | s2cid = 24588617 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

=== Development ===
The genetic and epigenetic changes occur progressively. The initial change, often involving one chromosome 14 translocation, establishes a clone of bone marrow plasma cells that causes the asymptomatic disorder [[Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance|MGUS]], which is a [[premalignant]] disorder characterized by increased numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow or the circulation of a myeloma protein immunoglobulin. Further genetic or epigenic changes produce a new clone of bone marrow plasma cells, usually descendant from the original clone, that causes the more serious, but still asymptomatic premalignant disorder smoldering multiple myeloma. This myeloma is characterized by a rise in the number of bone marrow plasma cells or levels of the circulating myeloma protein above that seen in MGUS.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

Subsequent genetic and epigenetic changes lead to a new, more aggressive clone of plasma cells, which cause further rises in the level of the circulating myeloma protein, further rises in the number of bone marrow plasma cells, or the development of one or more of a specific set of "CRAB" symptoms, which are the basis for diagnosing malignant multiple myeloma and treating the disease.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In a small percentage of multiple myeloma cases, further genetic and epigenetic changes lead to the development of a plasma cell clone that moves from the bone marrow into the [[circulatory system]], invades distant tissues, and thereby causes the most malignant of all plasma cell [[dyscrasia]]s, [[plasma cell leukemia]].<ref name="pmid28466550" /><ref name="pmid23288300">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernández de Larrea C, Kyle RA, Durie BG, Ludwig H, Usmani S, Vesole DH, Hajek R, San Miguel JF, Sezer O, Sonneveld P, Kumar SK, Mahindra A, Comenzo R, Palumbo A, Mazumber A, Anderson KC, Richardson PG, Badros AZ, Caers J, Cavo M, LeLeu X, Dimopoulos MA, Chim CS, Schots R, Noeul A, Fantl D, Mellqvist UH, Landgren O, Chanan-Khan A, Moreau P, Fonseca R, Merlini G, Lahuerta JJ, Bladé J, Orlowski RZ, Shah JJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Plasma cell leukemia: consensus statement on diagnostic requirements, response criteria and treatment recommendations by the International Myeloma Working Group | journal = Leukemia | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 780–791 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23288300 | pmc = 4112539 | doi = 10.1038/leu.2012.336 }}</ref><ref name="pmid26263974">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simeon V, Todoerti K, La Rocca F, Caivano A, Trino S, Lionetti M, Agnelli L, De Luca L, Laurenzana I, Neri A, Musto P | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular Classification and Pharmacogenetics of Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia: An Initial Approach toward Precision Medicine | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 17514–17534 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26263974 | pmc = 4581206 | doi = 10.3390/ijms160817514 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> Thus, a fundamental [[genetic instability]] in plasma cells or their precursors leads to the progression:

<blockquote>
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance → smoldering multiple myeloma → multiple myeloma → plasma cell leukemia
</blockquote>

Being asymptomatic, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma are typically diagnosed fortuitously by detecting a myeloma protein on [[serum protein electrophoresis]] tests done for other purposes. MGUS is a relatively stable condition afflicting 3% of people aged 50 and 5% of people aged 70; it progresses to multiple myeloma at a rate of 0.5–1% cases per year; smoldering multiple myeloma does so at a rate of 10% per year for the first 5 years, but then falls off sharply to 3% per year for the next 5 years and thereafter to 1% per year.<ref name="pmid28466550" /><ref name="pmid28479151" />

Overall, some 2–4% of multiple myeloma cases eventually progress to plasma cell [[leukemia]].<ref name="pmid23288300" />

==Diagnosis==
===Blood tests===
[[File:Monoclonal gammopathy Multiple Myeloma.png|thumb|Serum [[protein electrophoresis|protein electropherogram]] showing a paraprotein (peak in the gamma zone) in a person with multiple myeloma]]

The globulin level may be normal in established disease. A doctor may request [[protein electrophoresis]] of the blood and urine, which might show the presence of a [[paraprotein]] (monoclonal protein, or [[Myeloma protein|M protein]]) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the [[Bence Jones protein]], which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains.  Quantitative measurements of the paraprotein are necessary to establish a diagnosis and to monitor the disease. The paraprotein is an abnormal immunoglobulin produced by the tumor clone.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In theory, multiple myeloma can produce all classes of immunoglobulin, but [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] paraproteins are most common, followed by [[IgA]] and [[IgM]]. [[IgD]] and [[IgE]] myeloma are very rare. In addition, [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light]] and or [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chains]] (the building blocks of antibodies) may be secreted in isolation: κ- or λ-light chains or any of the five types of heavy chains (α-, γ-, δ-, ε- or μ-heavy chains). People without evidence of a monoclonal protein may have "nonsecretory" myeloma (not producing immunoglobulins); this represents about 3% of all people with multiple myeloma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lonial S, Kaufman JL | title = Non-secretory myeloma: a clinician's guide | journal = Oncology | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 924–8, 930 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24282993 | url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/multiple-myeloma/non-secretory-myeloma-clinicians-guide | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180112121913/http://www.cancernetwork.com/multiple-myeloma/non-secretory-myeloma-clinicians-guide | archive-date = 12 January 2018 }}</ref>

Additional findings may include a raised calcium level (when [[osteoclasts]] are breaking down bone, releasing it into the bloodstream), raised serum [[creatinine]] level due to reduced [[renal function|kidney function]], which is mainly due to casts of paraprotein deposition in the kidney, although the cast may also contain complete immunoglobulins, [[Tamm-Horsfall protein]] and [[albumin]].<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book |chapter=Multiple myeloma |author1=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |edition=8th |page=455 |year=2007}}</ref>

Other useful laboratory tests include quantitative measurement of IgA, IgG, and IgM to look for immune paresis, and beta-2 microglobulin, which provides prognostic information.  On peripheral blood smear, the [[rouleaux]] formation of [[red blood cells]] is commonly seen, though this is not specific.

The recent introduction of a commercial immunoassay for measurement of free light chains potentially offers an improvement in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment, particularly where the paraprotein is difficult to measure accurately by [[electrophoresis]] (for example in light chain myeloma, or where the paraprotein level is very low). Initial research also suggests that measurement of free light chains may also be used, in conjunction with other markers, for assessment of the risk of progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajkumar SV | title = MGUS and smoldering multiple myeloma: update on pathogenesis, natural history, and management | journal = Hematology.

A [[bone marrow biopsy]] is usually performed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow occupied by plasma cells. This percentage is used in the [[diagnostic criteria]] for myeloma. [[Immunohistochemistry]] (staining particular cell types using antibodies against surface proteins) can detect plasma cells that express immunoglobulin in the cytoplasm and occasionally on the cell surface; myeloma cells are often [[CD56]], [[CD38]], [[CD138]], and [[CD319]] positive and [[CD19]], [[CD20]], and [[CD45]] negative.<ref name="IMWG" /> [[Flow cytometry]] is often used to establish the clonal nature of the plasma cells, which will generally express only kappa or lambda light chain. [[Cytogenetics]] may also be performed in myeloma for prognostic purposes, including a myeloma-specific [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization]] and [[virtual karyotype]].{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

The plasma cells seen in multiple myeloma have several possible morphologies. First, they could have the appearance of a normal plasma cell, a large cell two or three times the size of a peripheral lymphocyte. Because they are actively producing antibodies, the Golgi apparatus typically produces a light-colored area adjacent to the nucleus, called a perinuclear halo. The single nucleus (with inside a single nucleolus with vesicular nuclear chromatin) is eccentric, displaced by an abundant cytoplasm.
Other common morphologies seen, but which are not usual in normal plasma cells, include:
* Bizarre cells, which are multinucleated
* Mott cells, containing multiple clustered cytoplasmic droplets or other inclusions (sometimes confused with [[Auer rod]]s, commonly seen in myeloid blasts)
* Flame cells, having a fiery red cytoplasm<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/robbins-cotran-pathologic-basis-of-disease-9781455726134.html|title=Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease – 9781455726134 {{!}} US Elsevier Health Bookshop|website=www.us.elsevierhealth.com|access-date=26 October 2016|archive-date=27 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427165613/https://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/robbins-cotran-pathologic-basis-of-disease-9781455726134.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N4rXh_w482MC |title=Robbins and Cotran Atlas of Pathology | vauthors = Klatt EC |date=8 September 2011 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-1-4557-2683-7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910182841/https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N4rXh_w482MC |archive-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>

Historically, the CD138 has been used to isolate myeloma cells for diagnostic purposes. However, this antigen disappears rapidly ''ex vivo''. Recently, however,  the surface antigen [[CD319]] (SLAMF7) was discovered to be considerably more stable and allows robust isolation of malignant plasma cells from delayed or even cryopreserved samples.<ref name="pmid24385542">{{cite journal | vauthors = Frigyesi I, Adolfsson J, Ali M, Christophersen MK, Johnsson E, Turesson I, Gullberg U, Hansson M, Nilsson B | display-authors = 6 | title = Robust isolation of malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma | journal = Blood | volume = 123 | issue = 9 | pages = 1336–1340 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24385542 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2013-09-529800 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

The prognosis varies widely depending upon various risk factors. The Mayo Clinic has developed a risk-stratification model termed Mayo Stratification for Myeloma and Risk-adapted Therapy (mSMART), which divides people into high-risk and standard-risk categories.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mayo Stratification for Myeloma And Risk-adapted Therapy |url=https://nebula.wsimg.com/e1520dd2009dae7c8ea5ca513775b8fa?AccessKeyId=A0994494BBBCBE4A0363&disposition=0&alloworigin=1 |website=nebula.wsimg.com |access-date=29 September 2017 |archive-date=28 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828175914/https://nebula.wsimg.com/e1520dd2009dae7c8ea5ca513775b8fa?AccessKeyId=A0994494BBBCBE4A0363&disposition=0&alloworigin=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> People with deletion of [[chromosome 13]] or hypodiploidy by conventional cytogenetics, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20) or [[Chromosome 17 (human)|17p]]- by molecular genetic studies, or with a high plasma cell labeling index (3% or more) are considered to have high-risk myeloma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonneveld P, Avet-Loiseau H, Lonial S, Usmani S, Siegel D, Anderson KC, Chng WJ, Moreau P, Attal M, Kyle RA, Caers J, Hillengass J, San Miguel J, van de Donk NW, Einsele H, Bladé J, Durie BG, Goldschmidt H, Mateos MV, Palumbo A, Orlowski R | display-authors = 6 | title = Treatment of multiple myeloma with high-risk cytogenetics: a consensus of the International Myeloma Working Group | journal = Blood | volume = 127 | issue = 24 | pages = 2955–2962 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27002115 | pmc = 4920674 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2016-01-631200 }}</ref>

===Medical imaging===
The diagnostic examination of a person with suspected multiple myeloma typically includes a [[skeletal survey]]. This is a series of [[Projectional radiography|X-rays]] of the skull, [[axial skeleton]], and proximal long bones. Myeloma activity sometimes appears as "lytic lesions" (with local disappearance of normal bone due to resorption) or as "punched-out lesions" on the skull X-ray ("raindrop skull"). Lesions may also be [[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerotic]], which is seen as [[radiodense]].<ref name="AngtuacoFassas2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angtuaco EJ, Fassas AB, Walker R, Sethi R, Barlogie B | title = Multiple myeloma: clinical review and diagnostic imaging | journal = Radiology | volume = 231 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–23 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 14990813 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2311020452 }}</ref> Overall, the radiodensity of myeloma is between −30 and 120 [[Hounsfield unit]]s (HU).<ref name="NishidaKimura2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishida Y, Kimura S, Mizobe H, Yamamichi J, Kojima K, Kawaguchi A, Fujisawa M, Matsue K | display-authors = 6 | title = Automatic digital quantification of bone marrow myeloma volume in appendicular skeletons - clinical implications and prognostic significance | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 12885 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29018236 | pmc = 5635114 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-13255-w | bibcode = 2017NatSR...712885N }}</ref> [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is more sensitive than simple X-rays in the detection of lytic lesions, and may supersede a skeletal survey, especially when vertebral disease is suspected.  Occasionally, a [[CT scan]] is performed to measure the size of soft-tissue plasmacytomas. Nuclear Medicine [[Bone scan]]s are typically not of any additional value in the workup of people with myeloma (no new bone formation; lytic lesions not well visualized on nuclear bone scan).

===Diagnostic criteria===
In 2003, the IMG<ref name="IMWG" /> agreed on diagnostic criteria for symptomatic myeloma, asymptomatic myeloma, and MGUS, which was subsequently updated in 2009:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Criteria for diagnosis, staging, risk stratification and response assessment of multiple myeloma | journal = Leukemia | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18971951 | pmc = 2627786 | doi = 10.1038/leu.2008.291 }}</ref>
* Symptomatic myeloma (all three criteria must be met):
*# Clonal plasma cells >10% on bone marrow [[biopsy]] or (in any quantity) in a biopsy from other tissues ([[plasmacytoma]])
*# A [[monoclonal]] protein (myeloma protein) in either serum or urine and it has to be more than 3g/dL (except in cases of true nonsecretory myeloma)
*# Evidence of end-organ damage felt related to the plasma cell disorder (related organ or tissue impairment, CRAB):
*#* [[Hypercalcemia|Hyper'''C'''alcemia]] (corrected calcium >2.75&nbsp;mmol/L, >11&nbsp;mg/dL)
*#* [[Renal failure|'''R'''enal failure]] (kidney insufficiency) attributable to myeloma
*#* [[Anemia|'''A'''nemia]] (hemoglobin <10 g/dL)
*#* '''B'''one [[lesions]] (lytic lesions or osteoporosis with compression fractures)

Note: Recurrent infections alone in a person who has none of the CRAB features is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of myeloma. People who lack CRAB features, but have evidence of amyloidosis, should be considered as amyloidosis and not myeloma. CRAB-like abnormalities are common with numerous diseases, and these abnormalities must be felt to be directly attributable to the related plasma cell disorder and every attempt made to rule out other underlying causes of anemia, kidney failure, etc.

In 2014, the IMWG updated their criteria further to include biomarkers of malignancy.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajkumar SV, Dimopoulos MA, Palumbo A, Blade J, Merlini G, Mateos MV, Kumar S, Hillengass J, Kastritis E, Richardson P, Landgren O, Paiva B, Dispenzieri A, Weiss B, LeLeu X, Zweegman S, Lonial S, Rosinol L, Zamagni E, Jagannath S, Sezer O, Kristinsson SY, Caers J, Usmani SZ, Lahuerta JJ, Johnsen HE, Beksac M, Cavo M, Goldschmidt H, Terpos E, Kyle RA, Anderson KC, Durie BG, Miguel JF | display-authors = 6 | title = International Myeloma Working Group updated criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma | journal = The Lancet.

A person must have >10 % clonal plasma cells and any MDE to be diagnosed with myeloma.<ref name=":1" />  The biomarker criteria were added so that smouldering people with multiple myeloma at high risk of developing multiple myeloma could be diagnosed before organ damage occurred, so they would therefore have a better prognosis.<ref name=":0" />
* Asymptomatic/smoldering myeloma:
*# Serum [[Myeloma protein|M protein]] >30 g/L (3 g/dL) or
*# Clonal plasma cells >10% on bone marrow biopsy and

* Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS):
*# Serum paraprotein <30 g/L (3 g/dL) and
*# Clonal plasma cells <10% on bone marrow biopsy and
*# No myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment or a related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder

Related conditions include solitary [[plasmacytoma]] (a single tumor of plasma cells, typically treated with [[irradiation]]), plasma cell [[dyscrasia]] (where only the antibodies produce symptoms, e.g., [[AL amyloidosis]]), and [[POEMS syndrome|peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes]].

===Staging===
In multiple myeloma, staging helps with prognostication but does not guide treatment decisions. The Durie-Salmon staging system was used historically and was replaced by the International Staging System (ISS), published by the [[International Myeloma Working Group]] In 2005.<ref name="ISS">{{cite journal | vauthors = Greipp PR, San Miguel J, Durie BG, Crowley JJ, Barlogie B, Bladé J, Boccadoro M, Child JA, Avet-Loiseau H, Kyle RA, Lahuerta JJ, Ludwig H, Morgan G, Powles R, Shimizu K, Shustik C, Sonneveld P, Tosi P, Turesson I, Westin J | display-authors = 6 | title = International staging system for multiple myeloma | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 15 | pages = 3412–3420 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15809451 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.242 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> The revised ISS (R-ISS) was published in 2015 and incorporates cytogenetics and [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH).<ref name=":6" />{{Rp|1730–1}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Palumbo A, Avet-Loiseau H, Oliva S, Lokhorst HM, Goldschmidt H, Rosinol L, Richardson P, Caltagirone S, Lahuerta JJ, Facon T, Bringhen S, Gay F, Attal M, Passera R, Spencer A, Offidani M, Kumar S, Musto P, Lonial S, Petrucci MT, Orlowski RZ, Zamagni E, Morgan G, Dimopoulos MA, Durie BG, Anderson KC, Sonneveld P, San Miguel J, Cavo M, Rajkumar SV, Moreau P | display-authors = 6 | title = Revised International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma: A Report From International Myeloma Working Group | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 26 | pages = 2863–2869 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26240224 | pmc = 4846284 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2015.61.2267 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Liedtke M, Fonseca R |title=American Society of Hematology Self-Assessment Program | edition = Seventh |publisher=American Society of Hematology|year=2019|isbn=978-0-9789212-4-8| veditors = Cuker A, Altman J, Gerds A, Wun T |pages=722–69|chapter=Chapter 25: Plasma cell disorders}}</ref>{{Rp|732–3}}

==Prevention==
The risk of multiple myeloma can be reduced slightly by maintaining a normal body weight.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lauby-Secretan B, Scoccianti C, Loomis D, Grosse Y, Bianchini F, Straif K | title = Body Fatness and Cancer--Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 375 | issue = 8 | pages = 794–798 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27557308 | pmc = 6754861 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsr1606602 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Most drug therapies employ multiple agents, e.g., so-called "triplet" or "quadruplet" therapies.  Many such groupings include one or more of a [[monoclonal antibody]] (e.g., [[isatuximab]] or [[daratumumab]]), an immunomodulatory agent (e.g., [[lenalidomide]] or [[pomalidomide]]), and a [[proteasome inhibitor]] (e.g., or [[bortezomib]], [[carfilzomib]] or [[ixazomib]]), in combination with a [[steroid]] (e.g., [[dexamethasone]]).<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last=Rajkumar |first=S.

While triplet therapies were the standard of care for many years, current practice more commonly applies quadruplets of drugs.<ref name=":7" />  Such combination therapies are commonly referenced by initials, employing upper-case letters for drug brandnames and lower-case letters for generic drug names, e.g., VRd for Velcade (brandname for [[bortezomib]]), Revlimid (brandname for [[lenalidomide]]) and dexamethasone.

Commonly, the efficacy of each drug diminishes over time, as the cancer develops drug resistance mechanisms, such as by clonal evolution or genetic mutations.  In part for this reason, multiple myeloma has not historically been treated when in its "smoldering" stage, since the drug(s) utilized may then be of diminished efficacy if the disease progresses to a symptomatic stage.  Thus, the standard of care was "watchful waiting" while the disease smoldered.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Watchful waiting for multiple myeloma |url=https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/treatment/watchful-waiting |url-status=live |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=Canadian Cancer Society |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611012406/https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/multiple-myeloma/treatment/watchful-waiting }}</ref>  Increasingly, however, efforts are underway to study whether drug therapies applied during the smoldering stage might prevent the disease from ever advancing to the active stage.

The first drug in this class approved for multiple myeloma is [[Teclistamab]], but again its use is presently reserved for patients in later stages of the disease.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 October 2022 |title=FDA approves teclistamab-cqyv for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-teclistamab-cqyv-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma |url-status=live |access-date=10 June 2023 |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |archive-date=27 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221027170902/https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-teclistamab-cqyv-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma }}</ref>  Another BITE drug,[[Talquetamab]], is under study; others are in the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chari |first=Ajai |date=15 December 2022 |title=Talquetamab, a T-Cell–Redirecting GPRC5D Bispecific Antibody for Multiple Myeloma |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=387 |issue=24 |pages=2232–2244 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa2204591 |pmid=36507686 |s2cid=254560960 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  (Ongoing clinical trials are investigating BITE therapy for smoldering and newly diagnosed patients.<ref name=":9" />)

Some patients seek out clinical drug trials, as these provide a degree of medical oversight not present in most other clinical settings – not to mention access to new drugs that seem to hold promise over existing therapies.  Some patients temporarily relocate to urban areas where such trials are available.

The major cancer research institutes offer the most clinical trials, but some trials (particularly later-stage, Phase 3, trials) are available at satellite networks that extend to hundreds of hospitals.  The U.S. National Institutes of Health maintains a directory of clinical trials.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Clinical Trials |url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-date=18 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201218140935/https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  In the U.S., cities such as New York, Boston, Houston and Rochester host leading multiple myeloma research efforts; globally, other top-tier myeloma research programs are found at the University of Salamanca, Spain, and at Vrije Universiteit Brussels, amongst others.

Medical information soon becomes outdated in fast-moving medical arenas, such as therapies for multiple myeloma, so oncologists at smaller medical centers may not be able to stay up-to-date with the literature in all relevant disciplines.  This has given rise to organizations that work to educate patients on latest developments in the disease, e.g., by offering webinars featuring prominent researchers and practitioners who focus on multiple myeloma; examples of such organisations are the [[International Myeloma Foundation]] and the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]]. Some patients interested in following latest developments review proceedings from major hematologic cancer conferences, such as the American Society of Hematologists (ASH) Conference,<ref>{{Cite web |title=American Society of Hematology |url=https://www.hematology.org/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603124336/https://www.hematology.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Conference,<ref>{{Cite web |title=American Society of Clinical Oncology |url=https://www.asco.org/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-date=23 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823040333/https://www.asco.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> the IMF IMWG Summit, and the European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Conference.<ref>{{Cite web |title=European Hematology Association |url=https://ehaweb.org/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603222155/https://ehaweb.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Treatment is indicated in myeloma with symptoms.

===Chemotherapy===
====Initial====

The preferred treatment for those under the age of 65 is high-dose chemotherapy, commonly with [[bortezomib]]-based regimens, and [[lenalidomide]]–dexamethasone,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 2962–2972 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18332230 | pmc = 2265446 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-10-078022 }}</ref> to be followed by a stem cell transplant.

The patient is given high-dose chemotherapy, and the patient's stem cells are then transplanted back into the patient. The process is not curative, but does prolong overall survival and complete remission. In allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, a healthy donor's stem cells are transplanted into the affected person. Allogenic stem-cell transplantation has the potential for a cure, but is used in a very small percentage of people (and in the relapsed setting, not as part of initial treatment).<ref name="Kyle" /> Furthermore, a 5–10% treatment-associated mortality rate is associated with allogeneic stem-cell transplant.

People over age 65 and people with significant concurrent illnesses often cannot tolerate stem-cell transplantation.

====Relapse====
Reasons for relapse include disease evolution, either from the selective pressure applied by treatment or by de novo mutations and/or if disease was inadequately represented in the initial biopsy.<ref name=":6" /> Relapse within the first 18 months of diagnosis is considered as functional high-risk multiple myeloma.<ref name=":6" /> Depending on the person's condition, the prior treatment modalities used and the duration of remission, options for relapsed disease include retreatment with the original agent, use of other agents (such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, or dexamethasone, alone or in combination), and a second ASCT.

Later in the course of the disease, it becomes refractory (resistant) to formerly effective treatment.  This stage is referred to as relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Treatment modalities that are commonly use to treat RRMM include dexamethasone, [[proteasome inhibitor]]s (e.g. bortezomib and [[carfilzomib]]), [[immunomodulatory imide drug]]s (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide, and [[pomalidomide]]), and certain [[monoclonal antibodies]] (e.g. [[isatuximab]] against [[CD38]] or antibodies targeting [[CD319]]). Survival expectancy has risen in recent years,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma: Every year a new standard? | journal = Hematological Oncology | volume = 37 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 62–65 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31187526 | pmc = 6570407 | doi = 10.1002/hon.2586 }}</ref> and new treatments are under development.{{medical citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Kidney failure in multiple myeloma can be [[acute renal failure|acute]] (reversible) or [[chronic renal failure|chronic]] (irreversible). Acute kidney failure typically resolves when the calcium and paraprotein levels are brought under control. Treatment of chronic kidney failure is dependent on the type of kidney failure and may involve [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]].

=== Stem cell transplant ===
[[Stem cell transplant]] can be used to treat multiple myeloma.<ref name="NIH2016Pro" /> Stem cell transplants come with a risk of a [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host-disease]]. Mesenchymal stromal cells may reduce the all-cause mortality if they are used for a therapeutic reason and the therapeutic use of MSCs may increase the complete response of acute and chronic GvHD, but the evidence is very uncertain.<ref name=":3" /> The evidence suggests that MSCs for prophylactic reason result in little to no difference in the all-cause mortality, in the relapse of malignant diseases and in the incidence of acute GvHD.<ref name=":3" /> The evidence suggests that MSCs for prophylactic reason reduce the incidence of chronic GvHD.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher SA, Cutler A, Doree C, Brunskill SJ, Stanworth SJ, Navarrete C, Girdlestone J | title = Mesenchymal stromal cells as treatment or prophylaxis for acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with a haematological condition | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD009768 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30697701 | pmc = 6353308 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009768.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group }}</ref>

===Other measures===
In addition to direct treatment of the plasma cell proliferation, [[bisphosphonate]]s (e.g., [[pamidronate]] or [[zoledronic acid]]) are routinely administered to prevent fractures; they have also been observed to have a direct antitumor effect even in people without known skeletal disease.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  If needed, red blood cell transfusions or [[erythropoietin]] can be used for management of anemia.

=== Side effects ===
[[Chemotherapy|Chemotherapies]] and [[stem cell transplant]]s can cause unwanted bleedings and may require platelet transfusions. It was seen that platelet transfusions for people undergoing a chemotherapy or a stem cell transplantation for the prevention of bleeding events had different effects on the number of participants with a bleeding event, the number of days on which a bleeding occurred, the mortality secondary to bleeding and the number of platelet transfusions depending on the way they were used (therapeutic, depending on a threshold, different dose schedules or prophylactic).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Estcourt L, Stanworth S, Doree C, Hopewell S, Murphy MF, Tinmouth A, Heddle N | title = Prophylactic platelet transfusion for prevention of bleeding in patients with haematological disorders after chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD004269 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22592695 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004269.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Estcourt LJ, Stanworth SJ, Doree C, Hopewell S, Trivella M, Murphy MF | title = Comparison of different platelet count thresholds to guide administration of prophylactic platelet transfusion for preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2015 | issue = 11 | pages = CD010983 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26576687 | pmc = 4717525 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010983.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group }}</ref>

=== Supportive treatment ===
Adding physical exercises to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematological malignancies like multiple myeloma may result in little to no difference in the mortality, in the quality of life and in the physical functioning.<ref name=":4" /> These exercises may result in a slight reduction in depression.<ref name=":4" /> Furthermore, aerobic physical exercises probably reduce fatigue. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect and serious adverse events <ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Knips L, Bergenthal N, Streckmann F, Monsef I, Elter T, Skoetz N | title = Aerobic physical exercise for adult patients with haematological malignancies | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD009075 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30702150 | pmc = 6354325 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009075.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group }}</ref>

=== Palliative care ===
Multiple national cancer treatment guidelines recommend early [[palliative care]] for people with advanced multiple myeloma at the time of diagnosis and for anyone who has significant symptoms.<ref>The American Society of Clinical Oncology has made this recommendation based on various cancers.

Palliative care is appropriate at any stage of multiple myeloma and can be provided alongside curative treatment.

=== Teeth ===
Oral prophylaxis, hygiene instruction and elimination of sources of infection within the mouth before beginning cancer treatment, can reduce the risk of infectious complications. Before starting bisphosphonates therapy, the person's dental health should be evaluated to assess the risk factors to prevent the development of [[Medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw|medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw]] (MRONJ). If there are any symptoms or radiographic appearance of MRONJ like jaw pain, loose tooth, mucosal swelling, early referral to an oral surgeon is recommended. Dental extractions should be avoided during the active period of treatment and treat the tooth with nonsurgical root canal treatment instead.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saygin D, Tabib T, Bittar HE, Valenzi E, Sembrat J, Chan SY, Rojas M, Lafyatis R | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcriptional profiling of lung cell populations in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = Pulmonary Circulation | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 383–399 | date = 2 May 2018 | pmid = 32166015 | doi = 10.12968/denu.2018.45.5.383 | pmc = 7052475 }}</ref>

Results of one study found the number of new cases of myeloma to be 9.5 cases per 100,000 African Americans and 4.1 cases per 100,000 Caucasian Americans.<ref name="Brown 1999">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown LM, Linet MS, Greenberg RS, Silverman DT, Hayes RB, Swanson GM, Schwartz AG, Schoenberg JB, Pottern LM, Fraumeni JF | display-authors = 6 | title = Multiple myeloma and family history of cancer among blacks and whites in the U.S | journal = Cancer | volume = 85 | issue = 11 | pages = 2385–2390 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10357409 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990601)85:11<2385::aid-cncr13>3.0.co;2-a | publisher = Wiley | s2cid = 41616510 | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> Among African Americans, myeloma is one of the top-10 causes of cancer death.<ref name="Rosenberg 2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Saygin D, Tabib T, Bittar HE, Valenzi E, Sembrat J, Chan SY, Rojas M, Lafyatis R | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcriptional profiling of lung cell populations in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = Pulmonary Circulation | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1292 | date = 6 December 2014 | pmid = 32166015 | doi = 10.1182/blood.v124.21.1292.1292 | publisher = American Society of Hematology | pmc = 7052475 }}</ref>

===UK===
Myeloma is the 17th-most common cancer in the UK: around 4,800 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011. It is the 16th-most common cause of cancer death: around 2,700 people died of it in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Myeloma statistics |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/Myeloma/ |website=Cancer Research UK |access-date=28 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028121047/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/Myeloma/ |archive-date=28 October 2014}}</ref>

In dogs, multiple myeloma accounts for around 8% of all haemopoietic tumors. Multiple myeloma occurs in older dogs and is not particularly associated with either males or females.  No breeds appear overrepresented in case reviews that have been conducted.<ref name="Matus">{{cite journal | vauthors = Matus RE, Leifer CE, MacEwen EG, Hurvitz AI | title = Prognostic factors for multiple myeloma in the dog | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 188 | issue = 11 | pages = 1288–1292 | date = June 1986 | pmid = 3721983 }}</ref> Diagnosis in dogs is usually delayed due to the initial nonspecificity and range of clinical signs possible. Diagnosis usually involves bone-marrow studies, X-rays, and plasma-protein studies. In dogs, protein studies usually reveal the monoclonal gammaglobulin elevation to be IgA or IgG in equal number of cases.<ref name="Matus" /> In rare cases the globulin elevation is IgM, which is referred to as [[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia]].<ref name="MacEwan">{{cite journal | vauthors = MacEwen EG, Hurvitz AI | title = Diagnosis and management of monoclonal gammopathies | journal = The Veterinary Clinics of North America | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–132 | date = February 1977 | pmid = 403649 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-0279(77)50010-X }}</ref> The prognosis for initial control and return to good quality of life in dogs is good;  43% of dogs started on a combination chemotherapeutic protocol achieved complete remission.  Long-term survival is normal, with a median of 540 days reported.<ref name="Matus" /> The disease eventually recurs, becoming resistant to available therapies.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2023}} The complications of kidney failure, sepsis, or pain can lead to an animal's death, frequently by [[euthanasia]].{{medical citation needed|date=August 2023}}
