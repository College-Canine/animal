'''Miosis''', or '''myosis''' ({{ety|grc|''{{wikt-lang|grc|μύειν}}'' ({{grc-transl|μύειν}})|to close the eyes}}), is excessive [[pupillary response|constriction of the pupil]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miosis Farlex medical dictionary] citing:

[[Anisocoria]] is the condition of one [[pupil]] being more dilated than the other.

==Causes==

=== Age ===
* Senile miosis (a reduction in the size of a person's pupil in old age)

=== Diseases ===
* [[Ehlers Danlos Syndrome]]
* [[Horner's syndrome]]
* [[Hemorrhage]] into [[pons]] ([[intracranial hemorrhage]])
* Hereditary disorders  
* [[Cluster headaches]] with [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]
* [[Iridocyclitis]]
* [[Fatal familial insomnia]]
* [[Aphakia]]

The person also shows [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] of both eyelids and an inattentive look at the camera, a sign of [[altered level of consciousness]] caused by the sedative effect of the drug.]]

=== Drugs ===
* [[Opioid]]s such as [[fentanyl]], [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[methadone]] (the notable exception being [[pethidine]])
* Products containing [[nicotine]] such as cigarettes, [[chewing tobacco]] or gum
* [[Imidazoline]]s such as [[clonidine]], [[naphazoline]], [[oxymetazoline]] and [[tetrahydrozoline]]
* [[Antipsychotics]], including [[risperidone]], [[haloperidol]], [[chlorpromazine]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]]<ref name="Merck_Manual_Amphetamines">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hou RH, Scaife J, Freeman C, Langley RW, Szabadi E, Bradshaw CM | title = Relationship between sedation and pupillary function: comparison of diazepam and diphenhydramine | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 752–60 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16722841 | pmc = 1885114 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02632.x }}</ref>
* [[Cholinergic]] agents such as [[acetylcholine]]  
* [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]
* [[Serotonin antagonist]]s, such as [[ondansetron]] (an anti-emetic) known by its brand name Zofran
* Some cancer [[chemotherapy]] drugs, including [[camptothecin]] derivatives
* [[Mirtazapine]], a [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]] ([[NaSSA]])
* Some [[MAO inhibitor|MAO inhibitors]]
* [[Pilocarpine]] eye drops and all other [[parasympathomimetics]]
* In some rare cases, when exposed to [[mustard gas]]
* [[Organophosphates]]

==Physiology of the photomotor reflex==
Light entering the eye strikes three different [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the [[retina]]: the familiar [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]] used in image forming and the more newly discovered [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s. The ganglion cells give information about ambient light levels, and react sluggishly compared to the rods and cones. Signals from photosensitive ganglion cells have multiple functions including acute suppression of the hormone [[melatonin]], [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the body's [[circadian rhythm]]s and regulation of the size of the pupil.

The retinal photoceptors convert light stimuli into electric impulses. Nerves involved in the resizing of the pupil connect to the [[Pretectum|pretectal nucleus]] of the high [[Mesencephalon|midbrain]], bypassing the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and the primary [[visual cortex]]. From the pretectal nucleus neurons send axons to neurons of the [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]] whose [[Motor neuron|visceromotor]] axons run along both the left and right [[oculomotor nerve]]s. Visceromotor nerve axons (which constitute a portion of [[cranial nerve]] III, along with the somatomotor portion derived from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus) synapse on [[ciliary ganglion]] neurons, whose parasympathetic axons innervate the [[iris sphincter muscle]], producing '''miosis'''.
