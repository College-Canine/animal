<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Rocky Mountain spotted fever''' ('''RMSF''') is a bacterial disease spread by [[ticks]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/index.html |website=CDC |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=en-us |date=15 November 2018}}</ref> It typically begins with a [[fever]] and [[headache]], which is followed a few days later with the development of a [[rash]].<ref name=CDC2018Sym>{{cite web |title=Signs and Symptoms Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html |website=CDC |access-date=19 January 2019 |language=en-us |date=26 October 2018}}</ref> The rash is generally [[Petechial rash|made up of small spots of bleeding]] and starts on the wrists and ankles.<ref name=Koy2018/> Other symptoms may include muscle pains and vomiting.<ref name=CDC2018Sym/> Long-term complications following recovery may include [[hearing loss]] or loss of part of an arm or leg.<ref name=CDC2018Sym/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Spotted fever can be very difficult to diagnose in its early stages, due to the similarity of symptoms with many different diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2019-02-19|title=Signs and symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html|access-date=2021-07-05|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref> People infected with ''R. rickettsii'' usually notice symptoms following an incubation period of one to two weeks after a tick bite. The early clinical presentation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is nonspecific and may resemble a variety of other infectious and noninfectious diseases.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Initial symptoms:<ref>{{cite web |title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=19 February 2019 }}</ref>
* [[Fever]]

The classic triad of findings for this disease are fever, rash, and history of tick bite. However, this combination is often not identified when patients initially present for care. The rash has a [[centripetal]], or "inward" pattern of spread, meaning it begins at the extremities and courses towards the trunk.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/|access-date=2021-07-05|website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Rash===
The rash first appears two to five days after the onset of fever, and it is often quite subtle. Younger patients usually develop the rash earlier than older patients. Most often the rash begins as small, flat, pink, nonitchy spots ([[macules]]) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. These spots turn pale when pressure is applied and eventually become raised on the skin. The characteristic red, spotted ([[petechial rash|petechial]]) rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms, but this type of rash occurs in only 35 to 60% of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The rash involves the palms or soles in as many as 80% of people. However, this distribution may not occur until later on in the course of the disease. As many as 15% of patients may never develop a rash.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Biggs|first=Holly M.|date=2016|title=Diagnosis and Management of Tickborne Rickettsial Diseases: Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Other Spotted Fever Group Rickettsioses, Ehrlichioses, and Anaplasmosis — United States|journal=MMWR.

Ticks are the natural hosts of the disease, serving as both reservoirs and vectors of ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii|R. rickettsii]]''. Ticks transmit the bacteria primarily by their bites. Less commonly, infections may occur following exposure to crushed tick tissues, fluids, or tick feces.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

A female tick can transmit ''R. rickettsii'' to her eggs in a process called [[transovarial transmission]]. Ticks can also become infected with ''R. rickettsii'' while feeding on blood from the host in either the larval or nymphal stage. After the tick develops into the next stage, the ''R. rickettsii'' may be transmitted to the second host during the feeding process. Furthermore, male ticks may transfer ''R. rickettsii'' to female ticks through body fluids or [[spermatozoa]] during the mating process. These types of transmission represent how generations or life stages of infected ticks are maintained.  Once infected, the tick can carry the pathogen for life.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Rickettsiae are transmitted through saliva injected while a tick is feeding. Unlike Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens that require a prolonged attachment period to establish infection, a person can become infected with ''R. rickettsii'' in a feeding time as short as 2 hours.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=4178383 | pmid=25148391 | doi=10.3201/eid2009.140189 | volume=20 | issue=9 | title=Feeding period required by Amblyomma aureolatum ticks for transmission of Rickettsia rickettsii to vertebrate hosts | year=2014 |vauthors=Saraiva DG, Soares HS, Soares JF, Labruna MB | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | pages=1504–10}}</ref> In general, about 1-3% of the tick population carries ''R. rickettsii'', even in areas where the majority of human cases are reported. Therefore, the risk of exposure to a tick carrying ''R. rickettsii'' is low.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The disease is spread by the [[American dog tick]] (''Dermacentor variabilis''), [[Rocky Mountain wood tick]] (''D. andersoni''), [[brown dog tick]] (''Rhipicephalus sanguineus''), and ''[[Amblyomma sculptum]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reassessment of the taxonomic status of Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) with the description of three new species, Amblyomma tonelliae n. sp., Amblyomma interandinum n. sp. and Amblyomma patinoi n. sp., and reinstatement of Amblyomma mixtum Koch, 1844, and Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888 (Ixodida: Ixodidae)|journal=Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases|volume=5|issue=3|pages=252–76|year=2014|pmid=24556273|last1=Nava|first1=S.|last2=Beati|first2=L.|last3=Labruna|first3=M.

The two major vectors of ''R. rickettsii'' in the United States are the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. American dog ticks are widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains and they also occur in limited areas along the Pacific Coast. Dogs and medium-sized mammals are the preferred hosts of an adult American dog tick, although it feeds readily on other large mammals, including [[human being]]s. This tick is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting ''R. rickettsii'' to humans. Rocky Mountain wood ticks (''D. andersoni'') are found in the Rocky Mountain states and in southwestern [[Canada]]. The lifecycle of this tick may require up to three years for its completion. The adult ticks feed primarily on large mammals. The larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Other tick species have been shown to be naturally infected with ''R. rickettsii'' or serve as experimental vectors in the laboratory. These species are likely to play only a minor role in the ecology of ''R. rickettsii''.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==Pathophysiology==

===Entry into host===
''Rickettsia rickettsii'' can be transmitted to human hosts through the bite of an infected tick. As with other bacterium transmitted via ticks, the process generally requires a period of attachment of 4 to 6 hours. However, in some cases a ''Rickettsia rickettsii'' infection has been contracted by contact with tick tissues or fluids.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dantas-Torres|first1=Filipe|title=Rocky Mountain spotted fever|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=7|issue=11|pages=724–732|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(07)70261-x|year=2007|pmc=1607456|pmid=698647|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/2452/238632|type=Submitted manuscript|hdl=2452/113243}}</ref> Then, the bacteria induce their internalization into host cells via a receptor-mediated invasion mechanism.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Researchers believe that this mechanism is similar to that of ''[[Rickettsia conorii]]''. This species of ''Rickettsia'' uses an abundant cell surface protein called OmpB to attach to a host cell membrane protein called Ku70. It has previously been reported that Ku70 migrates to the host cell surface in the presence of "Rickettsia".<ref name="Martinez (9)">{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Yvonne|last2=Cardwell|first2=Marissa|last3=Hermanas|first3=Timothy|last4=Uchiyama|first4=Tsuneo|last5=Martinez|first5=Juan|title=Rickettsial Outer-Membrane Protein B (rOmpB) Mediates Bacterial Invasion through Ku70 in an Actin, c-Cbl, Clathrin and Caveolin 2-Dependent Manner|journal=Cellular Microbiology|date=April 2009|volume=11|issue=4|pages=629–644|doi=10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01279.x|pmid=19134120|pmc=2773465}}</ref> Then, Ku70 is ubiquitinated by c-Cbl, an E3 [[ubiquitin ligase]]. This triggers a cascade of signal transduction events resulting in the recruitment of [[Arp2/3]] complex. [[CDC42]], protein tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Src-family kinases then activate Arp2/3. This causes the alteration of local host cytoskeletal actin at the entry site as part of a zipper mechanism.<ref name="Walker (11)">{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=David|title=Rickettsiae and Rickettsial Infections: The Current State of Knowledge|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2007|volume=45|doi=10.1086/518145|pages=S39–S44|pmid=17582568|doi-access=free}}</ref> Then, the bacteria is phagocytosized by the host cell and enveloped by a [[phagosome]].<ref name="Martinez (9)" />

Studies have suggested that rOmpB is involved in this process of adhesion and invasion. Both rOmpA and rOmpB are members of a family of surface cell antigens (Sca) which are autotransporter proteins; they act as ligands for the Omp proteins and are found throughout the ''rickettsiae''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Noriea|first1=Nicholas|last2=Clark|first2=Tina|last3=Hackstadt|first3=Ted|title=Targeted Knockout of the Rickettsia rickettsii OmpA Surface Antigen Does Not Diminish Virulence in a Mammalian Model System|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1128/mBio.00323-15|pages=e00323–15|pmid=25827414|pmc=4453529|year=2015}}</ref>

===Exit from host cell===
The cytosol of the host cell contains nutrients, [[adenosine triphosphate]], amino acids, and nucleotides which are used by the bacteria for growth. For this reason, as well as to avoid phagolysosomal fusion and death, rickettsiae must escape from the [[phagosome]]. To escape from the phagosome, the bacteria secrete phospholipase D and hemolysin C. This causes disruption of the phagosomal membrane and allows the bacteria to escape. Following generation time in the cytoplasm of the host cells, the bacteria utilizes [[actin]] based [[motility]] to move through the cytosol.<ref name="Martinez (9)" />

RickA, expressed on the rickettsial surface, activates Arp2/3 and causes actin polymerization. The rickettsiae use the actin to propel themselves throughout the cytosol to the surface of the host cell. This causes the host cell membrane to protrude outward and invaginate the membrane of an adjacent cell.<ref name="Walker (11)" /> The bacteria are then taken up by the neighboring cell in a double membrane vacuole that the bacteria can subsequently lyse, enabling spread from cell to cell without exposure to the extracellular environment.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

===Consequences of infection===
''Rickettsia rickettsii'' initially infect blood vessel endothelial cells, but eventually migrate to vital organs such as the brain, skin, and the heart via the blood stream. Bacterial replication in host cells causes endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation, resulting in mononuclear cell infiltration into blood vessels and subsequent red blood cell leakage into surrounding tissues. The characteristic rash observed in Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the direct result of this localized replication of rickettsia in blood vessel endothelial cells.<ref name=Koy2018 />

==Diagnosis==
This disease can be diagnosed by a doctor with and without the use of lab testing.  Lab tests are not always relied upon because treatment may be necessary before the results are returned.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2021-03-26|title=Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of RMSF {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/healthcare-providers/ClinLab-Diagnosis.html|access-date=2021-10-24|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref>

Abnormal laboratory findings seen in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever may include a [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]], [[hyponatremia|low blood sodium concentration]], or elevated [[liver enzyme]] levels. Serology testing and skin biopsy are considered to be the best methods of diagnosis. Although immunofluorescent antibody assays are considered some of the best serology tests available, most antibodies that fight against ''R. rickettsii'' are undetectable on serology tests during the first seven days after infection.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Woods CR|title=Rocky Mountain spotted fever in children|journal=Pediatr Clin North Am|volume=60|issue=2|pages=455–70|date=April 2013|pmid=23481111|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2012.12.001}}</ref>

Differential diagnosis includes [[dengue]], [[leptospirosis]], [[chikungunya]], and [[Zika fever]].<ref name=Al2017/>

==Treatment==
Appropriate [[antibiotic]] treatment should be started immediately when there is a suspicion of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.<ref name=Koy2018 /> Treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of disease as early initiation of treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is associated with lower mortality.<ref name="AAFP Pace">{{cite journal |last1=Pace |first1=EJ |last2=O'Reilly |first2=M |title=Tickborne Diseases: Diagnosis and Management. |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 May 2020 |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=530–540 |pmid=32352736}}</ref> Failure to respond to a [[tetracycline]] argues against a diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Severely ill people may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Preventive therapy in healthy people who have had recent tick bites is not recommended and may only delay the onset of disease.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gammons M, Salam G |title=Tick removal |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=643–5 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12201558 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0815/p643.html}}</ref>

[[Doxycycline]] (a tetracycline) is the drug of choice for patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. According to the CDC,<ref name="cdc">{{cite web |date=2018-10-26 |title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/ |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> "Doctors often avoid prescribing doxycycline to young children because of a warning that tooth staining may occur when used in children less than 8 years old. ..Misperceptions about the use of doxycycline for children prevent kids from getting lifesaving treatment" of rickettsial diseases. "Delay in treatment of rickettsial diseases may lead to severe illness or death. Children are five times more likely than adults to die from RMSF." A 2013 study shows that "short courses of…doxycycline can be used in children without causing tooth staining or weakening of tooth enamel."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=CDC |date=2019-02-19 |title=Research on doxycycline {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/doxycycline/index.html |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us}}</ref> The CDC observed that "clearer language on the drug label may help avoid hesitation in prescribing life-saving doxycycline to children."<ref name=":0" />

Treatment typically consists of 100 milligrams every 12 hours, or for children under {{convert|45|kg|abbr=on}} at 4&nbsp;mg/kg of body weight per day in two divided doses. Treatment should be continued for at least three days after the fever subsides, and until there is unequivocal evidence of clinical improvement. This will be generally for a minimum time of five to ten days.<ref name="Koy2018" /> Severe or complicated outbreaks may require longer treatment courses. [[Chloramphenicol]] is an alternative drug that can be used to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever, specifically in pregnancy. However, this drug may be associated with a wide range of side effects, and careful monitoring of blood levels is required.<ref name="Koy2018" />

==Prognosis==
Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be a very severe illness and patients often require hospitalization. Because ''R. rickettsii'' infects the cells lining [[blood vessel]]s throughout the body, severe manifestations of this disease may involve the [[respiratory system]], [[central nervous system]], [[gastrointestinal system]], or [[kidneys]]. Long-term health problems following acute Rocky Mountain spotted fever infection include partial [[paralysis]] of the lower extremities, [[gangrene]] requiring amputation of fingers, toes, or arms or legs, hearing loss, loss of bowel or bladder control, movement disorders, and language disorders. These complications are most frequent in persons recovering from severe, life-threatening disease, often following lengthy hospitalizations.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Epidemiology==

There are between 500 and 2500 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever reported in the United States per year,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever – Statistics and Epidemiology|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control|access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref> and in only about 20% can the tick be found.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Host factors associated with severe or fatal Rocky Mountain spotted fever include advanced age, male sex, African or Caribbean background, long-term excessive alcohol use and [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) deficiency.

==History==
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (or "black measles" because of its characteristic rash) was recognized in the early 1800s, and in the last 10 years of the 1800s (1890–1900) it became very common, especially in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana. The disease was originally noted to be concentrated on the west-side of the Bitterroot river.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/rocky-mountain-history|title=History of Rocky Mountain Labs (RML) {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> Though it would be decades before scientists discovered the tick as the carrier of the disease, in as early as 1866, Doctor John B. Buker (establishing a practice in Missoula, MT) noticed a tick embedded in the skin of one of his patients.  His notes were later studied as part of later research.<ref>Bleed, Blister and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier by Volney Steele, M.D.{{ISBN|0-87842-505-5}}</ref>

In 1901, Dr. A. F. Longeway was appointed to solve "the black measles problem" in Montana.  He in turn enlisted his friend, Dr. Earl Strain to help him.  Strain suspected that the illness was from ticks.  In 1906, [[Howard T. Ricketts]], a pathologist recruited from the University of Chicago, was the first to establish the identity of the infectious organism (the organism smaller than a bacterium and larger than a virus) that causes this disease. He and others characterized the basic [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] features of the disease, including the role of tick vectors. Their studies found that Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by ''Rickettsia rickettsii'', named in Ricketts's honor.  Ricketts died of [[typhus (disease)|typhus]] (another rickettsial disease) in [[Mexico]] in 1910, shortly after completing his studies on Rocky Mountain spotted fever.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Prior to 1922, Doctors McCray and McClintic both died while doing research on Rocky Mountain spotted fever, as did an aide of [[Noguchi Hideyo]] at the Rockefeller Institute.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Research began in 1922 in western Montana, in the [[Bitterroot Valley]] around [[Hamilton, Montana]], after the Governor's daughter and his son-in-law died of the fever. However, prior to that, in 1917, Dr. Lumford Fricks introduced herds of sheep into the Bitterroot Valley. His hypothesis was that the sheep would eat the tall grasses where ticks lived and bred.<ref>Steele, Volney, M.D. Bleed, Blister and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier.  Mountain Press Publishing Company, Missoula, Montana. 2005.</ref> Past Assistant Surgeon R.R. Spencer of the Hygienic Laboratory of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] was ordered to the region, and he led a research team at an abandoned schoolhouse through about 1924.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Spencer R.R. |author2=Parker R.R. |title=Studies on Rocky Mountain spotted fever |publisher=U.S. G.P.O. |location=Washington |year=1930 |oclc=16141346 |series=Hygienic Laboratory Bulletin |volume=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6C9DAAAAYAAJ}}<br /></ref><ref name="de_Kruif_1932">{{cite book |author=de Kruif, Paul |author-link=Paul de Kruif |chapter=Ch. 4 Spencer: In the Happy Valley |title=Men Against Death |publisher=Harcourt, Brace  |location=New York |year=1932 |oclc=11210642 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IokwAAAAIAAJ&q=editions:IokwAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> Spencer was assisted by R.

This [[vaccine]] worked, and for some years after it was used by people in that region to convert the illness from one with high fatality rate (albeit low incidence) to one that could be either prevented entirely (for many of them) or modified to a non-deadly form (for the rest).<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> Today there is no commercially available vaccine for RMSF<ref name="cdc"/> because, unlike in the 1920s when Spencer and colleagues developed one, antibiotics are now available to treat the disease, so prevention by vaccination is no longer the sole defense against likely death.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Much of the early research was conducted at [[Rocky Mountain Laboratories]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dir/rml/ |title=Rocky Mountain Laboratories Official Site |access-date=2009-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rmsf/overview.htm |title=Overview |work=Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |date=2018-10-26 }}</ref> a part of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]. The schoolhouse laboratory of 1922–1924, filled with ticks in various phases of the life cycle, is identified in retrospect as a [[biological hazard|biohazard]], although the team did not fully appreciate it at first. The deaths of Gettinger and Cowan, and the near death of the janitor's son, were the results of inadequate [[biocontainment]], but in the 1920s, the elaborate biocontainment systems of today had not been invented.

==Popular Culture==
In the 1936 film [[His Brother's Wife|''His Brother's Wife'']], Robert Taylor plays a doctor who is part of a team frustrated by their inability to find RMSF in ticks collected from plants in the jungle, while infected people die all around them. When they finally test ticks from infected goats, they find their source and save a colleague's life.

Research into this disease in Montana is a sub-plot of the 1937 film ''[[Green Light (1937 film)|Green Light]]'', starring [[Errol Flynn]]. Some of the researchers who perished are mentioned by name and their photographs are shown.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a big part of the 1947 [[Republic Pictures]] movie ''[[Driftwood (1947 film)|Driftwood]]'', starring [[Walter Brennan]], [[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]], [[Dean Jagger]], [[Natalie Wood]], and [[Hobart Cavanaugh]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

In December 2013, hockey player [[Shane Doan]] was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and returned to play in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://coyotes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=698862 | title='Yotes Notes: Doctors Give Doan OK to Play}}</ref>
