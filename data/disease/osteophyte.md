==Cause==

A range of bone-formation processes are associated with aging, degeneration, mechanical instability, and disease (such as [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]]). Osteophyte formation has classically been related to sequential and consequential changes in such processes. Often osteophytes form in osteoarthritic joints as a result of damage and wear from inflammation. Calcification and new bone formation can also occur in response to mechanical damage in joints.<ref

==Pathophysiology==
Osteophytes form because of the increase in a damaged joint's surface area. This is most common from the onset of [[arthritis]]. Osteophytes usually limit joint movement and typically cause pain.<ref name=Mayo>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bone-spurs/DS00627/DSECTION=6 Bone spurs] MayoClinic.com</ref>

Osteophytes form naturally on the back of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] as a person ages and are a [[clinical sign]] of [[Degeneration (medical)|degeneration]] in the spine. In this case, the osteophytes are commonly not the source of [[back pain]]s, but instead are a sign of an underlying problem. However, osteophytes on the spine can impinge on [[nerves]] that leave the spine for other parts of the body. This impingement can cause [[pain]] in both upper and lower limbs and a [[numbness]] or [[Tingling sensation|tingling]] [[sense|sensations]] in the [[hands]] and [[Foot|feet]] because the [[nerves]] are supplying sensation to their [[Dermatomic area|dermatomes]].<ref name=Mayo/>

Osteophytes on the fingers or toes are known as [[Heberden's nodes]] (if on the [[distal interphalangeal joint (disambiguation)|distal interphalangeal joint]]) or [[Bouchard's nodes]] (if on the [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s).

==Treatments==
Normally, asymptomatic cases are not treated. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and surgery are two typical options for cases requiring treatment.
