'''Babesiosis''' or  '''piroplasmosis''' is a [[malaria]]-like [[parasitic disease]] caused by infection with a [[eukaryotic]] parasite in the order [[Piroplasmida]], typically a ''[[Babesia]]'' or ''[[Theileria]]'', in the [[phylum]] [[Apicomplexa]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen A. |last1=Berger |first2=John S. |last2=Marr |title=Human Parasitic Diseases Sourcebook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AB39e6KZ8MMC |year=2006 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-2962-2 |access-date=2016-10-14 |archive-date=2013-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113073942/http://books.google.com/books?id=AB39e6KZ8MMC |url-status=live }}</ref> Human babesiosis [[Tick-borne disease|transmission via tick bite]] is most common in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and parts of Europe, and sporadic throughout the rest of the world.

Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as [[Lyme disease]].<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review" /> After [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s, ''Babesia'' is thought to be the second-most common blood [[parasite]] of mammals. They can have major adverse effects on the health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. In cattle, the disease is known as '''Texas cattle fever''' or '''redwater'''.<ref name="Hunfeld">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunfeld KP, Hildebrandt A, Gray JS |title=Babesiosis: Recent insights into an ancient disease |journal=Int J Parasitol |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1219–37 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.03.001 |pmid=18440005}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Half of all children and a quarter of previously healthy adults with ''Babesia'' infection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever and [[hemolytic anemia]], symptoms that are similar to those of malaria.<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review" /> People with symptoms usually become ill 1 to 4 weeks after the bite, or 1 to 9 weeks after transfusion of contaminated blood products. A person infected with babesiosis gradually develops [[malaise]] and fatigue, followed by a fever. Hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the blood, also develops. Chills, sweats, and [[thrombocytopenia]] are also common symptoms. Symptoms may last from several days to several months.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In more severe cases, symptoms similar to malaria occur, with fevers up to 40.5&nbsp;°C (105&nbsp;°F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolytic anemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis in people who have had a [[splenectomy]] can occur rapidly, consistent with [[overwhelming post-splenectomy infection]]. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with [[immunodeficiency]], such as [[HIV/AIDS]] patients.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

A reported increase in human babesiosis diagnoses in the 2000s is thought to be caused by more widespread testing and higher numbers of people with immunodeficiencies coming in contact with ticks, the disease vector.<ref name="Hunfeld"/> Little is known about the occurrence of ''Babesia'' species in malaria-[[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas, where ''Babesia'' can easily be misdiagnosed as ''[[Plasmodium]]''. Human patients with repeat babesiosis infection may exhibit [[premunity]].<ref name="ShawDay2005">{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan E.|last2=Day|first2=Michael J.|title=Arthropod-borne Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwE4yoj3LukC&pg=PA71|date=11 April 2005|publisher=Manson Publishing|isbn=978-1-84076-578-6|page=71|access-date=14 October 2016|archive-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626180318/http://books.google.com/books?id=OwE4yoj3LukC&pg=PA71|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Cause==
''Babesia'' species are in the [[phylum]] [[Apicomplexa]], which also has the protozoan parasites that cause [[malaria]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[cryptosporidiosis]].<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review" /> Four clades of ''Babesia'' species infect humans. The main species in each clade are:{{cn|date=August 2022}}
# ''B. microti'' (<3&nbsp;μm)
# ''B. <!-- duncani'' and ''B. --> duncani''
# ''B. divergens'' (cattle parasite seen mostly in Europe) and ''B.&nbsp;venatorum'' ([[roe deer]] parasite, formerly called EU1), most closely related to the large ''Babesia'' clade
# Large'' Babesia'' (>3&nbsp;μm) mostly infects [[ungulates]], but also includes K01 strain (an isolated case observed in South Korea, see [[#Isolated cases|isolated cases]])

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Babesia life cycle human en.svg|thumb|450px|''Babesia'' lifecycle]]
''Babesia'' parasites reproduce in [[red blood cell]]s, where they can be seen as cross-shaped inclusions (four [[merozoite]]s asexually budding, but attached together forming a structure looking like a "[[Maltese cross]]")<ref name="Noskoviak2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Noskoviak K, Broome E | title = Images in clinical medicine. Babesiosis | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 358 | issue = 17 | pages = e19 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434647 | doi =10.1056/NEJMicm070903 }}</ref> and cause hemolytic anemia, quite similar to malaria.

Unlike the ''Plasmodium'' parasites that cause malaria, ''Babesia'' species lack an exoerythrocytic phase, so the liver is usually not affected.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In nonhuman animals, ''[[Babesia canis]] rossi'', ''[[Babesia bigemina]]'', and ''[[Babesia bovis]]'' cause particularly severe forms of the disease, including a severe haemolytic anaemia, with positive erythrocyte-in-saline-agglutination test indicating an immune-mediated component to the haemolysis. Common sequelae include haemoglobinuria "red-water", disseminated intravascular coagulation, and "cerebral babesiosis" caused by sludging of erythrocytes in cerebral capillaries.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In bovine species, the organism causes hemolytic anemia, so an infected animal shows pale mucous membranes initially. As the levels of [[bilirubin]] (a byproduct of red blood cell lysis) continue to increase, the visible mucous membranes become yellow in color (icterus) due to the failure of the liver to metabolize the excess bilirubin.  Hemoglobinuria is seen due to excretion of red-blood-cell lysis byproducts via the kidneys. Fever of 40.5&nbsp;°C (105&nbsp;°F) develops due to release of inflammatory byproducts.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Diagnosis ==
Only specialized laboratories can adequately diagnose ''Babesia'' infection in humans, so ''Babesia'' infections are considered highly under-reported. It develops in patients who live in or travel to an endemic area or receive a contaminated [[blood transfusion]] within the preceding 9 weeks, so this aspect of the medical history is vital.<ref name="idsa-guidelines"/> Babesiosis may be suspected when a person with such an exposure history develops persistent fevers and hemolytic anemia. The definitive diagnostic test is the identification of parasites on a [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa-stained]] [[blood film|thin-film blood smear]].<ref name="idsa-guidelines">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED |title=The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clin.

So-called "Maltese cross formations" on the blood film are diagnostic ([[pathognomonic]]) of babesiosis, since they are not seen in malaria, the primary differential diagnosis.<ref name="Noskoviak2008"/> Careful examination of multiple [[smear test|smear]]s may be necessary, since ''Babesia'' may infect less than 1% of circulating red blood cells, thus be easily overlooked.<ref name="krause">{{cite journal |author=Krause PJ |title=Babesiosis diagnosis and treatment |journal=Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=45–51 |year=2003 |pmid=12804380 |doi=10.1089/153036603765627451 }}</ref>

[[Serology|Serologic testing]] for [[antibody|antibodies]] against ''Babesia'' (both [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] and [[IgM]]) can detect low-level infection in cases with a high clinical suspicion, but negative blood film examinations. Serology is also useful for differentiating babesiosis from malaria in cases where people are at risk for both infections. Since detectable antibody responses require about a week after infection to develop, serologic testing may be falsely negative early in the disease course.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Krause PJ, Telford SR, Ryan R |title=Diagnosis of babesiosis: evaluation of a serologic test for the detection of ''Babesia microti'' antibody |journal=J.

A [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) test has been developed for the detection of ''Babesia'' from the peripheral blood.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Persing DH, Mathiesen D, Marshall WF |title=Detection of Babesia microti by polymerase chain reaction |journal=J.

Other laboratory findings include decreased numbers of red blood cells and [[platelets]] on [[complete blood count]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In animals, babesiosis is suspected by observation of clinical signs (hemoglobinuria and anemia) in animals in endemic areas. Diagnosis is confirmed by observation of merozoites on thin film blood smear examined at maximum magnification under oil using Romonovski stains (methylene blue and eosin). This is a routine part of the veterinary examination of dogs and ruminants in regions where babesiosis is endemic.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

''Babesia canis'' and ''B.&nbsp;bigemina'' are "large ''Babesia'' species" that form paired merozoites in the erythrocytes, commonly described as resembling "two pears hanging together", rather than the "Maltese cross" of the "small ''Babesia'' species". Their merozoites are around twice the size of small ones.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Cerebral babesiosis is suspected ''in vivo'' when neurological signs (often severe) are seen in cattle that are positive for ''B.&nbsp;bovis'' on blood smear, but this has yet to be proven scientifically. Outspoken red discoloration of the grey matter ''post mortem'' further strengthens suspicion of cerebral babesiosis. Diagnosis is confirmed ''post mortem'' by observation of ''Babesia''-infected erythrocytes sludged in the cerebral cortical capillaries in a brain smear.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

== Treatment ==
Treatment of asymptomatic carriers should be considered if parasites are still detected after 3 months. In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice is a combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[azithromycin]]. This regimen is preferred to [[clindamycin]] and [[quinine]] because it has fewer side effects. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with [[relapsing]] disease. Even mild cases are recommended to be treated to decrease the chance of inadvertently transmitting the infection by donating blood.<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review"/> In severe babesiosis, the combination of clindamycin and quinine is preferred. In life-threatening cases, [[exchange transfusion]] is performed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tanyel |first1=Esra |last2=Guler |first2=Nil |last3=Hokelek |first3=Murat |last4=Ulger |first4=Fatma |last5=Sunbul |first5=Mustafa |title=A case of severe babesiosis treated successfully with exchange transfusion|journal=Int J Infect Dis|year=2015|pmid=26232090|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2015.07.019 |volume=38 |pages=83–5|doi-access=free }}</ref> In this procedure, the infected red blood cells are removed and replaced with uninfected ones.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

==History==
The disease is named for the genus of the causative organism,<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/babesia "babesia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424212822/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/babesia |date=2022-04-24 }} at [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]] online.</ref> which was named after the [[Romanian people|Romanian]] [[bacteriologist]] [[Victor Babeș]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|367|Victor Babeș}}</ref> In 1888, Victor Babeș identified the microorganisms in red blood cells as the cause of febrile [[hemoglobinuria]] in cattle.<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review">{{cite journal|last1=Vannier|first1=Edouard|last2=Krause|first2=Peter J.|title=Human Babesiosis|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=21 June 2012|volume=366|issue=25|pages=2397–2407|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1202018|pmid=22716978|s2cid=205116383 |url=https://dermatologycentral.typepad.com/files/nejmra1202018.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211112081212/https://dermatologycentral.typepad.com/files/nejmra1202018.pdf|archive-date=2021-11-12}}</ref> In 1893, [[Theobald Smith]] and Frederick Kilborne discovered that a tick was the vector for transmission in Texas cattle. The agent was ''B.&nbsp;bigemina''. This was the first demonstration that an [[arthropod]] could act as a [[disease vector]] to transmit an infectious agent to a vertebrate host.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

In 1957, the first human case was documented in a [[splenectomy|splenectomized]] Croatian herdsman.<ref name="NEJM Babesiosis Review" /> The agent was ''B.&nbsp;divergens''. In 1969, the first case was reported in an [[immunocompetent]] individual on Nantucket Island. The agent was ''B.&nbsp;microti'', and the vector was the tick ''[[Ixodes scapularis|I. scapularis]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Horse|Equine]] babesiosis (caused by the protozoan ''[[Theileria#Important species|Theileria equi]]'') is also known as piroplasmosis (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] {{Lang|la|piro}}, meaning [[pear]] + [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plasma'', a thing formed).<ref name=lexic>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexic.us/definition-of/piroplasma|title=Definition of Piroplasma|publisher=lexic.us|access-date=November 9, 2011|archive-date=November 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111142406/http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/Piroplasma|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Other animals==
Veterinary treatment of babesiosis does not normally use antibiotics. In livestock and  animals, [[diminazen]] (Berenil), [[imidocarb]], or [[trypan blue]] would be the drugs of choice for treatment of ''B.&nbsp;canis rossi'' (dogs in Africa), ''B.&nbsp;bovis'', and ''B.&nbsp;bigemina'' (cattle in Southern Africa).  In acute cases in cattle, blood transfusion may be carried out.  A vaccine is effective against ''B.&nbsp;canis canis'' (dogs in the Mediterranean region), but is ineffective against ''B.&nbsp;c.&nbsp;rossi''. ''B.&nbsp;imitans'' causes a mild form of the disease that frequently resolves without treatment (dogs in Southeast Asia).{{cn|date=January 2023}}
