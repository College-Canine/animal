'''Bladder stones''' or '''uroliths''' are a common occurrence in animals, especially in domestic animals such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/07/dietary-treatment-of-bladder-stones/|title=Dietary treatment of bladder stones|date=2017-07-26|website=Clinical Nutrition Service at Cummings School|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> Occurrence in other species, including [[tortoise]]s,<ref>[http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/Article.aspx/1057182?UserKey= Giant tortoise cheats death] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214149/http://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/Article.aspx/1057182?UserKey= |date=July 26, 2011 }} ("Evening Express", Aberdeen, 31/01/2009)</ref> has been reported as well. The stones form in the [[urinary bladder]] in varying size and numbers secondary to [[urinary tract infection|infection]], dietary influences, and [[genetics]].  Stones can form in any part of the urinary tract in dogs and cats, but unlike in humans, stones of the [[kidney]] are less common and do not often cause significant disease, although they can contribute to [[pyelonephritis]] and [[chronic kidney disease]].  Types of stones include [[struvite]], [[calcium oxalate]], [[uric acid|urate]], [[cystine]], [[calcium phosphate]], and [[silicate]].  Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are by far the most common.  Bladder stones are not the same as bladder crystals but if the crystals coalesce unchecked in the bladder they can become stones.

==Signs and symptoms==
Bladder stones may cause blood in the urine (animal)in the ([[hematuria]]) but sometimes there may be no signs at all.  Painful urination or straining to urinate are other signs.  Urinary tract infections are commonly associated with bladder stones.  Smaller stones may become lodged in the [[urethra]], especially in male animals, causing [[urinary retention|urinary tract obstruction]] and the inability to urinate.  This condition causes [[acute kidney failure]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[sepsis]], and death within a few days.

==Mechanism==
Oversaturation of [[urine]] with crystals is by far the biggest factor in stone formation in dogs and cats.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref> This oversaturation can be caused by increased excretion of crystals by the kidneys, water reabsorption by the [[renal tubule]]s resulting in concentration of the urine, and changes in urine [[pH]] that influence crystallization.  Other contributing factors include diet, frequency of urination, genetics, current medications, and the presence of a [[urinary tract infection]].

The stones form around a '''[[Enterolith|nidus]]''', which can consist of [[white blood cell]]s, [[bacteria]], and organic matrix mixed with crystals, or crystals alone.  The nidus makes up about two to ten percent of the mass of the stone.<ref name=Merck1>{{cite web | title = Urolithiasis: Overview | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/130615.htm | access-date = 2007-04-14 }}</ref>  It is possible for the nidus to be made of a different type of crystal than the rest of the stone, also known as [[epitaxy|epitaxial growth]].

Nutrition often plays a major role in the development of bladder stones. Sodium, calcium, phosphorus and potassium ratios and quantities play a large role in urinary health of animals. Research indicates that low dietary inclusion of potassium is associated with increased renal calcium excretion, which lowers urinary pH. By lowering urinary pH, the risk for development of calcium oxalate uroliths increases. By feeding proper amounts of calcium and potassium we avoid this issue, which is especially common in male cats.<ref>PaBlack, N., Brenten, T., Neumann, K., & Zentek, J. (2014). Effects of potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate in the diet on urinary pH and mineral excretion of adult cats. British Journal of Nutrition, 111(5), 785-797.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
When symptoms indicate bladder stones, the first step is usually to take an [[x-ray]].  Most types of stones will appear readily in an x-ray, urate and occasionally cystine stones being the most common exceptions.  Stones smaller than three millimeters may not be visible.<ref name=Merck1/>  [[Ultrasonography]] is also useful for identifying bladder stones.  Crystals identified in a [[urinalysis]] may help identify the stones, but analysis of the stones is necessary for identification of the complete chemical composition.

===Struvite stones===
[[Image:Struvite stones.JPG|thumb|Struvite stones]]
[[Struvite]] stones are also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate stones due to their chemical composition - MgNH<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O.  Often there is a small amount of calcium phosphate present.<ref name=Buffington>{{cite web | last = Buffington | first = Tony | title = Nutrition and Urolithiasis | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8608&O=Generic | access-date = 2006-07-16 }}</ref>  They form at a neutral to alkaline pH of the urine.  Bacterial infections contribute to their formation by increasing the pH of the urine through the [[urease]] enzyme in dogs.  More than 90 percent of dogs with struvite stones have an associated urease-producing bacterial infection in the urinary tract, but in cats struvite stones usually form in sterile urine.<ref name=Hoskins>{{cite journal | last = Hoskins | first = Johnny D. | title = Feline Urolithiasis | journal = DVM | pages = 6S–7S | publisher = Advanstar Communications | date = November 2006 }}</ref>  The appearance of the stones vary from large solitary stones to multiple smaller stones.  They can assume the shape of the bladder or urethra.

[[Image:Struvite crystals dog with scale 1.JPG|thumb|left|Struvite crystals]]
Dissolution of the struvite stones depends on acidification of the urine through diet or urinary [[acidifier]]s.  Special diets for dissolution also have reduced [[protein]], [[phosphorus]], and [[magnesium]], as well as increased salt to increase water consumption and dilute the urine.  The diet needs to be fed exclusively, but it can only be fed for a few months total due to potential side effects.  [[Contraindication]]s to this diet include [[heart failure]], [[liver failure]], [[kidney failure]], [[pancreatitis]], [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and [[hypoalbuminemia]] (low [[serum albumin]]).<ref name=Merck2>{{cite web | title = Canine Urolithiasis | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/130616.htm| access-date = 2007-04-14 }}</ref>  Prevention of struvite stones is with a similar diet with milder restrictions.

Certain dog breeds are predisposed to struvite stones, including [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s, [[Bichon Frise]]s, and [[Cocker Spaniel]]s.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  They are the most commonly reported bladder stone in female dogs and in [[ferret]]s (pregnant ferrets may be especially predisposed).<ref name=Hillyer_1997>{{cite book|author1=Hillyer, Elizabeth V. |author2=Quesenberry, Katherin E. |title=Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents: Clinical Medicine and Surgery|edition=1st|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1997|isbn=0-7216-4023-0}}</ref>  For frequency in cats, see below.

===Calcium oxalate stones===
[[Image:Calcium oxalate stones.JPG|thumb|left|Calcium oxalate stones]]
[[Calcium oxalate]] stones form in an acidic to neutral urine.  Two types naturally occur, calcium oxalate monohydrate, or [[whewellite]] (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O), and calcium oxalate dihydrate, or [[weddellite]] (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O).  Their appearance can be rough, smooth, spiculated (needle-like), or [[Knucklebones|jacks]]tone.  Calcium oxalate stones form more readily in animals with [[hypercalcaemia]], which can be caused by [[Addison's disease]] or certain types of [[cancer]].  Hypercalcaemia results in [[hypercalciuria]], which can also be caused by [[Cushing's syndrome (veterinary)|Cushing's syndrome]] or [[hyperparathyroidism]].

There is no recommended diet to dissolve calcium oxalate stones. For prevention a diet low in protein and [[oxalate]]s and high in magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium is recommended. Increased dietary magnesium and phosphorus decreases the amount of calcium in the urine, and increased dietary calcium reduces absorption of oxalates from the intestines.<ref name="WVC">{{cite book|last=Zoran|first=Debra|title=Role of Diet in Feline and Canine Urolithiasis|date=2006}}</ref> [[Potassium citrate]] has been recommended to prevent calcium oxalate stone formation because it forms a soluble complex with oxalates and promotes the formation of alkaline urine.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

Dog breeds possibly prone to calcium oxalate stones include [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s, [[Lhasa Apso]]s, [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s, [[Miniature Poodle]]s, [[Shih Tzu]]s, and [[Bichon Frise]]s.<ref name=Merck2/>  They are the most common stone in male dogs.<ref name=WVC/>  Calcium oxalate stones are also common in [[domestic rabbit]]s.  Rabbits are prone to hypercalciuria due to intestinal absorption of calcium not being dependent on [[vitamin D]] and a high fractional urinary excretion of calcium.<ref name=Hillyer_1997/>  The urine will appear thick and creamy or sometimes sandy.  Small stones and sand can be removed using urohydropropulsion.  Prevention is through reducing calcium intake by feeding more hay and less  commercial rabbit pellets, and by not using mineral supplements.

===Frequency of struvite and calcium oxalate stones in cats===
The [http://www.cvm.umn.edu/depts/minnesotaurolithcenter/home.html Minnesota Urolith Center] at the [[University of Minnesota]] College of Veterinary Medicine has done detailed analysis of uroliths from animals since 1981 and has noted changing trends in feline uroliths.  In 1981, struvite stones were the most common type in cats, making up 78 percent of submitted samples, with only 2 percent comprising calcium oxalate stones.  In the mid 1980s there was a substantial increase in the number of calcium oxalate samples, and between 1994 and 2002, 55 percent of feline stones were calcium oxalate and 33 percent were struvite.  This may have been caused by the use of dissolution diets for struvite stones in cats and modification of other diets to prevent struvite crystal formation.  These modifications predisposed to calcium oxalate crystal formation.  However, in 2004, struvite stones once again surpassed calcium oxalate stones 44.9 percent to 44.3 percent, and in 2006, 50 percent of stones were struvite and 39 percent were calcium oxalate.  This may have been due to the increased use of diets designed to prevent calcium oxalate crystal formation, which because of increased magnesium in the diet and decreased acidity of the urine help promote struvite crystal formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Osborne | first = Carl A. |author2=Lulich, Jody P. | title = Changing trends in composition of feline uroliths and urethral plugs | journal = DVM | pages = 38–40 | publisher = Advanstar Communications | date = February 2007 }}</ref>

[[Urethra]]l plugs in cats are usually composed of struvite crystals and organic matter.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/vr.152.20.625 |vauthors=Escolar E, Bellanato J |title=Analysis of feline urinary calculi and urethral plugs by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy |journal=Vet Rec |volume=152 |issue=20 |pages=625–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12790167|s2cid=33483919 }}</ref>

===Urate stones===
[[Image:Urate stones.JPG|thumb|Urate stones]]
[[Urate]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) stones, usually ammonium urate (NH<sub>4</sub>·C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or sodium urate monohydrate (Na·C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>×H<sub>2</sub>O), form in an acidic to neutral urine.  They are usually small, yellow-brown, smooth stones.  Urate stones form due to an increased excretion of [[uric acid]] in the urine.  [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]]s (especially males)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Albasan H, Lulich J, Osborne C, Lekcharoensuk C |title=Evaluation of the association between sex and risk of forming urate uroliths in Dalmatians |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=565–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16117063 |doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.565|doi-access=free }}</ref> and to a lesser extent [[Bulldog]]s are genetically predisposed to the formation of urate stones because of an altered metabolism of [[purine]]s.  Dalmatians have a decreased rate of urate hepatic transport, leading to only about 30 to 40 percent conversion of urate to [[allantoin]], compared with greater than 90 percent conversion in other breeds.<ref name=Merck2/>  Dogs with [[portosystemic shunt]]s or endstage liver disease also have increased uric acid excretion in the urine due to reduced conversion of uric acid to [[allantoin]] and [[ammonia]] to [[urea]].  Urate stones make up about six percent of all stones in the cat.<ref>{{cite web | title = Feline Urolithiasis and Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/130617.htm | access-date = 2007-04-14 }}</ref>

Urate stones can be dissolved using a diet with reduced purines that alkalinizes and dilutes the urine.  [[Allopurinol]] is used in dogs with altered purine metabolism to prevent the formation of uric acid.  Feeding a diet high in purines while simultaneously administering allopurinol can result in the formation of [[xanthine]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) stones.

===Cystine stones===
[[Cystine]] ((SCH<sub>2</sub>CHNH<sub>2</sub>COOH)<sub>2</sub>) stones form in an acidic to neutral urine.  They are usually smooth and round.  They are caused by increased urine excretion of cystine (a relatively insoluble amino acid) in dogs with a defect in [[renal tubule]] reabsorption of cystine.  Dietary reduction of protein and alkalinization of the urine may help prevent formation.  Medications such as [[D-penicillamine]] and [[2-MPG]] contain [[thiol]], which forms a soluble complex with cystine in the urine.<ref name=WVC/>  Dog breeds possibly predisposed to formation of cystine stones include Bulldogs, [[Dachshund]]s, [[Basset Hound]]s, [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]s, Yorkshire Terriers, [[Irish Terrier]]s, and [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]]s.  In Newfoundlands, cystinuria is inherited as an [[recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] trait, but in the other breeds it is a [[sex linkage|sex linked]] trait and found primarily in male dogs.<ref name=Merck2/>

===Calcium phosphate stones===
[[Calcium phosphate]], also known as hydroxyapatite (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>), stones form in neutral to alkaline urine.  They are usually smooth and round.  Calcium phosphate is usually a component of struvite or calcium oxalate stones and is infrequently a pure stone.   They form more readily with hypercalcaemia.  Dog breeds possibly predisposed to calcium phosphate stone formation include Yorkshire Terriers, Miniature Schnauzers, and Cocker Spaniels.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

===Silicate stones===
[[Silicate]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) stones form in acidic to neutral urine.  They are usually [[jackstone]] in appearance.  There is possibly an increased incidence associated with dogs on diets that have a large amount of corn [[gluten]] or [[soybean]] hulls.  Dog breeds possibly predisposed include [[German Shepherd Dog]]s, [[Golden Retriever]]s, [[Labrador Retriever]]s, and Miniature Schnauzers.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

==Treatment==
Reasons for treatment of bladder stones include recurring symptoms and risk of urinary tract obstruction.  Some stones, including struvite and urate stones, can be dissolved using dietary modifications and/or medications. Calcium oxalate stones are not able to be dissolved and must be surgically removed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/07/dietary-treatment-of-bladder-stones/|title=Dietary treatment of bladder stones|last=Team|first=Clinical Nutrition|date=2017-07-26|website=Clinical Nutrition Service at Cummings School|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Small stones in female dogs may possibly be removed by [[urohydropropulsion]], a nonsurgical procedure.  Urohydropropulsion is performed under sedation by filling the bladder with saline through a catheter, holding the dog vertically, and squeezing the bladder to expel the stones through the urethra.  Bladder stones can be removed surgically by a [[cystotomy]], which is a small incision into the bladder to scoop out the stones. Stones lodged in the urethra can often be flushed into the bladder and removed, but sometimes a [[urethrotomy]] is necessary.  In male dogs with recurrent urinary tract obstruction a [[scrotal urethrostomy]] creates a permanent opening in the urethra proximal to the area where most stones lodge, behind the [[os penis]].  In male cats, stones lodge where the urethra narrows in the penis.  Recurrent cases can be treated surgically with a [[perineal urethrostomy]], which removes the penis and creates a new opening for the urethra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/struvite-bladder-stones-in-dogs|title=Struvite Bladder Stones in Dogs|website=vca_corporate|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>

To prevent recurrence of stones, special diets can be used for each type of stone.  Increasing water consumption by the animal dilutes the urine, which prevents oversaturation of the urine with crystals.
