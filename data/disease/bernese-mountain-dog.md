The '''Bernese Mountain Dog''' ({{lang-de|Berner Sennenhund}}) is a large [[dog breed]] from [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[Swiss Alps]], being one of the four breeds of [[Sennenhund]]-[[dog type|type]] dogs, with roots in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mastiff]]s. The name ''Berner'' (or ''Bernese'' in [[English language|English]]) refers to the breed's area of origin in the [[canton of Bern]], and ''Sennenhund'' is derived from the German ''Senne'' ("alpine pasture") and ''Hund'' ("hound/dog"), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called ''Senn''. This breed was originally kept as a general [[working dog|farm dog]] and large Sennenhunde in the past were also used as [[draft animals]] pulling carts. The breed was officially established in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bshkbs.ch/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News&file=categories&op=newindex&catid=13 |title=100th Anniversary |publisher=Swiss Club for Bernese Mountain Dogs |year=2007 |access-date=January 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706223148/http://www.bshkbs.ch/phpnuke/modules.php?name=News |archive-date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>

== Four breeds of Sennenhund ==
The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name, followed by the most popular English version of the breed name are:

* Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, [[Greater Swiss Mountain Dog]]
* Berner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog
* [[Appenzeller Sennenhund]], Appenzeller Mountain Dog
* Entlebucher Sennenhund, [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]]

[[File:Bernese Mountain Dog - 9 months.JPG|thumb|upright|An eight-month-old Bernese Mountain Dog puppy]]

=== Colouring ===
Like the other Sennenhund, the Bernese mountain dog is a large, heavy dog with a distinctive tri-coloured [[coat (dog)|coat]], black with white chest and rust-coloured markings above eyes, sides of the mouth, front of legs, and out around the white chest. However, it is the only breed of [[Swiss mountain dog|Sennenhund]] dogs with a long coat.<ref name="AKCWorking" /> The ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horseshoe shape around the nose, which is always black.<ref name="Bernese Mountain Dog">{{Cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/|title=Bernese Mountain Dog|website=AKC|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> There is a white "Swiss cross" on the chest when viewed from the front. A "Swiss kiss" is a white mark located typically behind the neck, but may be a part of the neck. A full ring would not meet the type standard. The AKC breed standard lists, as disqualifications, blue eye colour and any ground colour other than black.<ref name="Standard">{{cite web |url=http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/045A2002_en.doc |title=Bernese Mountain Dog (Berner Sennenhund, Dürrbächler) |date=May 5, 2003 |access-date=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501091836/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/045A2002_en.doc |archive-date=May 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="AKC Standard">{{cite web|title=Bernese Mountain Dog: Breed Standard|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/#standard|website=American Kennel Club|access-date=4 July 2014|date=28 March 1990}}</ref>

=== Physical traits ===
Considered a [[Dry-mouthed dog|dry-mouthed]] breed,<ref name="Bernese Mountain Dog" /> the Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than it is tall, highly muscular, with a strong, wide back.<ref name="AKCWorking" />  The head of a Bernese mountain dog is flat on the top with a moderate stop, and the ears are medium-sized, triangular, set high, and rounded at the top. The teeth have a scissors bite. The legs of the Bernese are straight and strong, with round, arched toes. The [[dewclaws]] of the Bernese are often removed. Its bushy tail is carried low.

==Temperament==
The [[breed standard (dog)|breed standard]] for the Bernese mountain dog states that dogs should not be "aggressive, anxious or distinctly shy", but rather should be "good-natured", "self-assured", "placid towards strangers", and "docile". It only attacks if really needed (its owner is getting attacked).<ref name="AKC Standard"/> The temperament of individual dogs may vary, and not all examples of the breed have been bred carefully to follow the standard. All large breed dogs should be well socialized when they are puppies, and given regular training and activities throughout their lives.

Bernese are outdoor dogs at heart, though well-behaved in the house; they need activity and exercise, but do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when motivated. If they are sound (no problems with their hips, elbows, or other joints), they enjoy hiking and generally stick close to their people.<ref name="PetWave Temperament">{{cite web|url=http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Dog-Breed-Center/Working-Group/Bernese-Mountain-Dog/Personality.aspx|title=Bernese Mountain Dog {{!}} Temperament & Personality|work=Bernese Mountain Dog Breed|publisher=PetWave|access-date=4 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902080705/http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Dog-Breed-Center/Working-Group/Bernese-Mountain-Dog/Personality.aspx|archive-date=2 September 2012}}</ref> Not being given the adequate amount of exercise may lead to barking and harassing in the Bernese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Too little exercise leads to agitated canine: Ask Dog Lady|url=http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2012/12/too_little_exercise_leads_to_a.html|publisher=Cleveland Plain Dealer|access-date=11 December 2012|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>

Bernese mountain dogs are a breed that generally does well with children, as they are very affectionate. They are patient dogs that take well to children climbing over them.  Though they have great energy, a Bernese will also be happy with a calm evening.<ref name="PetWave Temperament"/>

Bernese work well with other pets and around strangers.<ref name="PetWave Temperament"/>  They are excellent guardians.  They tend to bond with one owner or family, and are somewhat aloof and standoffish towards strangers.<ref name="Pugnetti"/><ref>{{cite book |first1=Elizabeth Meriwether |last1=Schuler |title=Simon & Schuster's Guide to Dogs |year=1980 |publisher=Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., [[Simon & Schuster]]|location=Milano |page=45}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmdca.org/breed_education/pdf/01_bernese_basics_about.pdf|title=BMDCA Info Series|date=2013|website=BMDCA|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref><ref name="AKCWorking" />

== History ==
[[File:Adam, Benno, Bernese Mountain Dog and Her Pups.jpg|thumb|[[Benno Adam]], ''Bernese Mountain Dog and Her Pups'', 1862]]

Historically, in some locales at least, the breed was called a ''Dürrbachhund''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_3_1.html |title=Historical photos of the Berner Sennenhund (Bernese Mountain Dog) |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Bern|Naturhistorisches Museum der Burgermendiz Bern]] |access-date=January 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111084048/http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_3_1.html |archive-date=January 11, 2011 }}.

The dogs have roots in the Roman [[mastiffs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canismajor.com/dog/bernese.html |title=Bernese Mountain Dog |work=Dog Owner's Guide |access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilcox |first1=Bonnie |first2=Chris |last2=Walkowicz |title=The Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World |edition=4th |volume=1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofdogbreeds00bonn/page/188 188] |chapter=Bernese Mountain Dog |year=1993 |orig-date=1989 |isbn=978-0-86622-855-8 |location=Neptune City, NJ |publisher=[[TFH Publications]] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofdogbreeds00bonn/page/188 |chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref>

The breed was used as an all-purpose [[Working dog|farm dog]] for guarding property and to drive dairy cattle long distances from the farm to the alpine pastures. The farmers used the dogs to transport their carts of milk and cheese and were known by the locals as "Cheese Dogs."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The dog encyclopedia|editor=Bryan, Kim |publisher=DK Publishing |year=2013|isbn=978-1-4654-0844-0 |location=New York|oclc=812257274}}</ref> In the early 1900s, [[Animal fancy|fanciers]] exhibited the few examples of the large dogs at [[conformation show|shows]] in Berne, and in 1907 a few breeders from the Burgdorf region founded the first [[breed club (dog)|breed club]], the ''Schweizerische Dürrbach-Klub'', and wrote the first [[breed standard (dog)|Standard]] which defined the dogs as a separate breed. By 1910, there were already 107 registered members of the breed. There is a photo of a working Bernese Mountain Dog, dated 1905 at the Fumee Fall rest area in [[Quinnesec, Michigan]].

In 1937, the [[American Kennel Club]] recognized it;<ref name="AKCBerner">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/detail/#history |title=Bernese Mountain Dog History |publisher= American Kennel Club |access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> today, the club classifies it as a member of the [[Working Group (dog)|Working Group]].<ref name="AKCWorking">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/working/ |title=AKC Working Group |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref> In the US the Bernese Mountain Dog is growing in popularity, ranking in 22nd place by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 2017.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ American Kennel Club 2017 Dog Registration Statistics Historical Comparisons & Notable Trends], ''The American Kennel Club'', Retrieved 30 April 2014</ref>

These dogs are very popular as family dogs in German-speaking countries, where they are among the most popular dog breeds (for example, the German Association of Dog Breeders listed the Bernese at the 11th rank per live births in 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vdh.de/ueber-den-vdh/welpenstatistik/|title=Welpenstatistik der VDH-Mitgliedsvereine- Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen (VDH)|last=(VDH)|first=Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen|website=www.vdh.de|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>).

Bernese Mountain Dogs have an unusually high mortality due to musculoskeletal causes. [[Arthritis]], [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], and [[cruciate ligament]] rupture were reported as the cause of death in 6% of Bernese Mountain Dogs in the UK study;<ref name="KC Survey"/> for comparison, mortality due to musculoskeletal ailments was reported to be less than 2% for pure-bred dogs in general. Owners of Bernese Mountain Dogs are nearly three times as likely as owners of other breeds to report [[musculoskeletal]] problems in their dogs;<ref name="KC Survey"/> the most commonly reported being [[Anterior cruciate ligament|cruciate ligament]] rupture, [[arthritis]] (especially in shoulders and elbows), [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], and [[osteochondritis]].<ref name="KC Survey"/><ref name="Berner Club"/>  The age at onset for musculoskeletal problems is also unusually low. In the U.S./Canada study, 11% of living dogs had arthritis at an average age of 4.3 years.<ref name="Berner Club"/>  Most other common, non-musculoskeletal morbidity issues strike Berners at rates similar to other breeds.<ref name="KC Survey"/> Prospective Bernese Mountain Dog owners should be prepared to cope with a large dog that may have mobility problems at a young age. Options to help mobility-impaired dogs may include ramps for car or house access, lifting harnesses and slings, and dog wheelchairs (ex: [[Walkin' Wheels]]). Comfortable bedding may help alleviate joint pain. Due to these common medical issues, owners of Bernese Mountain Dogs should make sure that their dogs receive [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] and CERF certificates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernese Mountain Dogs |url=https://2puppies.com/breeds/173/bernese-mountain-dog |website=2Puppies |access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref>

*A 2020 United States study offered a general conclusion with emphasis on "mountain dogs":
<blockquote>As previously reported, body size was negatively correlated with lifespan. [[Gonadectomy]] was associated with a longer lifespan, with the effect being stronger in females than in males. This lifespan advantage was conserved in gonadectomized female dogs that lived to at least ages 5 and 8 years. We did not find significant differences in lifespan between purebred and mixed breed dogs; however, breeds with larger effective population sizes and/or lower inbreeding coefficients had median survival times 3–6 months longer than breeds with smaller effective population sizes or higher inbreeding coefficients, indicating that these measures of genetic diversity may be affecting breed lifespans. We also found that dog breeds belonging to the “Mountain” ancestral group had median survival times that were 3.5–4.6 years shorter than other purebred dog groups, which remained significant even when correcting for body size.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Urfer |first1= Sylvan R. |last2=Kaeberlein |first2=Matt |last3=Promislow |first3=Daniel E.

== Care ==
===Activities===

The Bernese's calm temperament makes them a natural for pulling small carts or wagons, a task they originally performed in Switzerland. With proper training they enjoy giving children rides in a cart or participating in a parade, such as the [[Conway, New Hampshire]] holiday parade.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young-Knox|first=Sara|title=Conway celebrates with jolly holiday parade|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20121203/NEWHAMPSHIRE02/121209823/1015/news13|publisher=The Union Leader|access-date=10 December 2012|date=2 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226103516/http://www.unionleader.com/article/20121203/NEWHAMPSHIRE02/121209823/1015/news13|archive-date=2013-12-26}}</ref> Regional Bernese clubs often offer [[carting]] workshops.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite episode |title=Afghan Hound, Alaskan Malamute, Bernese Mountain Dog, Cairn Terrier, Portuguese Water Dog |series=Dogs 101 |network=Animal Planet |date=24 October 2009 |season=2 |number=4 |minutes=60 }}</ref> Carting competitions are held for the breed.{{efn-ua|For example, the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America offers drafting trials open to all breeds; dogs can earn eight different titles—four as individual dogs (Novice Draft Dog, Advanced Novice Draft Dog, Draft Dog, and Master Draft Dog) and four brace titles, in which two dogs work one cart together.

===Grooming===
{{See also|Dog grooming}}
Bernese Mountain Dogs shed year-round, and the heaviest shedding is during seasonal changes. Usually the Bernese will only require a brushing once a week, with more in spring and fall, to keep its coat neat and reduce the amount of fur on the floor and furniture. The Bernese will only require a bath about once every couple of months or so, depending on how high its activity level is and how often it spends its time in the dirt.<ref name="PetWave Appearance">{{cite web|url=http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Dog-Breed-Center/Working-Group/Bernese-Mountain-Dog/Appearance.aspx|title=Bernese Mountain Dog Appearance & Personality|work=Bernese Mountain Dog Breed|publisher=PetWave|access-date=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911144851/http://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Dog-Breed-Center/Working-Group/Bernese-Mountain-Dog/Appearance.aspx|archive-date=11 September 2012}}</ref>

Special attention should be paid to the ears of the Bernese Mountain Dog, as they can trap bacteria, dirt, and liquid. The risk of an ear infection drops with weekly ear cleanings using a veterinarian-recommended cleanser.<ref name="PetWave Appearance" />
