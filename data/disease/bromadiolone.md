[[File:Rattenvergifwaarschuwing edit.JPG|thumb|right|Warning label on a tube of rat poison containing bromadiolone on a [[Levee|dike]] of the [[Scheldt]] river in Steendorp, Belgium]]
'''Bromadiolone''' is a potent [[anticoagulant]] [[rodenticide]]. It is a second-generation [[4-Hydroxycoumarins|4-hydroxycoumarin]] derivative and [[vitamin K antagonist]], often called a "super-[[warfarin]]" for its added potency and tendency to accumulate in the liver of the poisoned organism. When first introduced to the UK market in 1980, it was effective against rodent populations that had become resistant to first generation anticoagulants.

The product may be used both indoors and outdoors for rats and mice.

It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.<ref name="gov-right-know">{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = July 1, 2008 | access-date = October 29, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225051612/http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | archive-date = February 25, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

== Toxicity ==
[[File:Bromadiolone paste.jpg|thumb|Paste contains bromadiolone (0.005%)]]
Bromadiolone can be absorbed through the digestive tract, through the lungs, or through skin contact. The pesticide is generally given orally.<ref name=Bromadiolone>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pds/pds/pest88_e.htm Bromadiolone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061221043656/http://www.inchem.org/documents/pds/pds/pest88_e.htm |date=December 21, 2006 }}</ref> The substance is a vitamin K antagonist. The lack of [[vitamin K]] in the circulatory system reduces [[Blood Clotting|blood clotting]] and will cause death due to [[internal hemorrhaging]].<ref name="Bromadiolone"/>

Poisoning does not show effects for 24 to 36 hours after it is eaten and can take up to 2–5 days to cause death.{{Clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

== Chemistry ==
The compound is used as a mixture of four [[stereoisomer]]s. Its two stereoisomeric centers are at the phenyl- and the hydroxyl-substituted carbons in the carbon chain of the substituent at the 3 position of the [[coumarin]].
