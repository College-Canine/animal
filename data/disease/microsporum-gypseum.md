'''''Microsporum gypseum''''' is a soil-associated [[dermatophyte]] that occasionally is known to colonise and infect the [[Epidermis|upper dead layers]] of the skin of mammals.<ref name=rippon1988 /> The name refers to an asexual "form-taxon" that has been associated with four related biological species of fungi: the pathogenic taxa ''[[Arthroderma incurvatum]]'', ''[[A. gypsea]]'', ''[[A. fulva]]'' and the non-pathogenic [[saprotroph]] ''[[A. corniculata]]''.<ref name=currah/><ref name=demange /> More recent studies have restricted ''M. gypseum'' to two teleomorphic species ''A. gypseum'' and ''A. incurvatum''.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /> The [[conidium|conidial]] states of ''A. fulva'' and ''A. corniculata'' have been assigned to ''M. fulvum'' and ''M. boullardii''.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Because the [[anamorph]]ic states of these fungi are so similar, they can be identified reliably only by mating.<ref name=rippon1988 /> Two mating strains have been discovered, "+" and "–".<ref name=kane1997 /> The classification of this species has been based on the characteristically rough-walled, blunt, club-shaped, multicelled [[conidia|macroconidia]].<ref name=howard2003 /> Synonyms include ''Achorion gypseum'', ''Microsporum flavescens'', ''M. scorteum'', and ''M. xanthodes''.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> There has been past [[nomenclature|nomenclatural]] confusion in the usage of the generic names ''Microsporum'' and ''Microsporon''.<ref name=barron1983 />

==History==
The [[teleomorph]]ic states of this species were originally the first to be discovered<ref name=demange /> by Arturo Nannizii for ''M. gypseum'' in 1927, but his contribution was largely ignored by the scientific community.<ref name=kane1997 /> Until Christine Dawson and J.C. Gentles discovered anamorph ''Arthroderma uncurvatum'', the teleomorph of ''Trichophyton ajelloi''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after this, D.M. Griffin rediscovered ''M. gypseum'' by Nanizzi, and another individual P.M. Stockdale also isolated the second teleomorph of the species naming it ''Nannizzia incurvatum''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Stockdale then confirmed that ''Nannizzia incurvatum'' differed from the original isolate of ''M. gypseum'' isolated by Nannizzi and proposed that two teleomorphic states of ''M. gypseum'' exist for the anamorph, thereby naming the latter ''N. gypsea''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Various authors, such as Stockdale, M.F. Visset, and J.W. Rippon have agreed that the differences in structure of the [[anamorph]]ic state of the complex of ''M. gypseum'' are inadequate for making distinctions between anamorphic states because of how similar they look.<ref name=demange /> It is now believed that very similar anamorphs, ''M. gypseum'' and ''M. fulvum'', consist of three teleomorphs: ''N. gypsea'', ''N. incurvatum'', and ''N. fulva''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after, ''[[Arthroderma]]'' replaced ''[[Nannizzia]]'',<ref name=versalovic/> where ''[[Arthroderma]]'' is depicting the teleomorphic states, and ''Microsporum'' refers to the anamorphic states.<ref name=kane1997 />

==Morphology==
[[File:Microsporum gypseum colony.JPG|thumb|alt=Powdery fungal colony.|Colony of ''Microsporum gypseum'' on Sabouraud agar]]
The colonies of ''M. gypseum'' are described as cottony or powdery, they grow rapidly with a colour range of white to buff, with a reserve that can range from pink, to red, to yellow (cinnamon); they may occasionally have overtones of violet.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=barron1983 /><ref name=versalovic/> The powdery appearance of the colony is due to the abundant production of [[macroconidia]] on the older mycelium, while the edges of the colony are described as scalloped to ragged and can exhibit [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|pleomorphism]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /> [[Macroconidia]] of ''M. gypseum'' have a substantial range that can occur as short pedicels, terminal, solitary, spindle shaped, large, thick walled, that are smooth or roughened,<ref name=barron1983 /> borne directly on [[hyphae]] or on short branches.<ref name=barron1983 /> They are often very large (e.g., 40–150 x 8–15&nbsp;μm), [[ellipsoid]] to [[wikt:Special:Search/fusiform|fusiform]], moderately thick, have [[verrucose]] and are 4–6 [[septate]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[macroconidia]] also possess a rat-like tail at the edges of the [[conidia]].<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[ascoma]] of the fungus is a globose, appendaged gymnothecium that is pale buff in colour and 500–1250 μm in diameter.<ref name=howard2003 /> The peridial [[hyphae]] are hyaline, pale buff, septate, and are branched with thinly but have densely verrucose walls.<ref name=howard2003 /> [[Microconidia]] are drop shaped, clavate, (1.7–3.5 x 3.3–8.3&nbsp;μm), unicellular, smooth-walled or can be slightly roughened and are created laterally on the [[hyphae]].<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=versalovic/> The abundance of [[microconidia]] is characteristic of the fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /> The [[hyphae]] or appendages are of three kinds in the fungi, the first being straight, slender, smooth walled [[hyphae]] that can grow up to 250&nbsp;μm long; they taper at 2.5–4.0&nbsp;μm in diameter at the base but close to about 1.5-2&nbsp;μm. The second are slender, smooth-walled, septate, spiral [[hyphae]] that are rarely branched, which have a base diameter of 2.5–3.5&nbsp;μm that taper up to 1.5-2&nbsp;μm in diameter. They are usually variable in their coiled state, ranging from tightly to loosely coiled with numerous but variable numbers of turns. The third are thick-walled, verruculose, ellipsoid or fusiform [[macroconidia]], that are 35–55 x 10–13.5&nbsp;μm, with up to five septa.<ref name=howard2003 /> The [[ascus|asci]] of the fungus are subglobose, thin-walled, evanescent, which are 5-7&nbsp;μm in diameter and contain a total of eight [[ascospore]]s.<ref name=howard2003 /> The ascospores are smooth-walled, lenticular, 1.5–2 x 2.5–4&nbsp;μm in diameter, and when in mass are yellow.<ref name=howard2003 /> Additionally, the spiral hyphal appendages that ornament the ascomata are often produced spontaneously in culture in the absence of gymnothecia.<ref name=howard2003 /> The fungus does not have any specific nutritional requirements for growth.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The teleomorphic features of the microsporum on colonial and microscopic features are often done on Takashio's Medium.<ref name=versalovic/> However, distinguishing is best done by mating (+/–) or by genetics.<ref name=versalovic/> The species is [[heterothallic]], and a such mating is controlled by a 1-locus, 2-allele compatibility system.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Comparatively ''A. gypseum'' produces more spreading and a coarser granular colony; the [[macroconidia]] also are wider and the surface colour is brighter and redder than ''A. incurvatum''. Colonies of ''A. incurvatum'' are pale buff in colour and finely granular, occasionally with a reddish to yellow reverse.<ref name=rippon1988 />

==Ecology==
The species is [[geophilic]], is abundant in soil and can be isolated around the world; it is in world wide distribution.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> However, it is rare in places such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany but common in South America.<ref name=kane1997 /> It is defined to be either cosmopolitan or confined to a certain graphical regions.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The fungus can be found in soil of [[greenhouse]]s and [[munition]] factories within these areas.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The species itself commonly infects humans whom are closely tied to these areas because of agricultural work.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=soil /> In these areas, soil moisture is indicative role in the presence of the ''M. gypseum'' complex, areas with higher moisture tend to be preferred.<ref name=ranganathan /> Correlations between infections and soil types indicate that most improved soils of the clayey or clayey-sandy type are preferred, particularly those fertilized with [[keratin]]ous manure.<ref name=soil /> Additionally the fungus prefers soils with a pH of 7-7.5. Various soils in correlation with number of infections indicates that the fungus specifically prefers [[chernozemic soil]] (74%), of which positive isolates occur.<ref name=soil />

The role of infection by the fungi is influenced by the climate and geographical characteristics which favor the life of the [[dermatophyte]] as dictated by the average rainfall rate and average air temperatures.<ref name=soil /> There tends to be a greater number of infections in later seasons as emphasis is placed on age, sex, months of onset of infection, and marked localization of the fungus.<ref name=soil /> Adults, particularly males are typically infected, and of those infected usually involved in agricultural practices,<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil /> such as greenhouses and plant nursery workers.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> School-age males are more prone than females because of contact in the soil.<ref name=soil /> Onset of infection usually occurs from August to November, when humans come into contact with soil more often.<ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil />

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Microsporum gypseum2418.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Circular red skin lesion surrounded by skin scale.|Ringworm lesion on forearm caused by ''Microsporum gypseum'', incurred from fomite exposure through handling of firewood]]
The species is [[keratin]]ophilic and is known for causing diseases on human skin.<ref name=barron1983 /> The genus ''Microsporum'' contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals.<ref name=barron1983 /> The diseases it causes is classified as [[tinea]] or [[ringworm]], with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part.<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> Infection usually occurs as [[tinea capitis]] with suppuration and [[kerion]] formation.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Pus formation can also occur from palpitated [[hair follicle]]s.<ref name=rippon1988 /> The species is [[ectothrix]] in terms of hair infection and can infect more than one part of the scalp at a time.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces [[fronds]] (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex near the edge of the cuticles.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp.<ref name=rippon1988 /> Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response.<ref name=rippon1988 /> [[Tinea corporis]], as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone.<ref name=rippon1988 /> Also, tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while tinea unguium is rare.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular [[granuloma]]tous [[perifolliculitis]], has been noted with infection of the thighs.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> [[Favus]], (a severe form of [[tinea capitis]]) is rarely seen to be caused by this fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> However the most common cause in humans seems to be tinea capitis and [[tinea corporis]].<ref name=howard2003 /> As such clinical manifestations are localized to localization of contact.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Transmission from animals to humans is supported; especially in those constrained to agricultural work.<ref name=soil /><ref name=Romano /> Handlers of laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits can also be at risk of contracting the fungi if the animals were predisposed to a certain area.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The fungus infects animals that associate themselves with soil on a repeated basis.<ref name=howard2003 /> So as such animals like cattle are commonly affected but horses, rodents, monkeys and dogs have a tendency to acquire it.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Entry of the fungus or contraction of one or more of these diseases is caused by deposition on human skin, and contact with soil is usually the primary cause of infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Quantitatively, animal or humans must acquire at least ten fungal spores on a [[keratin]] rich surface in order to acquire an infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally of the mating types, the positive strain is more pathogenic then the negative strain.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Identification is usually classified on the appearance of the fungus on the host via a sample culture.<ref name=howard2003 /> Both ''M. gypseum'' and ''[[M. fulvum]]'' have been commonly isolated from patients with human infections of the disease.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Human to human transmission is known to occur.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=versalovic/>

''Microsporum gypseum'' is categorized as a rare agent of infection, and usually only occurs in rural areas.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=Romano /> The infections associated with hair can also be prone to fluorescence under a [[Black light#Clinical use|Wood's Lamp]].<ref name=rippon1988 /> Sometimes these clinical manifestations are not ringworm but appear as impetigo, scleroderma or psoriasis.<ref name=Romano2 /> The lesions are usually inflammatory, [[impetiginous]], and sometimes bullous with rapid development and resolution; this is accompanied by scarring and permanent patches [[alopecia]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The greatest intensity of inflammation is at the advancing margin of the ring.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Direct examination with KOH of skin, reveal [[mycelium]] and masses of [[arthroconidia]] in some chains; KOH examination of hair produces distinctive large [[macroconidia]] in chain or irregular masses of hair. Mycelium was also discovered to run parallel to its length.<ref name=kane1997 /> Wood's lamp tests on humans indicate the fungus by fluorescence.<ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus is encountered rarely as a confirmed agent of [[onychomycosis]] in which the infection is validated by both a direct observation of filaments in the nail and recovery of the fungus in culture.<ref name=Romano /><ref name=Romano2 />

==Pathogenicity==
[[File:TEV protease summary.png|thumb|250px|Example of a protease ([[TEV protease]]) complex]]
The pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the fungi are due to either the presence of substances on the surface of the fungi, or substances released by the fungi.<ref name=singforme/> These can include: surface [[Fungal adhesin|adhesin]]s, [[Mannan (polysaccharide)|mannan]]s, enzymes such as [[proteinases]], [[peptidase]]s, [[DNase]]s, and [[lipase]]s.<ref name=singforme/> The extracellular proteases released assist the fungus in invading the host skin barrier (keratin rich) with the presence of [[keratinase]] (keratinolytic activity increases).<ref name=singforme/> They then use the proteases to enhance their survival by chemically or physically altering the environment to their benefit by digesting the host proteins, thus providing themselves with nutrition. These [[protease]]s are found in all stages of growth (lag to declining) but peak at the mid log phase. These proteases are determined to be secreted during the lag phase of growth as they are secreted without the presence of host related proteins. It is assumed that the regulation and secretion of these enzymes is in part due to other differently regulated enzymes.<ref name=singforme/> Keratinolytic activity is also determined to be indicative of pathogenetic potential.<ref name=singforme/> Excessive exogenous carbohydrates such as glucose have been found to play a recessive role in protease release, as the presence of [[glucose]] decreases the amount of keratin hydrolyzed.<ref name=singforme/> The presence of hormones such as [[progesterone]] have also been seen to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of dermatophytes.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 />

==Treatment==
Therapy regarding deep fungal infections should be provided with [[amphotericin B]] therapy.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Oral [[ketoconazole]] with topical [[enilconazole]] has been found to help treat skin lesions.<ref name=nardoni /> Animal treatment is usually done with [[itraconazole]] or ketoconazole; most European countries use off label [[terbinafine]] in cats and dogs.<ref name=nardoni /> However the most common antifungal drug used for systemic use is [[griseofulvin]] because it is often the cheapest; treatment is usually on a common dose regimen of 50&nbsp;mg per kg every twelve to twenty four hours.<ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=nardoni /> Most of these administered drugs are variants of [[imidazole]]s. The treatment of [[onychomycosis]] involves the administration of itraconazole with systemic griseofulvin in combination with topical [[enilconazole]], sometimes a [[ciclopiroxolamine]] solution and systemic [[terbinafine]] is used.<ref name=romano3/> The mistreatment of fungal pathogens is due to the thought of bacterial infection and the administration of corticosteroids.<ref name=Romano2/> This causes a change in appearance of the lesion and can lead to a harder diagnosis. Mycological examination should form the basis of diagnosis before the administration of [[antibiotic]]s or [[corticosteroid]]s.<ref name=Romano2/>
