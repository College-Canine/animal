'''Sighthounds''' (also called '''gazehounds''') are a [[Dog type|type]] of [[hound]] [[dog]] that hunts primarily by sight and speed, unlike [[scent hound|scent hounds]], which rely on scent and endurance.

==Appearance==
[[File:Sighthound head.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]] head proportions of a typical sighthound]]

These dogs specialize in pursuing prey, keeping it in sight, and overpowering it by their great speed and agility. They must be able to detect motion quickly, so they have keen vision. Sighthounds must be able to capture fast, agile prey, such as [[deer]] and [[hare]]s, so they have a very flexible back and long legs for a long stride, a deep chest to support an unusually (compared to other dogs) large heart, very efficient lungs for both [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] and [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] sprints, and a lean, wiry body to keep their weight at a minimum. Sighthounds have unique anatomical and physiological features, likely due to intentional selection for hunting by speed and sight; laboratory studies have established reference intervals for [[hematology]] and serum biochemical profiles in sighthounds, some of which are shared by all sighthounds and some of which may be unique to one breed.<ref>"Clinical pathology of Greyhounds and other sighthounds" S. Zaldívar‐López L.M. Marín M.C. Iazbik N. Westendorf‐Stingle S. Hensley C.G. Couto ''Veterinary Clinical Pathology'' Volume 40, Issue 4, first published: 24 October 2011</ref>

The typical sighthound [[Dog type|type]] has a light, lean head, which is [[dolichocephalic]] in proportion. This shape can create the illusion that their heads are longer than usual. [[Gray wolf|Wolves]] and other [[Canidae|wild dog]]s are dolichocephalic or [[mesaticephalic]], but some [[Dog|domestic dog]]s have become [[brachycephalic]] (short-headed) due to [[artificial selection]] by humans over the course of 12,000 years.<ref name="Roberts">{{Citation |last1=Roberts |first1=Taryn |last2=McGreevy |first2=Paul |last3=Valenzuela |first3=Michael |date=July 2010 |title=Human Induced Rotation and Reorganization of the Brain of Domestic Dogs |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5 |issue=#7 |page=e11946 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011946 |pmid=20668685 |pmc=2909913|bibcode=2010PLoSO...511946R |doi-access=free }}</ref> Dolichocephalic dogs have a wider [[field of vision]] but smaller overlap between the eyes and therefore possibly poorer [[depth perception]] in some of their field of view than brachycephalic dogs; most, if not all, dogs have less visual acuity than their antecedent the wolf.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Miller |first1=Paul E. |last2=Murphy |first2=Christopher J. |date=December 15, 1995 |title=Vision in Dogs |url=http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/animal-eyes/dog-vision-miller-murphy.pdf |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=207 |issue=#12 |pages=1623–1634 |pmid=7493905 |access-date=2012-12-24}}</ref> There is no science-based evidence to confirm the popular belief that sighthounds have a higher visual acuity than other types of dogs.

==History==
Sighthounds such as the Saluki/Sloughi type (both named after the [[Seleucid Empire]]) may have existed for at least 5,000 years, with the earliest presumed sighthound remains of a male with a shoulder height around 54&nbsp;cm, compared to a Saluki, appearing in the excavations of [[Tell Brak]] dated approximately 4,000 years before present.<ref>Clutton-Brock, J., 1989. A dog and a donkey excavated at Tell Brak. ''Iraq'', 51, pp.217-224.</ref>  The earliest complete European description of a sighthound and its work, the Celtic ''vertragus''<ref>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Bronzen_beeldje_hazewindhond_ForumHadriani_015501_RMO_Leiden.jpg {{Bare URL image|date=March 2022}}</ref> from Roman Spain of the 2nd century C.E., comes from [[Arrian]]'s ''[[Cynegeticus]]''. 
A similar type, possibly a moderately sized male sighthound, with a height of 61–63&nbsp;cm, of approximately the same historic period, the ''Warmington Roman dog'' is described from a well-preserved skeleton found in England.<ref>Schoenebeck, J.J., Hamilton‐Dyer, S., Baxter, I.L., Schwarz, T. and Nussbaumer, M., (2021). From head to hind: Elucidating function through contrasting morphometrics of ancient and modern pedigree dogs. ‘’The Anatomical Record’’, 304(1), pp.63-77.  [https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ar.24412]</ref>
Sighthound type "gracile" bones, dating from the 8th to 9th century CE, anatomically defined as those of a 70 cm (28 in) high "greyhound", were genetically compared with the modern Greyhound and other sighthounds and found to be almost identical with the modern Greyhound breed, with the exception of only four deletions and one substitution in the DNA sequences, which were interpreted as differences probably arising from 11 centuries of breeding of this type of sighthound.<ref> SVOBODOVÁ, H., BARTOŠ, M., NÝVLTOVÁ FIŠÁKOVÁ, M. and KOUŘIL, P., (2015). Genetic analysis of possibly the oldest greyhound remains within the territory of the Czech Republic as a proof of a local elite presence at Chotěbuz-Podobora hillfort in the 8th–9th century AD. SbNM B, 71, pp.17-24.</ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miriam_Nyvltova_Fisakova/publication/283696817_Genetic_analysis_of_possibly_the_oldest_greyhound_remains_within_the_territory_of_the_Czech_Republic_as_a_proof_of_a_local_elite_presence_at_Hotebuz-Podobora_hillfort_in_t]
Population genomic analysis proposes that true sighthounds originated independently from native dogs and were comprehensively admixed among breeds, supporting the multiple origins hypothesis of sighthounds.<ref>Li, Wu-Lue, et al. "Multiple origins and genomic basis of complex traits in sighthounds". ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'' (2023): msad158.</ref>[https://watermark.silverchair.com/msad158.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW%20Ercy7Dm3ZL%209Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAtkwggLVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggLGMIICwgIBADCCArsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdmN7K9tNATkRjtg-AgEQgIICjB5iSTimqxtMUK%20RJ-mABGimVTeQEZxFdhXNzlXsPqwoFZC] 

Although today most sighthounds are kept primarily as [[pet]]s, some of them may have been bred for as many as thousands of years to detect movement of prey, then chase, capture, and kill it primarily by speed.  They thrive on physical activity. Some have mellow personalities, others are watchful or even hostile towards strangers, but the instinct to chase running animals remains strong.<ref name=fogle>{{cite book|last=Fogle|first=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Fogle|title=The Encyclopedia of the Dog|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=0-7513-0471-9|date=2000|orig-year=1995}}</ref>

Apart from [[coursing]] and [[hunting]], various dog sports are practiced with purebred sighthounds, and sometimes with [[lurcher]]s and [[longdog]]s. Such sports include [[Dog racing|racing]], [[lure coursing]], and other events.

== Breeds considered to be controversial, not having by origin a sighthound function ==
A number of breeds or types of dogs which do not hunt solely by speed and sight, as well as a number of non-hunting breeds, are currently being recognized as sighthounds, either formally or informally<ref>Bengtson, Bo. "How Many Sighthound Breeds? Would you believe more than 50?" ''Sighthound Review'' Vol. 5, Issue 4, Winter 2014–2015</ref> by kennel clubs, or lure and live coursing clubs. These include:

{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Andalusian Hound]]
* [[Basenji]]
* [[Cirneco dell'Etna]]
* [[Ibizan Hound]] (Podenco Ibicenco)
* [[Peruvian Inca Orchid]]
* [[Pharaoh Hound]] (Kelb tal-fenek)
* [[Podenco Canario]]
* [[Portuguese Podengo]]
* [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]]
* [[Thai Ridgeback]]{{div col end}}

==Kennel club classification==
When competing in [[conformation show]]s, most Anglophone [[kennel club]]s, including the [[American Kennel Club]] and [[The Kennel Club]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), group pedigree sighthound breeds together with [[scent hound]]s in a Hound Group,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/hound/ |title=Hound Group |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=American Kennel Club |access-date=24 December 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/Default.aspx?group=HDS |title=Hound |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=The Kennel Club |access-date=24 December 2019 }}</ref> the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] groups them in a dedicated Sighthound Group,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fci.be/en/nomenclature/10-Sighthounds.html |title=Group 10: Sighthounds |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Fédération Cynologique Internationale |access-date=24 December 2019 }}</ref> whilst the [[United Kennel Club]] groups them in a Sighthound and Pariah Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/breed-groups |title=Breed Group Designations |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=United Kennel Club |access-date=24 December 2019 }}</ref>
