'''Orchitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[testicle]]s.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000075643|orchitis}}</ref> It can also involve swelling, pains and frequent infection, particularly of the [[epididymis]], as in [[epididymitis]]. The term is from the Ancient Greek [[wikt:ὄρχις#Ancient Greek|ὄρχις]] meaning "testicle"; same root as ''[[orchid]]''.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s of orchitis are similar to those of [[testicular torsion]]. These can include:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* [[hematospermia]] (blood in the [[semen]])
* [[hematuria]] (blood in the [[urine]])
* severe [[pain]]
* visible [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of a testicle or testicles and often the inguinal lymph nodes on the affected side.

==Causes==
Orchitis can be related to [[epididymitis]] infection that has spread to the [[testicles]] (then called "epididymo-orchitis"), sometimes caused by the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]].  It has also been reported in cases of males infected with [[brucellosis]].<ref>''Brucellosis in Humans and Animals'' World Health Organization Publication number WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.7 [https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/Brucellosis.pdf]{{page needed|date=November 2014}}</ref> Orchitis can also be seen during active [[mumps]], particularly in adolescent boys.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

[[Ischemic]] orchitis may result from damage to the blood vessels of the [[spermatic cord]] during [[Hernia repair|inguinal herniorrhaphy]], and may in the worst event lead to [[testicular atrophy]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Simons MP, Aufenacker T, Bay-Nielsen M, etal |title=European Hernia Society guidelines on the treatment of inguinal hernia in adult patients |journal=Hernia |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=343–403 |date=August 2009  |pmid=19636493 |pmc=2719730 |doi=10.1007/s10029-009-0529-7}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasonography of orchitis.jpg|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasound]] of the scrotum, in the [[axial plane]], showing orchitis (as part of [[epididymo-orchitis]]) as [[hypoechogenic]] and slightly heterogenic left testicular tissue (right in image), with an increased blood flow. There is also swelling of peritesticular tissue.]]
* Blood – ESR high
* Urine – Cultural & Sensitivity test
* Ultrasound scanning

==Treatment==
In most cases where orchitis is caused by epididymitis, treatment is an oral antibiotic such as [[cefalexin]] or [[ciprofloxacin]] until infection clears up. In both causes [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] such as [[naproxen]] or [[ibuprofen]] are recommended to relieve pain. Sometimes stronger pain medications in the [[opiate]] category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced [[emergency department]] physicians.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Other animals ==
Orchitis is not rare in [[bull]]s and [[sheep|rams]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It has also been described in [[rooster]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Monleon R, Martin MP, John Barnes H |title=Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis in broiler breeders |journal=Avian Pathology |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=613–7 |date=December 2008  |pmid=19023758 |doi=10.1080/03079450802499134|s2cid=41011955 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
