'''Grout''' is a dense fluid that hardens used to fill gaps or as reinforcement in existing structures.<ref name=maconline>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maconline.org/tech/materials/grout.html |title=Not mortar, not concrete&mdash;grout! |publisher=Masonry Advisory Council |date=28 April 2015 |access-date=2015-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907161713/http://www.maconline.org/tech/materials/grout.html |archive-date=2015-09-07}}</ref>  Grout is generally a mixture of [[water]], [[cement]], and [[sand]], and is employed in [[pressure grouting]], embedding [[rebar]] in [[masonry]] walls, connecting sections of precast [[concrete]], filling voids, and sealing joints such as those between [[tile]]s. Common uses for grout in the household include filling in tiles of shower floors and kitchen tiles. It is often color tinted when it has to be kept visible and sometimes includes fine gravel when being used to fill large spaces (such as the cores of concrete blocks). Unlike other structural pastes such as [[plaster]] or [[joint compound]], correctly mixed and applied grout forms a water-resistant seal.
 
Although both grout and its close relative [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] are applied as a thick suspension and harden over time, grout is distinguished<ref name=beall1>{{cite book |last=Beall |first=Christine |title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders |year=1987 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-004223-0 |page=103}}</ref> by its low viscosity and lack of lime (added to mortar for pliability); grout is thin so it flows readily into gaps, while mortar is thick enough to support not only its own weight, but also that of masonry placed above it.<ref name=maconline/>

==Varieties==
Grout varieties include [[tile|tiling]], [[flooring]], [[resin]], [[non-shrink grout|nonshrinking]], structural, and [[thixotropy|thixotropic]] grouts.<ref name="Home Reference 2019">{{cite news |url=https://homereference.net/types-of-grout/ |title=Types of Grout: Picking the Right Grout for Your Project |work=Home Reference |date=2019 |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref> The use of enhancing admixtures increases the quality of cement-based materials and leads to greater uniformity of hardened properties.<ref name="Research Gate 2002">{{cite news |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285756799 |title=Influence of thixotropy on stability characteristics of cement grout and concrete |work=Research Gate |date=2002 |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref>
 
Tiling grout is often used to fill the spaces between tiles or mosaics and to secure tile to its base. Although ungrouted mosaics do exist, most have grout between the [[tesserae]]. Tiling grout is also cement-based, and is produced in sanded and unsanded varieties, which affects the strength, size, and appearance of the grout.<ref name="Portland Cement Association 1998">{{cite news |url=https://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/fc_mat-app_pdfs/masonry/is275-selecting-and-specifying-mortar-and-grout-for-unit-masonry.pdf |title=Selecting and Specifying Mortar and Grout for Unit Masonry |work=Portland Cement Association |date=1998 |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref> The sanded variety contains finely ground silica sand; unsanded is finer and produces a smoother final surface. They are often enhanced with polymers and/or [[latex]].<ref name="FCI Mag 2002-01-23">{{cite news |url=https://www.fcimag.com/articles/84093-polymer-thinsets-and-grout |title=Polymer Thinsets and Grout |work=FCI Mag |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref>
 
Structural grout is often used in reinforced masonry to fill voids in masonry housing reinforcing steel, securing the steel in place, and bonding it to the masonry.<ref name=beall1/> Nonshrinking grout is used beneath metal bearing plates to ensure a consistent bearing surface between the plate and its substrate, which adds stability and allows for higher load transfers.<ref name="Outpost Construction">{{cite web |url=https://www.outpostcs.com/informationcenter/resources/1107-grout-or-general-purpose-non-shrink-grout |title=Grout or General Purpose Non Shrink Grout |accessdate=2021-03-31 }}</ref>
 
[[Portland cement]] is the most common cementing agent in grout, but [[thermoset polymer matrix]] grouts based on [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]s such as [[Polyurethane|urethane]]s and [[epoxy|epoxies]] are also popular.<ref name=":0">DM Harrison, The Grouting Handbook, A Step-by-Step Guide for Foundation Design and Machinery Installation, Elsevier Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-12-416585-4}}</ref>
 
Portland cement-based grouts include different varieties depending on the particle size of the ground [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] used to make the cement, with a standard size around 15 [[micron]]s, microfine from 6&ndash;10 microns, and ultrafine below 5 microns. Finer particle sizes let the grout penetrate more deeply into a fissure. Because these grouts depend on the presence of sand for their basic strength, they are often somewhat gritty when finally cured and hardened. 
 
From the different types of grout, a suitable one has to be chosen depending on the load. For example, a load up to 7.5 tons can be expected for a garage access [two-component pavement joint mortar (traffic load)], whereas a cobbled garden path is only designed for a pedestrian load [one-component pavement joint mortar (pedestrian load)]. Furthermore, various substructures determine whether the type of grout should be permanently permeable to water or waterproof, for example, by concrete subfloor.

==Tools and treatments==
Tools associated with groutwork include:
*A '''grout saw''' or '''grout scraper''' is a manual tool for removal of old and discolored grout. The blade is usually composed of [[tungsten carbide]].
*A '''grout float''' is a [[trowel]]-like tool for smoothing the surface of a grout line, typically made of rubber or soft plastic
*'''Grout sealer''' is a water-based or solvent-based sealant applied over dried grout that resists water, oil, and acid-based contaminants.
*'''Grout cleaner''' is  a basic cleaning solution that is applied on grout lines and removes the dirt and dust.<ref name=":0" />
*A '''[[die grinder]]''' is used for faster removal of old grout compared to a standard grout saw.
*A '''pointing trowel''' is used for applying grout in flagstone and other stone works.
*A '''[[Multi-tool (power tool)|multi-tool (power tools)]]''' is another option for removing tile grout between tiles when fitted with a specified diamond blade.
*A '''grout clean-up bucket''' is a professional clean-up kit for faster grout washup. It consists of a specialised bucket on rollers with a sponge.
