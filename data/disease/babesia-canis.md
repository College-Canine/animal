'''''Babesia canis''''' is a [[parasite]] that infects red blood cells and can lead to [[anemia]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cornell University|title=Babesia Canis|url=https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/clinpath/modules/rbcmorph/b-canis.htm|publisher=Cornell}}</ref> This is a species that falls under the overarching genus ''[[Babesia]]''. It is transmitted by the brown dog tick (''[[Rhipicephalus sanguineus]]'') and is one of the most common [[piroplasm]] infections.<ref name="eadveterinaria">{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Peter|title=Canine Babesiosis|journal=Canine Babesiosis|page=1141|url=http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|access-date=2013-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211164109/http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> The brown dog tick is adapted to warmer climates and is found in both Europe and the United States, especially in shelters and greyhound kennels.<ref name="eadveterinaria" /><ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Halos | first1 = L. | last2 = Lebert | first2 = I. | last3 = Abrial | first3 = D. | last4 = Danlois | first4 = F. | last5 = Garzik | first5 = K. | last6 = Rodes | first6 = D. | last7 = Schillmeier | first7 = M. | last8 = Ducrot | first8 = C. | last9 = Guillot | first9 = J. | title = Questionnaire-based survey on the distribution and incidence of canine babesiosis in countries of Western Europe | journal = Parasite | volume = 21 | pages = 13 | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1051/parasite/2014015 | pmid = 24626325 | pmc = 3952654  }}</ref> In Europe, it is also transmitted by ''[[Dermacentor]]'' ticks with an increase in infections reported due to people traveling with their pets.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Peter|title=Canine Babesiosis|journal=Canine Babesiosis|page=1144|url=http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|access-date=2013-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211164109/http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Lifecycle ==
A tick carrying ''B. canis'' [[sporozoite]]s attaches to a dog, and feeds on its blood, releasing many sporozoites into the dog's bloodstream. Each sporozoite attaches to a red blood cell, and moves inside the cell. Once inside the cell, the sporozoite loses its outer coating. It divides, becoming a new form, known as a [[merozoite]].<ref name="marvistavet">{{cite web|last=Marvista Vet|title=Babesia Infection in Dogs|url=http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_babesia_infection_in_dogs.html|access-date=2013-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216223914/http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_babesia_infection_in_dogs.html|archive-date=2014-02-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> Inside the tick, the merozoite undergoes sexual reproduction ([[Apicomplexan life cycle#gametogony|gamogony]]), which is followed by asexual reproduction, resulting in many sporozoites. These are found in the tick salivary glands, and they move from there into the next dog on which the tick feeds.<ref name="capcvet">{{cite web|title=Babesia|url=http://www.capcvet.org/capc-recommendations/canine-babesiosis1/|work=Companion Animal Parasite Council|access-date=2013-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212114503/http://www.capcvet.org/capc-recommendations/canine-babesiosis1/|archive-date=2013-12-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pregnant dogs can transmit ''B. canis'' to their unborn puppies, so infected females should not be bred.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mierzejewska|first=Ewa J.|last2=Welc-Falęciak|first2=Renata|last3=Bednarska|first3=Małgorzata|last4=Rodo|first4=Anna|last5=Bajer|first5=Anna|date=2014|title=The first evidence for vertical transmission of Babesia canis in a litter of Central Asian Shepherd dogs|journal=Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine|volume=21|issue=3|pages=500–503|doi=10.5604/12321966.1120590|issn=1898-2263|pmid=25292117|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment ==
{{Main|Babesiosis}}
The clinical signs of ''B. canis'' infection are [[lethargy]], weakness, [[vomiting]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[fever]], pale [[mucous membrane]]s, and dark discoloration of the [[urine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Peter|title=Canine Babesiosis|journal=Canine Babesiosis|page=1146|url=http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|access-date=2013-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211164109/http://www.eadveterinaria.com.br/material/280/2214/Canine_Babesiosis.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other symptoms may present, including neurological and respiratory signs.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

''B. canis'' is not easy to diagnose on a [[blood smear]], since the chance of finding the parasite is low, due to its small size. Taking blood from a [[capillary]] source (such as a fresh cut) rather than from a blood vessel increases the chances of finding the organism.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Polymerase chain reaction]]  testing is a more accurate diagnostic method.<ref name="marvistavet" />

''B. canis'' infection in dogs usually responds to treatment with [[imidocarb dipropionate]], although the infection may not be eliminated and dogs can become permanent carriers.<ref name="capcvet" /> In dogs infected with ''B. canis'', [[splenectomy]] (removal of the spleen) or any [[immunosuppressive drug]] should be avoided; otherwise, signs of babesiosis may recur.<ref name="capcvet" />

== Prevention ==
[[Vaccine]]s to prevent ''B. canis'' are not available in North America,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} but in France, a vaccine is available, although it only seems effective against certain strains.<ref name="marvistavet" /> The best prevention is tick control, or prompt removal of ticks from the dog.<ref name="capcvet" /> The spread of ''B. canis'' by blood donation can be prevented by screening potential donor dogs for ''B. canis'' infection prior to their donation.<ref name="capcvet" />
