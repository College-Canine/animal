'''Trichiasis''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ɪ|k|i|ˈ|eɪ|s|ɪ|s}} {{respell|trik|ee|AY|sis}}, {{IPAc-en|t|r|ɪ|ˈ|k|aɪ|ə|s|ɪ|s}} {{respell|tri|KEYE|ə|sis}})<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/trichiasis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410143656/https://www.lexico.com/definition/trichiasis |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 10, 2021 |title = TRICHIASIS {{!}} Meaning & Definition for UK English {{!}} Lexico.com}}</ref> is a medical term for abnormally positioned [[eyelash]]es that grow back toward the eye, touching the [[cornea]] or [[conjunctiva]]. This can be caused by [[infection]], [[inflammation]], [[autoimmune]] conditions, congenital defects, eyelid [[agenesis]] and [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as burns or eyelid injury.

Standard treatment involves removal or destruction of the affected eyelashes with [[electrology]], specialized [[laser]], or [[surgery]].  In many cases, removal of the affected eyelashes with forceps resolves the symptoms, although the problem often recurs in a few weeks when the eyelashes regrow.  Severe cases may cause scarring of the cornea and lead to vision loss if untreated.  Mild cases may not require treatment.

Repeated cases of [[trachoma]] infection may cause trichiasis.<ref name="Rabiu">{{cite journal |vauthors= Rabiu M, Alhassan MB, ((Ejere HOD)), Evans JR |title= Environmental sanitary interventions for preventing active trachoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD004003 |date=2012 |issue= 2 |pmid= 22336798|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD004003.PUB4|pmc=4422499}}</ref>

Posterior misdirection of normal lashes most frequently affects the lower lid.

==In dogs==
Trichiasis in [[dog]]s is hair from the eyelid growing in the wrong direction and rubbing on the eye, causing irritation.  It usually occurs at the lateral upper eyelid, especially in the [[English Cocker Spaniel]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|editor=Gelatt, Kirk N.|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref>  Trichiasis also refers to hair from a nasal fold rubbing on the eye.  This type of trichiasis can be flattened by rubbing [[petroleum jelly]] onto it, but surgery is sometimes necessary for permanent correction.

==Complications==
* Inferior punctate epitheliopathy
* Corneal ulceration 
*[[Pannus]]
