'''Mineralocorticoids''' are a class of [[corticosteroid]]s, which in turn are a class of [[steroid hormone]]s. Mineralocorticoids are produced in the [[adrenal cortex]] and influence salt and water balances ([[Electrolyte#Physiological importance|electrolyte]] balance and [[fluid balance]]). The primary mineralocorticoid is [[aldosterone]].

==Physiology==
The name mineralocorticoid derives from early observations that these hormones were involved in the retention of [[sodium]], a [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral]]. The primary [[endogenous]] mineralocorticoid is [[aldosterone]], although a number of other endogenous hormones (including [[progesterone]]<ref name="pmid32305433">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker ME, Katsu Y | title = Progesterone: An enigmatic ligand for the mineralocorticoid receptor | journal = Biochem Pharmacol | volume = 177 | pages = 113976 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32305433 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113976 | s2cid = 216028937 | url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/72s6t6p0 | arxiv = 2001.07822 }}</ref> and [[deoxycorticosterone]]) have mineralocorticoid function.

Aldosterone acts on the kidneys to provide active reabsorption of sodium and an associated passive reabsorption of [[water]], as well as the active secretion of [[potassium]] in the principal cells of the cortical [[collecting tubule]] and active secretion of [[proton]]s via proton [[ATPase]]s in the lumenal membrane of the [[Collecting duct#Intercalated cells|intercalated cells]] of the [[collecting tubule]]. This in turn results in an increase of [[blood pressure]] and [[blood volume]].

Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the cortex of the [[adrenal gland]] and its secretion is mediated principally by [[angiotensin II]] but also by [[adrenocorticotrophic hormone]] (ACTH) and local [[potassium]] levels.

==Mode of action==
The effects of mineralocorticoids are mediated by slow genomic mechanisms through [[nuclear receptor]]s as well as by fast nongenomic mechanisms through membrane-associated receptors and [[signaling cascade]]s.

===Genomic mechanisms===
Mineralocorticoids bind to the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]] in the cell [[cytosol]], and are able to freely cross the [[lipid bilayer]] of the cell. This type of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] becomes activated upon [[ligand]] binding. After a hormone binds to the corresponding receptor, the newly formed [[Complex (chemistry)#Receptor-ligand complexes|receptor-ligand complex]] translocates into the [[cell nucleus]], where it binds to many [[hormone response element]]s (HREs) in the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region of the target [[gene]]s in the [[DNA]].

The opposite mechanism is called [[transrepression]]. The [[hormone receptor]] without ligand binding interacts with [[heat shock protein]]s and prevents the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of targeted genes.

Aldosterone and [[cortisol]] (a [[glucosteroid]]) have similar affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor; however, glucocorticoids circulate at roughly 100 times the level of mineralocorticoids. An enzyme exists in mineralocorticoid target tissues to prevent overstimulation by glucocorticoids. This enzyme, [[11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II]] ([[Protein:HSD11B2]]), catalyzes the deactivation of glucocorticoids to 11-dehydro metabolites. [[Licorice]] is known to be an inhibitor of this enzyme and chronic consumption can result in a condition known as [[pseudohyperaldosteronism]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3498851 | year = 2012 | last1 = Omar | first1 = HR | last2 = Komarova | first2 = I | last3 = El-Ghonemi | first3 = M | last4 = Fathy | first4 = A | last5 = Rashad | first5 = R | last6 = Abdelmalak | first6 = HD | last7 = Yerramadha | first7 = MR | last8 = Ali | first8 = Y | last9 = Helal | first9 = E | last10 = Camporesi | first10 = EM | title = Licorice abuse: Time to send a warning message | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 125–138 | doi = 10.1177/2042018812454322 | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism | pmid = 23185686}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Hyperaldosteronism]] (the syndrome caused by elevated aldosterone) is commonly caused by either idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia or by an [[adrenal adenoma]]. The two main resulting problems:

# [[Hypertension]] and [[edema]] due to excessive Na+ and water retention.
# Accelerated excretion of [[potassium|potassium ions]] (K+). With extreme K+ loss there is muscle weakness and eventually paralysis.

[[Hypoaldosteronism]] (the syndrome caused by underproduction of aldosterone) leads to the salt-wasting state associated with [[Addison's disease]], although classical [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and other disease states may also cause this situation.  Acute underproduction ([[hemorrhagic adrenalitis]]) is often life-threatening.

==Pharmacology==

An example of a synthetic mineralocorticoid is [[fludrocortisone]] (Florinef).

Important [[antimineralocorticoid]]s are [[spironolactone]] and [[eplerenone]].
