==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Histoplasmosis, due to the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum skin lesion 6840 lores.jpg|thumb|Skin lesion on the upper lip due to ''H. capsulatum'' infection]]
If symptoms of histoplasmosis infection occur, they start within 3 to 17 days after exposure; the typical time is 12–14 days. Most affected individuals have clinically silent manifestations and show no apparent ill effects. The [[Acute (medical)|acute]] phase of histoplasmosis is characterized by nonspecific respiratory symptoms, often cough or flu-like.

===Complications===
In absence of proper treatment and especially in [[immunocompromised]] individuals, complications can arise. These include recurrent pneumonia, [[respiratory failure]], fibrosing mediastinitis, [[superior vena cava syndrome]], pulmonary vessel obstruction, and progressive fibrosis of lymph nodes. Fibrosing mediastinitis is a serious complication and can be fatal. [[health effects of smoking|Smokers]] with structural [[lung disease]] have higher probability of developing chronic cavitary histoplasmosis.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

After healing of lesions, hard, calcified lymph nodes can erode the walls of the airway, causing [[hemoptysis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/hemoptysis/| title=Hemoptysis|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 24 July 2021}}</ref>

==Mechanisms==
''H. capsulatum'' grows in soil and material contaminated with bird or bat droppings ([[guano]]). The fungus has been found in poultry-house litter, caves, areas harboring bats, and bird roosts (particularly those of [[starling]]s). The fungus is [[Thermally dimorphic fungus|thermally dimorphic]]; in the environment, it grows as a brownish [[mycelium]], and at body temperature (37&nbsp;°C in humans), it morphs into a [[yeast]]. Histoplasmosis is not contagious but is contracted by inhalation of the spores from disturbed soil or guano.<ref name=Sherris/> The inoculum is represented principally by [[microconidia]]. These are inhaled and reach the alveoli. In the alveoli, macrophages ingest these microconidia. They survive inside the [[phagosome]]. As the fungus is thermally dimorphic, these microconidia are transformed into yeast. They grow and multiply inside the phagosome. The macrophages travel in lymphatic circulation and can spread the disease to different organs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/histoplasma-histoplasmosis/| title=Histoplasma/Histoplasmosis
|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 24 July 2021}}</ref>

Within the phagosome, the fungus has an absolute requirement for [[thiamine]].<ref>Garfoot AL, Zemska O, Rappleye CA (2013) ''Histoplasma capsulatum'' depends on ''de novo'' vitamin biosynthesis for intraphagosomal proliferation. Infect Immum</ref> Cell-mediated immunity for histoplasmosis develops within 2 weeks. If the patient has strong cellular immunity, macrophages, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes surround the organisms and contain them, and eventually calcify. In immunocompromised individuals, the organisms disseminate to different organs such as bone, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, and mucocutaneous membranes, resulting in [[progressive disseminated histoplasmosis]]. Chronic lung disease can manifest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/histoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20373495| title=Histoplasmosis|website=Mayo Clinic |access-date= 24 July 2021}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Chest X-ray acute pulmonary histoplasmosis PHIL 3954.jpg|thumb|[[Chest X-ray]] of a patient with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis]]
Clinically,  a wide spectrum of disease manifestations occurs, making diagnosis somewhat difficult. More severe forms include the chronic pulmonary form, often occurring in the presence of underlying pulmonary disease, and a disseminated form, which is characterized by the progressive spread of infection to extrapulmonary sites. Oral manifestations have been reported as the main complaint of the disseminated forms, leading the patient to seek treatment, whereas pulmonary symptoms in disseminated disease may be mild or even misinterpreted as flu.<ref>Brazão-Silva MT, Mancusi GW, Bazzoun FV, Ishisaaki GY, Marcucci M. A gingival manifestation of histoplasmosis leading diagnosis. Contemp Clin Dent. V.4 (1). 2013 (http://www.contempclindent.org/text.asp?2013/4/1/97/111621)</ref> Histoplasmosis can be diagnosed by samples containing the fungus taken from sputum (via [[bronchoalveolar lavage]]), blood, or infected organs.  It can also be diagnosed by detection of [[antigens]] in blood or urine samples by [[ELISA]] or [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Antigens can [[Cross-reactivity|cross-react]] with antigens of [[African histoplasmosis]] (caused by ''[[Histoplasma duboisii]]''), [[blastomycosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[paracoccidioidomycosis]], and [[talaromycosis]] infection. Histoplasmosis can also be diagnosed by a test for [[antibodies]] against ''Histoplasma'' in the blood.  ''Histoplasma'' skin tests indicate whether persons have been exposed, but do not indicate whether they have the disease.<ref name=Sherris/> Formal histoplasmosis diagnoses are often confirmed only by culturing the fungus directly.<ref name=Robbins/> [[Sabouraud agar]] is one agar growth medium on which the fungus can be cultured. Cutaneous manifestations of disseminated disease are diverse and often present as a nondescript rash with systemic complaints. Diagnosis is best established by urine antigen testing, as blood cultures may take up to 6 weeks for diagnostic growth to occur and serum antigen testing often comes back with a false negative before 4 weeks of disseminated infection.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg JD, Scheinfeld NS | title = Cutaneous histoplasmosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome | journal = Cutis | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–45 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14700213 }}</ref>

==Prevention==
Testing or decontaminating most sites that may be contaminated with ''H. capsulatum'' is impractical, but the sources below list environments where histoplasmosis is common, and precautions to reduce a person's risk of exposure, in the three parts of the world where the disease is prevalent. Precautions common to all geographical locations would be to avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Treatment==
In the majority of [[Immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] individuals, histoplasmosis resolves without any treatment. [[Antifungal medication]]s are used to treat severe cases of acute histoplasmosis and all cases of chronic and disseminated disease. Typical treatment of severe disease first involves treatment with [[amphotericin B]], followed by oral [[itraconazole]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheat LJ, Freifeld AG, Kleiman MB, Baddley JW, McKinsey DS, Loyd JE, Kauffman CA | title = Clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with histoplasmosis: 2007 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 45 | issue = 7 | pages = 807–25 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17806045 | doi = 10.1086/521259 | doi-access =  | s2cid = 7182568 }}</ref><ref>{{MerckHome|17|197|g||Histoplasmosis: Fungal Infections}}</ref>

Liposomal preparations of amphotericin B are more effective than deoxycholate preparations. The liposomal preparation is preferred in patients who might be at risk of nephrotoxicity, although all preparations of amphotericin B have risk of nephrotoxicity. Individuals taking amphotericin B are monitored for renal function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moen MD, Lyseng-Williamson KA, Scott LJ | s2cid = 34340503 | title = Liposomal amphotericin B: a review of its use as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia and in the treatment of invasive fungal infections | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19275278 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200969030-00010 }}</ref> Liposomal amphotericin B is better at treating people with progressive disseminated Histoplasmosis and underlying HIV when compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B.

Treatment with itraconazole must continue for at least a year in severe cases,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Barron MA, Madinger NE|title=Opportunistic Fungal Infections, Part 3: Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, and Emerging Mould Infections|journal=Infections in Medicine|date=November 18, 2008|url=http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1404367|access-date=July 15, 2009|archive-date=March 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314111604/http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1404367|url-status=dead}}</ref> while in acute pulmonary Histoplasmosis, 6 to 12 weeks treatment is sufficient. Alternatives to itraconazole are [[posaconazole]], [[voriconazole]], and [[fluconazole]]. Individuals taking itraconazole are monitored for hepatic function.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

== Prognosis ==
About 90% of patients with normal immune systems regain health without any intervention. Less than 5% need serious treatments.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Epidemiology==
''H. capsulatum'' is found throughout the world. It is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in certain areas of the United States, particularly in states bordering the [[Ohio River]] valley and the lower [[Mississippi River]]. The humidity and acidity patterns of soil are associated with endemicity. Bird and bat droppings in soil promote the growth of ''Histoplasma''. Contact with such soil aerosolizes the microconidia, which can infect humans. It is also common in caves in [[Southern Africa|Southern]] and [[East Africa]]. Positive histoplasmin skin tests occur in as many as 90% of the people living in areas where ''H. capsulatum'' is common, such as the eastern and central United States.<ref name=Sherris/>

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] advises that those who work in potentially hazardous environments reduce their exposure as much as possible following the [[Hierarchy of hazard controls]].<ref name=":1" /> They recommend that any build up of bird and bat droppings should be avoided if possible, but if it is unpreventable various engineering, administrative controls and [[personal protective equipment]] can be implemented in the workplace.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=HEALTH HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH BIRD AND BAT DROPPINGS |url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/public/hb/hbb&bdrp.htm |access-date=2023-12-04 |website=www.idph.state.il.us}}</ref> The CDC also suggests that workplaces should be responsible for administrative controls such as developing a safety plan, posting notice of the risk of exposure, disposing of any potentially contaminated materials, and providing proper education on the dangers associated with histoplasma.<ref name=":1" /> Adequate personal protective equipment includes a respirator, hooded coveralls, shoe coverings, gloves, and eye protection.<ref name=":2" />

==History==
''Histoplasma'' was discovered in 1905 by [[Samuel T. Darling]],<ref name=Darling1906>{{cite journal | vauthors=Darling ST| title=A protozoan general infection producing pseudotubercles in the lungs and focal necrosis in the liver, spleen and lymphnodes| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=46| issue=17| pages=1283–5| year=1906|url=http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/histmed/medica/cote?epo0215| doi=10.1001/jama.1906.62510440037003}}</ref> but only in the 1930s was it discovered to be a widespread infection. Before then, many cases of histoplasmosis were mistakenly attributed to tuberculosis, and patients were mistakenly admitted to tuberculosis sanatoria.  Some patients contracted tuberculosis in these sanatoriums.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Bennett JE, Dolin R, Blaser MJ | title = Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases | edition = 8th | date = 11 September 2014 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-1-4557-4801-3 }}</ref>
