'''Tetraethyllead''' (commonly styled '''tetraethyl lead'''), abbreviated '''TEL''', is an [[organolead compound]] with the formula [[lead|Pb]]([[ethyl group|C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>]])<sub>4</sub>. It was widely used as a [[fuel]] additive for much of the 20th century, first being mixed with [[gasoline]] beginning in the 1920s. This "leaded gasoline" had an increased [[octane rating]] that allowed [[Compression ratio|engine compression]] to be raised substantially and in turn increased vehicle performance and fuel economy.<ref name=BMJ1928>{{cite journal|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=3504|pages=366–7|date=3 March 1928|pmid=20773729|pmc=2455205|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.3504.366|title=Tetra-Ethyl Lead as an Addition to Petrol}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=After Lead?|work=[[Popular Science]]|page=94|edition=October 1987|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAAAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA94|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|date=October 1987}}</ref> TEL was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesised]] by German chemist [[Carl Jacob Löwig]] in 1853. American chemical engineer [[Thomas Midgley Jr.]], who was working for [[General Motors]], was the first to discover its effectiveness as an [[Engine knocking|antiknock]] agent in 1921, after spending several years attempting to find an [[antiknock agent|additive]] that was both highly effective and inexpensive.

In the mid-20th century, scientists discovered TEL caused [[lead poisoning]] and was toxic to the human brain, especially in children.<ref name="AMA_study=">{{Cite news |url=https://today.duke.edu/2017/03/lead-exposure-childhood-linked-lower-iq-lower-status |title=LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDHOOD LINKED TO LOWER IQ, LOWER STATUS: Leaded gasoline creates a natural experiment in long-term study |publisher=Duke University |date=28 March 2017 |accessdate=11 March 2022}}</ref> The [[United States]] and many other countries began phasing out the use of TEL in automotive fuel in the 1970s. By the early 2000s, most countries had completely banned the use of TEL in gasoline. Since 2011, leaded gasoline has been banned in every country on Earth. A 2011 study backed by the United Nations estimated that the removal of TEL had resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, and 1.2 million fewer premature deaths.<ref name=":1" />

Despite being banned from use in automotive fuel, TEL is sometimes still used in certain grades of [[Avgas|aviation fuel]].

This property, which allows it to dissolve so evenly and effectively in motor fuel, also allows it to dissolve oils and fats well, and therefore, diffuse through the blood–brain barrier and accumulate within the limbic forebrain, frontal cortex, and hippocampus.<ref name="Cadet & Bolla">{{cite journal |last1=Cadet |first1=J.

Despite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this process, which is rather difficult, involves metallic sodium, and converts only 25% of the lead to TEL. A related compound, [[tetramethyllead]], was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction.<ref name="Seyferth" /> A process with [[lithium]] was developed but never put into practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyferth |first1=Dietmar |title=The Rise and Fall of Tetraethyllead. 2 |journal=Organometallics |date=December 2003 |volume=22 |issue=25 |page=5174 |doi=10.1021/om030621b |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/om030621b |language=en |issn=0276-7333}}</ref>

== Reactions ==
A noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C–Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in [[internal combustion engine]]s, TEL decomposes completely into lead as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. Lead and lead oxide scavenge [[Radical (chemistry)|radical intermediates]] in [[combustion]] reactions. Engine knock is caused by a [[cool flame]], an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. Lead quenches the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front. Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and the ethyl groups serve as a gasoline-soluble carrier.<ref name="Seyferth" />

When TEL burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead and lead(II) oxide:<ref name=kloprogge826/>

{{block indent|{{chem2|2 Pb(C2H5)4 + 27 O2 -> 16 CO2 + 20 H2O + 2 PbO}}}}

Pb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and foul an engine. For this reason, [[1,2-dichloroethane]] and [[1,2-dibromoethane]] were also added to gasoline as lead scavengers—these agents form volatile [[lead(II) chloride]] and [[lead(II) bromide]], respectively, which flush the lead from the engine and into the air:<ref name=kloprogge826>{{cite book |last1=Kloprogge |first1=J.

== In motor fuel ==
TEL was extensively used as a [[gasoline additive]] beginning in the 1920s,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> wherein it served as an effective [[antiknock agent]] and reduced exhaust [[Poppet valve|valve]] and [[valve seat]] wear. Concerns were raised in reputable journals of likely health outcomes of fine particles of lead in the atmosphere.<ref name="Seyferth1">{{cite journal |last1=Seyferth |first1=Dietmar |title=The Rise and Fall of Tetraethyllead. 1.

=== Valve wear preventive ===
Tetraethyllead helps cool intake valves and is an excellent buffer against microwelds forming between exhaust valves and their [[Valve seat|seats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Master/291/page13.htm|title=1972 Imperial & Chrysler Engine Performance Facts & Fixes Service Book (Session 291)|website=Online Imperial Club}}</ref> Once these valves reopen, the microwelds pull apart and abrade the valves and seats, leading to valve recession. When TEL began to be phased out, the automotive industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded materials which allow for high wear resistance without requiring lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Master/302/page04.htm|title=1973 Imperial and Chrysler Clean Air System Reference Service Repair Book from the Master Technician's Service Conference (Session 302)|website=Online Imperial Club}}</ref>

=== Antiknock agent ===

TEL offered the business advantage of being commercially profitable because its use for this purpose could be patented.<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> Aviation fuels with TEL used in WWII reached octane ratings of 150 to enable turbocharged and supercharged engines such as the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]] to reach high horsepower ratings at altitude.<ref>{{cite book|title = I Kept No Diary|author = F.

In 1935 a licence to produce TEL was given to [[IG Farben]], enabling the newly formed German {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} to use high-octane gasoline. A company, Ethyl GmbH, was formed that produced TEL at two sites in Germany with a government contract from 10 June 1936.<ref>[[Rainer Karlsch]], Raymond G. Stokes. ''"Faktor Öl". Die Mineralölwirtschaft in Deutschland 1859–1974.'' C. H. Beck, München, 2003, {{ISBN|3-406-50276-8}}, p. 187.</ref>

In 1938 the United Kingdom [[Air Ministry]] contracted with [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] for the construction and operation of a TEL plant. A site was chosen at Holford Moss, near Plumley in Cheshire. Construction started in April 1939 and TEL was being produced by September 1940.<ref name="Plumley TEL Works">{{cite web |title=Northwich |url=https://www.octelamlwch.co.uk/northwich/ |website=Octel Bromine Works |access-date=9 January 2022}}</ref>

=== "Ethyl Fluid" ===
[[File:EthylCorporationSign.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on an antique gasoline pump advertising tetraethyllead by the [[Ethyl Corporation]]]]
For mixing with raw gasoline, TEL was most commonly supplied in the form of "Ethyl Fluid", which consisted of TEL blended with 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane. Ethyl Fluid also contained a reddish dye to distinguish treated from untreated gasoline and discourage the use of leaded gasoline for other purposes such as cleaning.<ref name="redrum">{{cite journal|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/om030621b|title=The Rise and Fall of Tetraethyllead|year=2003 |doi=10.1021/om030621b |last1=Seyferth |first1=Dietmar |journal=Organometallics |volume=22 |issue=25 |pages=5154–5178 }}</ref>

In the 1920s before safety procedures were strengthened, 17 workers for the [[Ethyl Corporation]], [[DuPont (1802–2017)|DuPont]], and [[Standard Oil]] died from the effects of exposure to lead.<ref name=Kovarik2005 />

Ethyl Fluid's formulation consisted of:<ref name="Seyferth" />
* 61.45% tetraethyllead
* 18.80% [[1,2-dichloroethane]]
* 17.85% [[1,2-dibromoethane]]
* 1.90% inerts and dyes

Dichloroethane and dibromoethane act in a synergistic manner, where equal or approximately equal quantities of both provide the best scavenging ability.<ref name="Seyferth" />

=== Phaseout and ban ===
In most industrialized countries, a phaseout of TEL from road vehicle fuels was completed by the early 2000s because of concerns over air and soil lead levels and the [[Bioaccumulation|accumulative]] neurotoxicity [[Lead poisoning|of lead]]. In the European Union, tetraethyllead has been classified as a [[Substance of Very High Concern]] and placed on the Candidate List for Authorisation under [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH).<ref>[https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/0b417b76-b533-42a1-9bd2-519f1dc1990d Inclusion of Substances of Very High Concern in the Candidate List – Decision of the European Chemicals Agency ED/169/2012]</ref> Potential use of TEL would need to be authorised through the [[REACH authorisation procedure]]. While not a complete ban, it introduces significant obligations such as a mandatory analysis of alternatives and socioeconomic analysis.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

The use of [[catalytic converter]]s, mandated in the United States for 1975 and later model-year cars to meet tighter emissions regulations, started a gradual phase-out of leaded gasoline in the U.S.<ref name=Kitman /> The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher-octane blending stocks such as [[reformate]] and [[iso-octane]] reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds such as [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) as well as [[oxygenate]]s including [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl tertiary-butyl ether]] (MTBE), [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|''tert''-amyl methyl ether]] (TAME), and [[Ethyl tert-butyl ether|ethyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (ETBE).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

The first country to completely ban leaded gasoline was [[Japan]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hofverberg |first1=Elin |title=The History of the Elimination of Leaded Gasoline |work=In Custodia Legis: Law Librarians of Congress |url=https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/04/the-history-of-the-elimination-of-leaded-gasoline/ |access-date=4 January 2023 |date=14 April 2022}}</ref>

Since January 1993 all gasoline powered cars sold in the [[European Union]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have been required to use unleaded fuel. This was to comply with the [[European emission standards|Euro 1 emission standards]] which mandated that all new cars to be fitted with a [[catalytic converter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Euro emissions standards |url=https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/fuels-environment/euro-emissions-standards |publisher=[[The AA]] |access-date=31 December 2022}}</ref> Unleaded fuel was first introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1986.<ref>{{cite news |title=Throwback Thursday 1989: the switchover to unleaded petrol |url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/throwback-thursday-1989-switchover-unleaded-petrol |access-date=31 December 2022 |work=Autocar |language=en}}</ref>

Leaded gasoline was removed from the forecourts in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2000, and a Lead Replacement Petrol was introduced although this was largely withdrawn by 2003 due to dwindling sales.<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Clark |title=Petrol for older cars about to disappear |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/aug/15/oil.business |work=The Guardian |date=15 August 2002 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Guide to lead replacement petrol (LRP) |publisher=The AA |url=https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/fuels-environment/lrp |access-date=1 January 2023}}</ref> An exemption to the ban exists for owners of classic cars.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Vehicles designed and built to run on leaded fuel often require modification to run on unleaded gasoline. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed to compensate for the relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of [[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder [[head gasket]]s and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons, although modern high-octane unleaded gasoline has eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

==== In motor racing ====
Leaded fuel was commonly used in professional [[motor racing]], until its phase out beginning in the 1990s. Since 1993, [[Formula One]] racing cars have been required to use fuel containing no more than 5&nbsp;mg/L of lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/regulation/category/110|title=FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations 2018 |date=7 December 2017}}</ref>{{verify inline|reason=Publication date was cited using an ambiguous date format. Might actually be 12 July|date=August 2023}}

[[NASCAR]] began experimentation in 1998 with an unleaded fuel, and in 2006 began switching the national series to unleaded fuel, completing the transition at the [[2007 Auto Club 500|Fontana round in February 2007]] when the premier class switched. This was influenced after blood tests of NASCAR teams revealed elevated blood lead levels.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= O'Neil |first1= J. |last2= Steele |first2= G. |last3= McNair |first3=C.

==== Aviation gasoline ====
{{Main|Avgas}}
TEL remains an ingredient of 100 [[octane rating|octane]] [[avgas]] for piston-engine aircraft. The current formulation of 100LL (low lead, blue) aviation gasoline contains {{convert|2.12|g/USgal|g/L}} of TEL, half the amount of the previous 100/130 (green) octane avgas (at 4.24 grams per gallon),<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/regulatory/reglead.html |title=Issues Related to Lead in Avgas |publisher= Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110918234831/http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/regulatory/reglead.html |archive-date= 18 September 2011|date= 2016-03-08}}</ref> and twice as much as the 1 gram per gallon permitted in regular automotive leaded gasoline prior to 1988 and substantially greater than the allowed 0.001 grams per gallon in automotive unleaded gasoline sold in the United States today.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.autofuelstc.com/autofuelstc/pa/Information.html |title= Modifications / Octane / Lead Content / Fuel Specs / Limitations / Certification |publisher= Petersen Aviation Inc. |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330200056/http://www.autofuelstc.com/autofuelstc/pa/Information.html |archive-date= 30 March 2012}}</ref> The United States Environmental Protection Agency, [[FAA]], and others are working on economically feasible replacements for leaded avgas, which still releases 100 tons of lead every year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.runwaygirlnetwork.com/2014/07/30/us-leads-avgas-effort-for-lead-free-air/ |title=US leads Avgas effort for lead-free air |last1=Bryan |first1=Chelsea |date=30 July 2014 |website=www.runwaygirlnetwork.com |publisher=Kirby Media Group |access-date=31 July 2014}}</ref>

==== Alternative antiknock agents ====
Antiknock agents are classed as ''high-percentage'' additives, such as alcohol, and ''low-percentage'' additives based on [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy elements]]. Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. [[Ferrocene]], an [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] compound of [[iron]], is also used as an antiknock agent although with some significant drawbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505193757/http://www.osd.org.tr/14.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Application of fuel additives|archive-date=5 May 2006}}</ref>

High-percentage additives are [[organic compound]]s that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20–30% for [[benzene]] and [[ethanol]]. It had been established by 1921 that ethanol was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons.<ref name="Kitman" /> [[Oxygenate]]s such as [[tert-Amyl methyl ether|TAME]] derived from natural gas, [[MTBE]] made from methanol, and ethanol-derived [[ETBE]], have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Improvements to gasoline itself decrease the need for antiknock additives. Synthetic [[iso-octane]] and [[alkylate]] are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatics]] can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of [[toxicity]] and [[carcinogen]]icity.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

== Toxicity ==
6&nbsp;mL of tetraethyllead is enough to induce severe [[lead poisoning]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+841 |title = TETRAETHYL LEAD - National Library of Medicine HSDB Database}}</ref> The hazards of TEL content are heightened due to the compound's volatility and high [[lipophilicity]], enabling it to easily cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].

=== Initial controversy ===
The toxicity of concentrated TEL was recognized early on, as lead had been recognized since the 19th century as a dangerous substance that could cause [[lead poisoning]]. In 1924, a public controversy arose over the "loony gas", after five<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/looney-gas-and-lead-poisoning-a-short-sad-history/|title=Looney Gas and Lead Poisoning: A Short, Sad History|first=Deborah|last=Blum|magazine=Wired|date=5 January 2013|via=www.wired.com}}</ref> workers died, and many others were severely injured, in Standard Oil refineries in New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40593353|title=Why did we use leaded petrol for so long?|last=Harford|first=Tim|date=2017-08-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-GB}}</ref> There had also been a private controversy for two years prior to this controversy; several public health experts, including [[Alice Hamilton]] and [[Yandell Henderson]], engaged Midgley and Kettering with letters warning of the dangers to public health.<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> After the death of the workers, dozens of newspapers reported on the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yarchive.net/chem/tetraethyl_lead.html|title=Tetraethyl lead (Bruce Hamilton)|website=yarchive.net}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' editorialized in 1924 that the deaths should not interfere with the production of more powerful fuel.<ref name=Kovarik2005 />

To settle the issue, the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] conducted a conference in 1925, and the sales of TEL were voluntarily suspended for one year to conduct a hazard assessment.<ref name=Seyferth /><ref name=Kitman /><ref>Alan P. Loeb, "Paradigms Lost: A Case Study Analysis of Models of Corporate Responsibility for the Environment," Business and Economic History, Vol. 28, No. 2, Winter 1999, at 95.</ref> The conference was initially expected to last for several days, but reportedly the conference decided that evaluating presentations on alternative anti-knock agents was not "its province", so it lasted a single day. Kettering and Midgley stated that no alternatives for anti-knocking were available, although private memos showed discussion of such agents. One commonly discussed agent was ethanol. The Public Health Service created a committee that reviewed a government-sponsored study of workers and an Ethyl lab test, and concluded that while leaded gasoline should not be banned, it should continue to be investigated.<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> The low concentrations present in gasoline and exhaust were not perceived as immediately dangerous. A [[U.S. Surgeon General]] committee issued a report in 1926 that concluded there was no real evidence that the sale of TEL was hazardous to human health but urged further study.<ref name=Kitman /> In the years that followed, research was heavily funded by the lead industry; in 1943, [[Randolph Byers]] found children with lead poisoning had behavior problems, but the [[Lead Industries Association]] threatened him with a lawsuit and the research ended.<ref name=Kovarik2005 /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Silbergeld |first=Ellen |author-link=Ellen Silbergeld |date=February 1995 |title=Annotation: Protection of the Public Interest, Allegations of Scientific Misconduct, and the Needleman Case |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=165–166 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.85.2.165 |pmid=7856774 |pmc=1615323 }}</ref>

In the late 1920s, [[Robert A. Kehoe]] of the [[University of Cincinnati]] was the Ethyl Corporation's chief medical consultant and one of the lead industry's staunchest advocates, who would not be discredited until decades later by Dr. [[Clair Cameron Patterson|Clair Patterson]]'s work on human lead burdens (see below) and other studies.<ref name=Kitman /> In 1928, Dr. Kehoe expressed the opinion that there was no basis for concluding that leaded fuels posed any health threat.<ref name="Kitman" /> He convinced the [[Hugh S. Cumming|Surgeon General]] that the [[dose–response relationship]] of lead had "no effect" below a certain threshold.<ref>Bryson, Christopher (2004). ''The Fluoride Deception'', p. 41. Seven Stories Press. Citing historian Lynne Snyder.</ref> As the head of Kettering Laboratories for many years, Kehoe would become a chief promoter of the safety of TEL, an influence that did not begin to wane until about the early 1960s. But by the 1970s, the general opinion of the safety of TEL would change, and by 1976 the U.S. government would begin to require the phaseout of this product.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Clair Cameron Patterson]] accidentally discovered the pollution caused by TEL in the environment while determining the [[age of the Earth]]. As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a [[cleanroom]] to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the Earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as [[Greenland]]. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective proponents of removing it from use.<ref>{{cite book |last = Bryson |first = B. |year = 2003 |chapter = 10.

===Modern findings===
In the 1970s, [[Herbert Needleman]] found that higher lead levels in children were correlated with decreased school performance. Needleman was repeatedly accused of scientific misconduct by individuals within the lead industry, but he was eventually cleared by a scientific advisory council.<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> Needleman also wrote the average US child's blood lead level was 13.7 μg/dL in 1976 and that Patterson believed that everyone was to some degree poisoned by TEL in gasoline.<ref name="Needleman1999">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1006/enrs.2000.4069 |pmid = 10991779 |title = The Removal of Lead from Gasoline: Historical and Personal Reflections |journal = Environmental Research |volume = 84 |issue = 1 |pages = 20–35 |year = 2000 |last1 = Needleman |first1 = H.|bibcode = 2000ER.....84...20N }}</ref>

In the U.S. in 1973, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, which therefore came to be known as the "lead phasedown" program. EPA's rules were issued under section 211 of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], as amended 1970. The Ethyl Corp challenged the EPA regulations in Federal court. Although the EPA's regulation was initially invalidated,<ref name=Kovarik2005 /> the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phasedown began to be implemented in 1976. Leaded gas was banned in vehicles with [[catalytic converters]] in 1975 due to damage of catalytic converters but it continued to be sold for vehicles without catalytic converters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gasoline and the environment - leaded gasoline - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/gasoline-and-the-environment-leaded-gasoline.php#:~:text=Because%20leaded%20gasoline%20damages%20catalytic,farm%20equipment%2C%20and%20marine%20engines. |website=www.eia.gov |access-date=23 June 2023}}</ref>  Additional regulatory changes were made by EPA over the next decade (including adoption of a trading market in "lead credits" in 1982 that became the precursor of the Acid Rain Allowance Market, adopted in 1990 for SO<sub>2</sub>), but the decisive rule was issued in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/fa6512c6e51c4a208525766200639df2/df94392f72ebb26085257746000aff52!OpenDocument |title=Lead Credit Trading |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=c. 2006 |website=National Center for Environmental Economics |publisher=US EPA |access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> The EPA mandated that lead additive be reduced by 91 percent by the end of 1986.

In Europe, Professor [[Derek Bryce-Smith]] was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/19/derek-bryce-smith-obituary|title=Derek Bryce-Smith obituary|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2011-07-19|last1=Gilbert|first1=Andrew}}</ref> 

From 1 January 1996, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]] banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles although that year the US EPA indicated that TEL could still be used in aircraft, racing cars, farm equipment, and marine engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/epa-takes-final-step-phaseout-leaded-gasoline.html |title=EPA Takes Final Step in Phaseout of Leaded Gasoline |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=29 January 1996 |website=US EPA Archive |publisher=US EPA |access-date=5 January 2020 |quote=Effective 1 January 1996, the Clean Air Act banned the sale of the small amount of leaded fuel that was still available in some parts of the country for use in on-road vehicles.

Taking cue from the domestic programs, the U.S. Agency for International Development undertook an initiative to reduce tetraethyl lead use in other countries, notably its efforts in Egypt begun in 1995. In 1996, with the cooperation of the U.S. AID, Egypt took almost all of the lead out of its gasoline. The success in Egypt provided a model for AID efforts worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Franchi |first=Valerie |date=October 1997 |title=Getting the Lead Out |url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACZ643.pdf |magazine=Front Lines |location=Washington, DC |publisher=USAID |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304012340/https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACZ643.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2017 |access-date=13 January 2024}}</ref>
