'''''Microsporum canis''''' is a [[pathogenic]], [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] fungus in the phylum [[Ascomycota]] that infects the upper, dead layers of skin on domesticated cats, and occasionally dogs and humans.<ref name=mycoses /><ref name=lab /> The species has a worldwide distribution.<ref name=medmyco />

==Taxonomy and evolution==
''Microsporum canis'' reproduces by means of two conidial forms, large, spindle-shaped, multicelled [[macroconidia]] and small, single-celled [[microconidia]].<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> First records of ''M. canis'' date to 1902.<ref name=bodin /> Evolutionary studies have established that ''M. canis'', like the very closely related sibling species ''M. distortum'' and ''M. equinum'', is a genetic clone derived from the sexually reproducing species, ''Arthroderma otae''.<ref name=evol /> Members of Ascomycota often possess conspicuous [[anamorph|asexual]] and [[teleomorph|sexual]] forms that can coexist in time and space. ''Microsporum canis'' exemplifies a common situation in ascomycetous fungi in which, over time, one mating type strain has undergone habitat divergence from the other and established a self-sustaining reproductive population that consists only of the asexual form.<ref name=medmyco /> It is hypothesized that asexual lineage of ''Microsporum canis'' evolved as a result of host-specific interactions, changes in ecological niche, as well as, geographic isolation of + and – mating types of ''Arthroderma otae'', hence making it difficult to sustain sexual reproduction.<ref name=evol /> Early domestication of animals, such as cats and dogs, in Africa led to a later evolution of host-specific fungus, ''Microsporum canis'', which is commonly associated with loose fur animals.<ref name=evol /> Nearly all reported isolates of ''Microsporum canis'' represent the "–" mating strain of ''A. otae''.<ref name=evol /><ref name=summerbell2002/> Together with two closely related taxa, ''M. ferrugineum'' and ''M. audouinii'', the clade is thought to have an African center of origin.<ref name=graser2006/>

==Morphology==

===Colony morphology===
''Microsporum canis'' forms a white, coarsely fluffy spreading colony with a distinctive "hairy" or "feathery" texture.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> On the underside of the growth medium, a characteristic deep yellow pigment develops due to the metabolites secreted by the fungus.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The intensity of this yellow pigmentation peak on the 6th day of colony growth and fades gradually making the identification of older colonies difficult.<ref name=derm /> Some strains of ''M. canis'' fail to produce yellow pigment altogether, exhibit abnormally slow colony growth and form undeveloped macroconidia.<ref name=derm /> Cultivation on polished rice tends to reestablish the typical growth morphology and is helpful for identification.<ref name=derm />

===Microscopic morphology===
''Microsporum canis'' reproduces asexually by forming macroconidia that are asymmetrical, spindle-shaped and have cell walls that are thick and coarsely roughened.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The interior portion of each macroconidium is typically divided into six or more compartments separated by broad cross-walls.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> ''Microsporum canis'' also produces microconidia that resemble those of many other dermatophytes and thus are not a useful diagnostic feature.<ref name=medmyco /><ref name=derm />

==Identification==
''Microsporum canis'' produces infections of scalp and body sites, creating highly inflammatory lesions associated with hair loss.<ref name=medmyco /> Infection by this species can often be detected clinically using Wood's lamp, which causes infected tissues to fluoresce bright green<ref name=derm /><ref name=mykosen /> Fluorescence is attributed to metabolite [[pteridine]], which is produced by the fungus in actively growing hairs.<ref name=medmyco /> Infected hairs remain fluorescent for prolonged periods of time (over the years), even after the death of the fungus.<ref name=medmyco /> Despite the frequent use of Wood's lamp in the clinical evaluation of ringworm infections, diagnosis of ''M. canis'' requires the performance of additional tests given the potential for false positives.<ref name=prev /> Culture of the fungus is most commonly used to evaluate morphological and physiological parameters of growth, and confirm the identity of the agent. Growth of the fungus on Sabouraud's agar (4% glucose), Mycosel or rice medium characteristically yields the bright yellow pigment. Microscopic examination of the growth can show the presence of the typical, warted and spindle-shaped [[macroconidia]], confirming the identity of the isolate as ''M. canis''.<ref name=infect /> The ''In vitro'' [[hair perforation test]], commonly used to differentiate many dermatophytes, is not particularly useful for this species as it reveals the formation of "pegs" that penetrate into hair shafts - a characteristic shared widely among many [[zoophilic]] species.<ref name=bodin /><ref name=identify /> Genetic analyses can be useful to establish the identity of atypical strains of ''M. canis''; however the highly characteristic appearance of this species generally obviates the need for this more sophisticated method.<ref name=mycoses /><ref name=jmm />

Most ''M. canis'' infections are caused by the "-" mating strain of its sexual progenitor, ''Arthroderma otae''.<ref name=medmyco />

''Microsporum canis'' has no specific growth factor or nutrition requirements, hence it grows well on most commercially available media.<ref name=bodin /> In addition, ''M. canis'' exhibits rapid colony growth at 25&nbsp;°C.<ref name=bodin /> Two growth media that help distinguish ''M. canis'' from other ''Microsporum'' spp. (notably the morphologically similar species, ''M. audouinii'') - specifically polished rice and potato dextrose agar.<ref name=derm /> On potato dextrose agar, ''M. canis'' produces a lemon-yellow pigment that is easily visualized, due to the presence of aerial hyphae, while on the polished rice, most isolates (even atypical strains) produce yellow pigment.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin />

==Pathophysiology==
It is considered a zoophilic dermatophyte, given that it typically colonizes the outer surface of animal's body.<ref name=derm /> Hence, animals, cats and dogs are believed to be the population hosts of this fungus, while humans are occasional hosts, in which the fungus can induce secondary infections.<ref name=derm /> ''Microsporum canis'' has been identified as a causal agent of a [[ringworm]] infection in pets, [[tinea capitis]] and [[tinea corporis]] in humans, children in particular.<ref name=lab /><ref name=medmyco /><ref name=bodin /><ref name=pmid19457268/><ref name=pmid15283801/>

''Microsporum canis'' is among the most common dermatophytes associated with tinea capitis and tinea corporis.<ref name=medmyco /><ref name=bodin /> Unlike some dermatophyte species, ''M. canis'' typically does not cause large epidemics. Humans become infected as a result of direct or indirect contact with infected pets.<ref name=mycoses /><ref name=lab /><ref name=medmyco /> ''Microsporum canis'' generally invades hair and skin; however, some nail infections have been reported.<ref name=medmyco /> When hair shafts are infected, ''M. canis'' causes an [[exothrix|ectothrix]]-type infection where the fungus envelopes the exterior of the hair shaft without the formation of internal spores.<ref name=derm/> This colonization of the hair shaft causes it to become unsheathed, resulting in characteristic round or oval non-inflammatory lesions the develop on the scalp.<ref name=derm/><ref name=mykosen /> Infection triggers an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] [[leukemoid reaction|leukocytic reaction]] in [[subcutaneous tissue]]s, which gradually becomes highly inflammatory and leads to hair loss, in the case of tinea capitis.<ref name=medmyco />

==Diagnosis==
Typically, infections caused by ''M. canis'' are associated with [[alopecia]] in the case of tinea capitis, while ringworm infections in pets produce characteristic inflammatory lesions, which may or may not result in hair loss.<ref name=medmyco /> This species has a propensity to cause subclinical infections in some animal species, particularly long-haired cats are frequent reservoirs of infection.<ref name=prev/> Isolation of the fungus from brushed pet hair can aid in detection of either an actively growing fungus or a passive carriage of fungal hyphae or arthroconidia.<ref name=prev/> In asymptomatic cases it is highly recommended to perform both Wood's lamp examination and microscopic analyses of suspected areas.<ref name=prev/> In the case of transient carriers, lack of clinical manifestations is accompanied with low number of ''M. canis'' colonies, number of which declines upon re-testing.<ref name=prev/>

==Treatment==
''Microsporum canis'' infections can be easily managed by topical antifungal agents; however severe cases may necessitate systemic therapy with [[griseofulvin]], [[itraconazole]] or [[terbinafine]].<ref name=mycoses /><ref name=mykosen /> Treatment of human cases also requires the identification and elimination of the infectious reservoir, which typically involves the investigation and treatment of colonized animals and the elimination of infected bedding and other environmental reservoirs.<ref name=prev />

==Habitat==
Despite its species name ("canis" implies dogs), the natural host of ''M. canis'' is the domestic cat. However this species can colonize dogs and horses as well. In all cases, it resides on the skin and fur.<ref name=prev /><ref name=jmm /> ''Microsporum canis'' may also persist as dormant spores in the environment for prolonged periods.<ref name=prev />

==Geographic distribution==
''Microsporum canis'' species have a worldwide distribution.<ref name=mycoses /><ref name=medmyco /> Extremely high occurrence has been reported in Iran, while lower incidence is associated with England and Scandinavian countries, as well as South American countries.<ref name=medmyco /> ''Microsporum canis'' is uncommon in some parts of US and Europe, and is completely absent from equatorial Africa.<ref name=derm />
