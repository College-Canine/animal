Other, noninvasive manifestations include fungal [[sinusitis]] (both [[allergy|allergic]] in nature and with established fungal balls), [[otomycosis]] (ear infection), [[keratitis]] (eye infection), and [[onychomycosis]] (nail infection). In most instances, these are less severe, and curable with effective [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] treatment.

The most frequently identified pathogens are ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'', ubiquitous organisms capable of living under extensive environmental stress.

== Signs and symptoms ==
A [[aspergilloma|fungus ball]] in the lungs may cause no symptoms and may be discovered only with a chest X-ray, or it may cause repeated [[hemoptysis|coughing up of blood]], chest pain, and occasionally severe, even fatal, bleeding.<ref name="Thornton2020"/> A rapidly invasive ''Aspergillus'' infection in the lungs often causes cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

Poorly controlled aspergillosis can disseminate through the blood to cause widespread organ damage.<ref name="Thornton2020"/> Symptoms include fever, chills, shock, delirium, seizures, and blood clots. The person may develop [[kidney failure]], [[liver failure]] (causing [[jaundice]]), and breathing difficulties.<ref name="Thornton2020"/> Death can occur quickly.

Aspergillosis of the ear canal causes itching and occasionally pain. Fluid draining overnight from the ear may leave a stain on the pillow. Aspergillosis of the sinuses causes a feeling of congestion and sometimes pain or discharge. It can extend beyond the sinuses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ederies A, Chen J, Aviv RI, Pirouzmand F, Bilbao JM, Thompson AL, Symons SP | title = Aspergillosis of the Petrous Apex and Meckel's Cave | journal = Skull Base | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 189–192 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 21318037 | pmc = 3037105 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1246229 }}</ref>

==Cause==
[[File:Aspergillus 235 mags 3X3 copy.jpeg|thumb|Aspergillus 235 mags 3X3 copy]]
Aspergillosis is caused by ''[[Aspergillus]]'', a common [[mold]], which tends to affect people who already have a lung disease such as [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[asthma]], or who [[immunodeficiency|cannot fight infection themselves]].<ref name="ICD-11"/> The most common causative species is ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.<ref name="Presterl1">{{cite book| vauthors = Willinger G | veditors = Presterl E |title=Clinically Relevant Mycoses: A Practical Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nSADwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-92299-7|pages=3–19|chapter=1.

=== Risk factors ===
People who are [[immunocompromised]] — such as patients undergoing [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], [[chemotherapy]] for [[leukaemia]], or [[AIDS]] — are at an increased risk for invasive aspergillosis infections. These people may have neutropenia or corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression as a result of medical treatments. [[Neutropenia]] is often caused by extremely [[cytotoxic]] medications such as cyclophosphamide. [[Cyclophosphamide]] interferes with cellular replication including that of white blood cells such as [[neutrophils]]. A decreased neutrophil count inhibits the ability of the body to mount [[immune responses]] against [[pathogens]]. Although [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-α) — a signaling molecule related to acute inflammation responses — is produced, the abnormally low number of neutrophils present in neutropenic patients leads to a depressed inflammatory response.
If the underlying neutropenia is not fixed, rapid and uncontrolled [[hyphal]] growth of the invasive fungi will occur and result in negative health outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dagenais TR, Keller NP | title = Pathogenesis of Aspergillus fumigatus in Invasive Aspergillosis | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 447–465 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19597008 | pmc = 2708386 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.00055-08 }}</ref> In addition to decreased neutrophil degranulation, the antiviral response against [[Flu]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]] viruses, mediated by type I and type II [[interferon]], is diminished jointly with the local antifungal immune response measured in the lungs of patients with IAPA (Influenza-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis) and CAPA ([[COVID-19|COVID-]]19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis).<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Feys S, Gonçalves SM, Khan M, Choi S, Boeckx B, Chatelain D, Cunha C, Debaveye Y, Hermans G, Hertoghs M, Humblet-Baron S, Jacobs C, Lagrou K, Marcelis L, Maizel J | display-authors = 6 |date= August 2022 |title=Lung epithelial and myeloid innate immunity in influenza-associated or COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis: an observational study |journal=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 12 |language=en |pages=1147–1159 |doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00259-4 | pmid = 36029799 |pmc=9401975}}</ref> COVID-19 patients with preexisting or newly diagnosed bronchiectasis are at particular risk of developing pulmonary aspergillosis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Baratella |first1=Elisa |last2=Roman-Pognuz |first2=Erik |last3=Zerbato |first3=Verena |last4=Minelli |first4=Pierluca |last5=Cavallaro |first5=Marco Francesco Maria |last6=Cova |first6=Maria Assunta |last7=Luzzati |first7=Roberto |last8=Lucangelo |first8=Umberto |last9=Sanson |first9=Gianfranco |last10=Friso |first10=Federica |last11=Bussani |first11=Rossana |last12=Pinamonti |first12=Maurizio |last13=Busetti |first13=Marina |last14=Salton |first14=Francesco |last15=Confalonieri |first15=Marco |date=2021-12-30 |title=Potential links between COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis and bronchiectasis as detected by high resolution computed tomography |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience-Landmark |language=en |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1607–1612 |doi=10.52586/5053 |issn=2768-6701|doi-access=free |pmid=34994174 |hdl=11368/3004919 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Normally the [[mucociliary clearance]] mechanism of the airways of the lungs removes inhaled particles. However, in those with underlying lung diseases, such as [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[bronchiectasis]], this mucociliary clearance mechanism is impaired and aspergillus spores (which are 2-5 μm in diameter) are able to colonize the airways and sinuses.<ref name="Thompson 2021" />

In hematologic patients with invasive aspergillosis, the [[galactomannan]] test can make the diagnosis in a noninvasive way. Galactomannan is a component of the fungal wall.<ref name="Thompson 2021" /> False-positive ''Aspergillus'' galactomannan tests have been found in patients on intravenous treatment with some antibiotics or fluids containing gluconate or citric acid such as some transfusion platelets, parenteral nutrition, or PlasmaLyte.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fortún J, Martín-Dávila P, Alvarez ME, Norman F, Sánchez-Sousa A, Gajate L, Bárcena R, Nuño SJ, Moreno S | display-authors = 6 | title = False-positive results of Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia in liver transplant recipients | journal = Transplantation | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–260 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19155981 | doi = 10.1097/TP.0b013e31819288d5 | s2cid = 40438193 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martín-Rabadán P, Gijón P, Alonso Fernández R, Ballesteros M, Anguita J, Bouza E | title = False-positive Aspergillus antigenemia due to blood product conditioning fluids | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = e22–e27 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22610929 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cis493 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In those with suspected pulmonary aspergillosis, [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] can be done to collect fluid from the airways of the lungs for analysis. This involves exploration of the airway with a [[bronchoscope]], then the introduction of a small amount of fluid into the airway which is then collected for analysis. This analysis can include assessment of cells, galactomannan testing, staining and fungal culture as well as [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) assessment.<ref name="Thompson 2021" /> PCR has an 85% sensitivity and 76% specificity for the diagnosis of aspergillosis, sensitivity is increased when the test is combined with galactomannan testing.<ref name="Thompson 2021" />

[[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]] (ABPA) is diagnosed by establishing an immune sensitization to aspergillosis, which can be done by measuring total [[eosinophils]], total [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) and aspergillus specific IgE and [[IgG]] levels. Elevations of these markers, combined with clinical and radiologic findings suggesting infection are used to confirm ABPA.<ref name="Thompson 2021" />

== Prevention ==

== Epidemiology ==
Aspergillosis is thought to affect more than  14 million people worldwide, with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) infecting about 4 million, severe asthma with fungal sensitization affecting about 6.5 million, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis infecting about 3 million people, considerably more than invasive aspergillosis which affects about 300,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bongomin F, Gago S, Oladele RO, Denning DW | title = Global and Multi-National Prevalence of Fungal Diseases-Estimate Precision | journal = Journal of Fungi | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 57 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29371573 | pmc = 5753159 | doi = 10.3390/jof3040057 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Other common conditions include [[Aspergillus bronchitis]], ''Aspergillus'' [[rhinosinusitis]], or [[otitis externa]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bongomin F, Batac CR, Richardson MD, Denning DW | title = A Review of Onychomycosis Due to Aspergillus Species | journal = Mycopathologia | volume = 183 | issue = 3 | pages = 485–493 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29147866 | pmc = 5958150 | doi = 10.1007/s11046-017-0222-9 }}</ref><ref name="AOUK">{{cite web |title=Aspergillus bronchitis {{!}} Aspergillus & Aspergillosis Website |url=https://www.aspergillus.org.uk/content/aspergillus-bronchitis |website=www.aspergillus.org.uk}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic 2020/21]], [[COVID-19]]-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was reported in some people who had been admitted to hospital and received longterm steroid treatment.<ref name="Machado">{{cite journal | vauthors = Machado M, Valerio M, Álvarez-Uría A, Olmedo M, Veintimilla C, Padilla B, De la Villa S, Guinea J, Escribano P, Ruiz-Serrano MJ, Reigadas E, Alonso R, Guerrero JE, Hortal J, Bouza E, Muñoz P | display-authors = 6 | title = Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the COVID-19 era: An expected new entity | journal = Mycoses | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 132–143 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33210776 | pmc = 7753705 | doi = 10.1111/myc.13213 }}</ref>

==Animals==
While relatively rare in humans, aspergillosis is a common and dangerous infection in birds, particularly in pet [[parrots]].  [[Mallard]]s and other ducks are particularly susceptible, as they often resort to poor food sources during bad weather. Captive raptors, such as falcons and hawks, are susceptible to this disease if they are kept in poor conditions and especially if they are fed pigeons, which are often carriers of "asper". It can be acute in chicks, but chronic in mature birds.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In the United States, aspergillosis has been the culprit in several rapid die-offs among waterfowl.  From 8 December until 14 December 2006, over 2,000 mallards died near [[Burley, Idaho]], an agricultural community about 150 miles southeast of [[Boise]].  Mouldy waste grain from the farmland and feedlots in the area is the suspected source.  A similar aspergillosis outbreak caused by mouldy grain killed 500 mallards in [[Iowa]] in 2005.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

While no connection has been found between aspergillosis and the H5N1 strain of [[avian influenza]] (commonly called "bird flu"), rapid die-offs caused by aspergillosis can spark fears of bird flu outbreaks.  Laboratory analysis is the only way to distinguish bird flu from aspergillosis.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In dogs, aspergillosis is an uncommon disease typically affecting only the nasal passages (nasal aspergillosis). This is much more common in [[Cephalic index#Dolichocephalic animals|dolicocephalic breeds]]. It can also spread to the rest of the body; this is termed disseminated aspergillosis and is rare, usually affecting individuals with underlying immune disorders.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In 2019, an outbreak of aspergillosis struck the rare [[kākāpō]], a large flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. By June the disease had killed seven of the birds, whose total population at the time was only 142 adults and 72 chicks. One fifth of the population was infected with the disease and the entire species was considered at risk of extinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/worlds-fattest-parrot-endangered-kakapo-fungal-infection-new-zealand|title=World's fattest parrot, the endangered kākāpō, could be wiped out by fungal infection| vauthors = Anderson C  |date=2019-06-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
