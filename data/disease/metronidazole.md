==Medical uses==
[[File:Metronidazole Aurobindo tube.jpg|left|thumb|A tube of metronidazole cream]]
Metronidazole has activity against some [[protozoan]]s and most [[anaerobic bacteria]] (both [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] classes) but not the [[aerobic bacteria]].<ref name="pmid9360057">{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman CD, Klutman NE, Lamp KC |title=Metronidazole. A therapeutic review and update |journal=Drugs |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=679–708 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9360057 |doi=10.2165/00003495-199754050-00003}}</ref><ref name="pmid20067388">{{cite journal |vauthors=Löfmark S, Edlund C, Nord CE |title=Metronidazole is still the drug of choice for treatment of anaerobic infections |journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume=50 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=S16–23 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20067388 |doi=10.1086/647939|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Metronidazole is primarily used to treat: [[bacterial vaginosis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (along with other antibacterials like [[ceftriaxone]]), [[pseudomembranous colitis]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[rosacea]] (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, [[lung abscess]], [[periodontal disease]], [[amoebiasis]], oral infections, [[giardiasis]], [[trichomoniasis]], and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as ''[[Bacteroides]], [[Fusobacterium]], [[Clostridium]], [[Peptostreptococcus]]'', and ''[[Prevotella]]'' species.<ref name = AMH/> It is also often used to eradicate ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.<ref name = AMH/>

Metronidazole is bitter and so the liquid suspension contains metronidazole benzoate. This may require [[hydrolysis]] in the gastrointestinal tract and some sources speculate that it may be unsuitable in people with diarrhea or feeding-tubes in the duodenum or jejunum.<ref name="Geoghegan-2017">{{cite web |url = https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/cpd-article/clostridium-difficile-diagnosis-and-treatment-update/20202242.cpdarticle |title = ''Clostridium difficile'': diagnosis and treatment update |publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society |vauthors = Geoghegan O, Eades C, Moore LS, Gilchrist M |work = The Pharmaceutical Journal |date = 9 February 2017 |access-date = 22 January 2018 |archive-date = 7 March 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190307054301/https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/cpd-article/clostridium-difficile-diagnosis-and-treatment-update/20202242.cpdarticle |url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="Dickman-2012">{{cite book |vauthors = Dickman A |title=Drugs in Palliative Care |date=2012 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-163610-3 |page=355 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSzs_8ijZpgC&pg=PA355 |access-date=29 August 2020 |archive-date=25 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220625064231/https://books.google.com/books?id=mSzs_8ijZpgC&pg=PA355 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Trichomoniasis===
The [[5-nitroimidazole]] drugs (metronidazole and [[tinidazole]]) are the mainstay of treatment for infection with ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient's sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic. Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower.<ref name="pmid9132982">{{cite journal |vauthors = duBouchet L, Spence MR, Rein MF, Danzig MR, McCormack WM |title = Multicenter comparison of clotrimazole vaginal tablets, oral metronidazole, and vaginal suppositories containing sulfanilamide, aminacrine hydrochloride, and allantoin in the treatment of symptomatic trichomoniasis |journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases |volume = 24 |issue = 3 |pages = 156–160 |date = March 1997 |pmid = 9132982 |doi = 10.1097/00007435-199703000-00006 |s2cid = 6617019 |doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Giardiasis===
Oral metronidazole is a treatment option for [[giardiasis]], however, the increasing incidence of [[nitroimidazole]] resistance is leading to the increased use of other compound classes.<ref name="pmid26258002">{{cite journal |vauthors = Leitsch D |title = Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite ''Giardia lamblia'' |journal = Current Tropical Medicine Reports |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 128–135 |date = September 2015 |pmid = 26258002 |pmc = 4523694 |doi = 10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 }}</ref>

===Dracunculus===
In the case of ''[[Dracunculus medinensis]]'' (Guinea worm), metronidazole just eases worm extraction rather than killing the worm.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

===''C. difficile'' colitis===
Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe ''[[Clostridioides difficile infection]]'' colitis ([[pseudomembranous colitis]]) consists of metronidazole, [[vancomycin]], or [[fidaxomicin]] by mouth.<ref name="pmid29462280"/> In 2017, the IDSA generally recommended vancomycin and fidaxomicin over metronidazole.<ref name="pmid29462280"/> Vancomycin [[Oral administration|by mouth]] has been shown to be more effective in treating people with severe ''C. difficile'' colitis.<ref name="pmid17599306">{{cite journal |vauthors = Zar FA, Bakkanagari SR, Moorthi KM, Davis MB |title = A comparison of vancomycin and metronidazole for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, stratified by disease severity |journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume = 45 |issue = 3 |pages = 302–307 |date = August 2007 |pmid = 17599306 |doi = 10.1086/519265 |title-link = doi |doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Preterm births===
Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent [[preterm birth]] associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole.<ref name="pmid16398774">{{cite journal |vauthors = Shennan A, Crawshaw S, Briley A, Hawken J, Seed P, Jones G, Poston L |title = A randomised controlled trial of metronidazole for the prevention of preterm birth in women positive for cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin: the PREMET Study |journal = BJOG |volume = 113 |issue = 1 |pages = 65–74 |date = January 2006 |pmid = 16398774 |doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00788.x |s2cid = 11366650 }}</ref>

===Hypoxic radiosensitizer===
In addition to its anti-biotic properties, attempts were also made to use a possible [[Radiosensitizer|radiation-sensitizing effect]] of metronidazole in the context of radiation therapy against [[Tumor hypoxia#Radiotherapy|hypoxic tumors]].<ref name="pmid6884824">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nori D, Cain JM, Hilaris BS, Jones WB, Lewis JL | title = Metronidazole as a radiosensitizer and high-dose radiation in advanced vulvovaginal malignancies, a pilot study | journal = Gynecologic Oncology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–28 | date = August 1983 | pmid = 6884824 | doi = 10.1016/0090-8258(83)90017-3 }}</ref> However, the neurotoxic side effects occurring at the required dosages have prevented the widespread use of metronidazole as an adjuvant agent in radiation therapy.<ref name="Sarna_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarna JR, Furtado S, Brownell AK | title = Neurologic complications of metronidazole | journal = The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 768–776 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24257215 | doi = 10.1017/s0317167100015870 }}</ref> However, other [[nitroimidazole]]s derived from metronidazole such as [[nimorazole]] with reduced electron affinity showed less serious neuronal side effects and have found their way into radio-onological practice for head and neck tumors in some countries.<ref name="Overgaard_1998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Overgaard J, Hansen HS, Overgaard M, Bastholt L, Berthelsen A, Specht L, Lindeløv B, Jørgensen K | title = A randomized double-blind phase III study of nimorazole as a hypoxic radiosensitizer of primary radiotherapy in supraglottic larynx and pharynx carcinoma.

=== Perioral dermatitis ===
''[[Canadian Family Physician]]'' has recommended topical metronidazole as a third-line treatment for the [[perioral dermatitis]] either along with or without oral [[tetracycline]] or oral [[erythromycin]] as first and second line treatment respectively.<ref name="pmid15856972">{{cite journal |vauthors = Cheung MJ, Taher M, Lauzon GJ |title = Acneiform facial eruptions: a problem for young women |journal = Canadian Family Physician |volume = 51 |pages = 527–533 |date = April 2005 |issue = 4 |pmid = 15856972 |pmc = 1472951 }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Hydroxymetronidazole.svg|thumb|[[Hydroxymetronidazole]], the main metabolite]]
Oral metronidazole is approximately 80% [[bioavailable]] via the gut and peak [[blood plasma]] concentrations occur after one to two hours. Food may slow down absorption but does not diminish it. Of the circulating substance, about 20% is bound to [[plasma protein]]s. It penetrates well into tissues, the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the [[amniotic fluid]] and breast milk, as well as into [[abscess]] cavities.<ref name="AC" />

About 60% of the metronidazole is [[metabolize]]d by [[oxidation]] to the main metabolite [[hydroxymetronidazole]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] derivative, and by [[glucuronidation]]. The metabolites show antibiotic and antiprotozoal activity ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref name="AC" /> Metronidazole and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys (77%) and to a lesser extent via the faeces (14%).<ref name = MSR/><ref name = MD/> The [[biological half-life]] of metronidazole in healthy adults is eight hours, in infants during the first two months of their lives about 23 hours, and in [[Preterm birth|premature]] babies up to 100 hours.<ref name="AC" />

==Research==
Metronidazole is researched for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Studies have shown that metronidazole can decrease the production of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) and [[nitric oxide]] by activated immune cells, such as [[macrophage]]s and [[neutrophil]]s. Metronidazole's [[Immunity (medical)|immunomodulatory]] properties are thought to be related to its ability to decrease the activation of [[nuclear factor-kappa B]] (NF-κB), a [[transcription factor]] that regulates the expression of [[Inflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory]] [[cytokine]]s, including [[chemokine]]s, and [[Cell adhesion molecule|adhesion molecules]].

Metronidazole has been studied in various immunological disorders, including [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[Periodontal disease|periodontitis]], and [[rosacea]].

==Veterinary use==
Metronidazole is used to treat infections of ''[[Giardia]]'' in dogs, cats, and other companion animals, but it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by [[fenbendazole]] for this purpose in dogs and cats.<ref name="pmid7978640">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barr SC, Bowman DD, Heller RL | title = Efficacy of fenbendazole against giardiasis in dogs | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 55 | issue = 7 | pages = 988–990 | date = July 1994 | doi = 10.2460/ajvr.1994.55.07.988 | pmid = 7978640 }}</ref> It is also used for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease in cats and dogs.<ref name="Hoskins-2001">{{cite news | vauthors = Hoskins JD | title = Advances in managing inflammatory bowel disease | date = 1 October 2001 | url = http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/dvm/Gastroenterology/Advances-in-managing-inflammatory-bowel-disease/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/3000 | newspaper = DVM Newsmagazine | access-date = 28 December 2013 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000212/http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/dvm/Gastroenterology/Advances-in-managing-inflammatory-bowel-disease/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/3000 | archive-date = 31 December 2013 }}</ref> Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal [[clostridia]]l infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) suggests it only be used when necessary because it has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as to prevent antimicrobial resistance.<ref name="Plumb-2008">{{cite book | vauthors = Plumb DC | title = Veterinary Drug Handbook | edition = 6th | publisher = Wiley | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-8138-2056-9 }}</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">{{cite web | title = Metronidazole | publisher = Drugs.com | url = https://www.drugs.com/pro/metronidazole.html | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130624052834/http://www.drugs.com/pro/metronidazole.html | archive-date = 24 June 2013 }}</ref>
