Florida keratopathy appears as multiple cloudy [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the [[stroma of cornea|stroma]]l layer of the cornea.<ref name="Roze" /> The spots appear concentrated at the center and become more diffuse at the periphery. They can range in size from one to eight millimeters.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N.

[[Histology|Histological]] analysis of affected corneas has found [[acid-fast]] staining organisms, suggesting Florida keratopathy may be caused by a type of [[mycobacterium]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999/> The disease may be induced by repeated stings to the eyes by the little fire ant, ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''.<ref>{{cite thesis | last = Theron | first = Leonard | title = ''Wasmannia auropunctata'' linked keratopathy Hypothesis - The Polynesian Case | work = Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine Master | year = 2005 | hdl = 2268/652}}</ref>{{Primary source-inline|date=April 2017}}
