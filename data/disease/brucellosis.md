The bacteria causing this disease, ''[[Brucella]]'', are small, [[Gram-negative]], nonmotile, nonspore-forming, rod-shaped ([[Coccobacillus|coccobacilli]]) bacteria. They function as [[Facultative parasite|facultative]] [[intracellular parasite]]s, causing [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic disease]], which usually persists for life. Four species infect humans: ''B. abortus'', ''B. canis'', ''B. melitensis'', and ''B. suis''. ''B. abortus'' is less virulent than ''B. melitensis'' and is primarily a disease of cattle. ''B. canis'' affects dogs. ''B. melitensis'' is the most virulent and invasive species; it usually infects goats and occasionally sheep. ''B. suis'' is of intermediate virulence and chiefly infects pigs. Symptoms include [[Diaphoresis|profuse sweating]] and [[Arthralgia|joint]] and [[Myalgia|muscle pain]]. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals and humans since the early 20th century.<ref>Park. K., Park’s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23 editions.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{More citations needed|section|date= January 2023}}
[[File:BrucellosisGraph.png|right|thumb|200px|A graph of the cases of brucellosis in humans in the United States from the years 1993–2010 surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System<ref>{{cite web |publisher=CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/resources/surveillance.html|title=Brucellosis: Resources: Surveillance|date=2018-10-09}}</ref>]]

The symptoms are like those associated with many other [[fever|febrile]] diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and night sweats. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.

In the first stage of the disease, [[bacteremia]] occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with a characteristic foul, moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory [[arthralgia]] and [[myalgia]] (joint and muscle pain).<ref>{{Citation |last1=Hayoun |first1=Michael A. |title=Brucellosis |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441831/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-11-08 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=28722861 |last2=Muco |first2=Erind |last3=Shorman |first3=Mahmoud}}</ref> Blood tests characteristically reveal a [[leukopenia|low number of white blood cells]] and [[anemia|red blood cells]], show some elevation of [[liver enzyme]]s such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]]<!-- (AST) --> and [[alanine aminotransferase]]<!-- (ALT) -->, and demonstrate positive Bengal rose and Huddleston reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70% of cases and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[decreased appetite]], unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[hepatomegaly|an enlarged liver]], [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]], [[liver abscess]], and [[splenomegaly|an enlarged spleen]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

This complex is, at least in Portugal, Israel, Syria, Iran, and Jordan, known as Malta fever. During episodes of Malta fever, melitococcemia (presence of brucellae in the blood) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium. If untreated, the disease can give origin to focalizations{{clarify|date=June 2020}} or become chronic. The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints, and [[osteomyelitis]] or [[spondylodiscitis]] of the lumbar spine accompanied by [[sacroiliitis]] is very characteristic of this disease. [[Orchitis]] is also common in men.

The consequences of ''Brucella'' infection are highly variable and may include [[arthritis]], [[spondylitis]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[meningitis]], [[uveitis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[endocarditis]], and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis.

==Cause==
[[Image:Brucella granuloma.jpg|thumb|[[Granuloma]] and [[necrosis]] in the liver of a guinea pig infected with ''Brucella suis'']]
Brucellosis in humans is usually associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses made from the milk of infected animals—often goats—infected with ''B. melitensis'', and with occupational exposure of laboratory workers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers. These infected animals may be healthy and asymptomatic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wyatt HV | title = How Themistocles Zammit found Malta Fever (brucellosis) to be transmitted by the milk of goats | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 98 | issue = 10 | pages = 451–4 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16199812 | pmc = 1240100 | doi = 10.1177/014107680509801009 | publisher = The Royal Society of Medicine Press | oclc = 680110952 }}</ref> Some vaccines used in livestock, most notably ''B. abortus'' strain 19, also cause disease in humans if accidentally injected. Brucellosis induces inconstant [[fever]]s, miscarriage, sweating, weakness, [[anemia]], [[headache]]s, [[clinical depression|depression]], and muscular and bodily pain. The other strains,  ''B. suis'' and ''B. canis'', cause infection in pigs and dogs, respectively.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Overall findings support that brucellosis poses an [[occupational safety and health|occupational risk]] to [[goat farmer]]s with specific areas of concern including weak awareness of disease [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] to humans and lack of knowledge on specific safe farm practices such as [[quarantine]] practices.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peck ME, Jenpanich C, Amonsin A, Bunpapong N, Chanachai K, Somrongthong R, Alexander BH, Bender JB | display-authors = 6 | title = Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Associated with Brucellosis among Small-Scale Goat Farmers in Thailand | journal = Journal of Agromedicine | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–63 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30350754 | doi = 10.1080/1059924X.2018.1538916 | s2cid = 53034163 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Coombs Gel Test.jpg|thumb|250px|Brucella Coombs Gel Test. Seropositivity detected to GN177]]
[[File:Rose Bengal Deneyi.jpg|thumb|250px|Rose Bengal Plate Test.]]
The diagnosis of brucellosis relies on:{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}
# Demonstration of the agent: blood cultures in tryptose broth, bone marrow cultures: The growth of brucellae is extremely slow (they can take up to two months to grow) and the culture poses a risk to laboratory personnel due to high infectivity of brucellae.
# Demonstration of antibodies against the agent either with the classic Huddleson, Wright, and/or Bengal Rose reactions, either with ELISA or the 2-mercaptoethanol assay for IgM antibodies associated with chronic disease
# Histologic evidence of granulomatous hepatitis on hepatic biopsy
# Radiologic alterations in infected vertebrae: the Pedro Pons sign (preferential erosion of the anterosuperior corner of lumbar vertebrae) and marked osteophytosis are suspicious of brucellic spondylitis.
Definite diagnosis of brucellosis requires the isolation of the organism from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, but serological methods may be the only tests available in many settings. Positive blood culture yield ranges between 40 and 70% and is less commonly positive for ''B. abortus'' than ''[[Brucella melitensis|B. melitensis]]'' or  ''B. suis''. Identification of specific [[antibodies]] against bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]] and other [[antigens]] can be detected by the standard agglutination test ([[Agglutination (biology)|SAT]]), rose Bengal, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), antihuman [[globulin]] (Coombs') and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]). SAT is the most commonly used [[serology]] in endemic areas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco MP, Mulder M, Gilman RH, Smits HL | title = Human brucellosis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 775–86 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18045560 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70286-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al Dahouk S, Nöckler K | title = Implications of laboratory diagnosis on brucellosis therapy | journal = Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = 833–45 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21810055 | doi = 10.1586/eri.11.55 | s2cid = 5068325 | doi-access = free }}</ref> An agglutination titre greater than 1:160 is considered significant in nonendemic areas and greater than 1:320 in endemic areas.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Due to the similarity of the O [[polysaccharide]] of ''Brucella'' to that of various other [[Gram-negative bacteria]] (e.g. ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella urbana]]'', ''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Stenotrophomonas maltophilia]]''), the appearance of cross-reactions of class M [[immunoglobulin]]s may occur. The inability to diagnose ''B. canis'' by SAT due to lack of cross-reaction is another drawback. False-negative SAT may be caused by the presence of blocking antibodies (the [[prozone phenomenon]]) in the α2-globulin (IgA) and in the α-globulin (IgG) fractions.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Dipstick assays are new and promising, based on the binding of ''Brucella'' IgM antibodies, and are simple, accurate, and rapid. ELISA typically uses cytoplasmic proteins as antigens. It measures IgM, IgG, and IgA with  better sensitivity and specificity than the SAT in most recent comparative studies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mantur B, Parande A, Amarnath S, Patil G, Walvekar R, Desai A, Parande M, Shinde R, Chandrashekar M, Patil S | display-authors = 6 | title = ELISA versus conventional methods of diagnosing endemic brucellosis | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 314–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20682874 | pmc = 2911177 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0790 }}</ref> The commercial Brucellacapt test, a single-step immunocapture assay for the detection of total anti-''Brucella'' antibodies, is an increasingly used adjunctive test when resources permit. [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] is fast and should be specific. Many varieties of PCR have been developed (e.g. nested PCR, realtime PCR, and PCR-ELISA) and found to have superior specificity and sensitivity in detecting both primary infection and relapse after treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu WL, Nielsen K | title = Review of detection of Brucella spp. by polymerase chain reaction | journal = Croatian Medical Journal | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–13 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20718083 | pmc = 2931435 | doi = 10.3325/cmj.2010.51.306 }}</ref> Unfortunately, these are not standardized for routine use, and some centres have reported persistent PCR positivity after clinically successful treatment, fuelling the controversy about the existence of prolonged chronic brucellosis.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Other laboratory findings include normal peripheral white cell count, and occasional [[leucopenia]] with relative [[lymphocytosis]]. The serum biochemical profiles are commonly normal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vrioni G, Pappas G, Priavali E, Gartzonika C, Levidiotou S | title = An eternal microbe: Brucella DNA load persists for years after clinical cure | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 46 | issue = 12 | pages = e131-6 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18462106 | doi = 10.1086/588482 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Prevention==
Surveillance using serological tests, as well as tests on milk such as the milk ring test, can be used for screening and play an important role in campaigns to eliminate the disease. Also, individual animal testing both for trade and for disease-control purposes is practiced. In endemic areas, vaccination is often used to reduce the incidence of infection. An [[Brucellosis vaccine|animal vaccine]] is available that uses modified live bacteria. The [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] ''Manual of Diagnostic Test and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals'' provides detailed guidance on the production of vaccines. As the disease is closer to being eliminated, a test and eradication program is required to eliminate it.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The main way of preventing brucellosis is by using fastidious hygiene in producing raw milk products, or by [[pasteurization|pasteurizing]] all milk that is to be ingested by human beings, either in its unaltered form or as a derivative, such as [[cheese]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Another important aspect of Brucellosis prevention is public awareness. People in endemic areas demonstrated a high lack of knowledge and understanding of the disease and its causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Ning |last2=Zhou |first2=Hao |last3=Huang |first3=De-Sheng |last4=Guan |first4=Peng |date=May 2, 2023 |title=Brucellosis awareness and knowledge in communities worldwide: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 79 observational studies |journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=e0007366 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007366 |pmid=31048848 |pmc=6497230 |doi-access=free }}</ref> To combat this, the One Health concept has been proposed. One Health is a method for combining disciplines such as public health, veterinary services, and microbiology to bring awareness to the disease. However, the implementation of this method faces many challenges including economic, political, and social barriers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moriyón |first1=Ignacio |last2=Blasco |first2=José María |last3=Letesson |first3=Jean Jacques |last4=De Massis |first4=Fabrizio |last5=Moreno |first5=Edgardo |date=August 2023 |title=Brucellosis and One Health: Inherited and Future Challenges |journal=Microorganisms |language=en |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2070 |doi=10.3390/microorganisms11082070 |pmid=37630630 |pmc=10459711 |issn=2076-2607 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Antibiotic]]s such as [[tetracycline]]s, [[rifampicin]], and the [[aminoglycoside]]s [[streptomycin]] and [[gentamicin]] are effective against ''Brucella'' bacteria. However, the use of more than one antibiotic is needed for several weeks, because the bacteria incubate within [[cell (biology)|cells]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The gold standard treatment for adults is daily [[intramuscular injection]]s of streptomycin 1&nbsp;g for 14 days and oral [[doxycycline]] 100&nbsp;mg twice daily for 45 days (concurrently). Gentamicin 5&nbsp;mg/kg by intramuscular injection once daily for 7 days is an acceptable substitute when streptomycin is not available or contraindicated.<ref name="pmid16575723">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hasanjani Roushan MR, Mohraz M, Hajiahmadi M, Ramzani A, Valayati AA | title = Efficacy of gentamicin plus doxycycline versus streptomycin plus doxycycline in the treatment of brucellosis in humans | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 42 | issue = 8 | pages = 1075–80 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16575723 | doi = 10.1086/501359 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Another widely used regimen is doxycycline plus rifampicin twice daily for at least 6 weeks.

Doxycycline is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], but requires the addition of two other drugs to prevent relapse. [[Ciprofloxacin]] and co-trimoxazole therapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse. In brucellic [[endocarditis]], surgery is required for an optimal outcome. Even with optimal antibrucellic therapy, relapses still occur in 5 to 10% of patients with Malta fever.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Prognosis==
The mortality of the disease in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent cause of death was [[endocarditis]]. Recent advances in [[antibiotics]] and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other veterinary control methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs. Exposure of diagnostic laboratory personnel to ''Brucella'' organisms remains a problem in both endemic settings and when brucellosis is unknowingly imported by a patient.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yagupsky P, Baron EJ | title = Laboratory exposures to brucellae and implications for bioterrorism | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1180–5 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16102304 | pmc = 3320509 | doi = 10.3201/eid1108.041197 }}</ref> After appropriate risk assessment, staff with significant exposure should be offered postexposure prophylaxis and followed up serologically for 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Laboratory-acquired brucellosis--Indiana and Minnesota, 2006 | journal = MMWR.

==History==
[[File:The members of the Mediterranean Fever Commission. Wellcome L0022610.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Bruce (microbiologist)|David Bruce]] (centre), with members of the Mediterranean Fever Commission (Brucellosis)]]
[[File:Sir Temi Zammit laboratory.jpeg|thumb|300px|The lab in which Sir [[Themistocles Zammit]] and the Mediterranean Fever Commission carried out research about brucellosis from 1904 to 1906 is located within the [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]].]]

Brucellosis first came to the attention of [[United Kingdom|British]] medical officers in the 1850s in Malta during the [[Crimean War]], and was referred to as Malta Fever. [[Jeffery Allen Marston]] (1831–1911) described his own case of the disease in 1861. The causal relationship between organism and disease was first established in 1887 by [[David Bruce (microbiologist)|David Bruce]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Lise | chapter= Brucellosis |editor-last = Kiple | editor-first = Kenneth F. |title=The Cambridge World History of Human Disease |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year = 1993}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt2|synd|819|Brucellosis}} named after {{WhoNamedIt|doctor|871|Major-General Sir David Bruce}}</ref> Bruce considered the agent spherical and classified it as a [[coccus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1897, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[veterinarian]] [[Bernhard Lauritz Frederik Bang|Bernhard Bang]] isolated a [[bacillus (shape)|bacillus]] as the agent of heightened spontaneous abortion in cows, and the name "Bang's disease" was assigned to this condition. Bang considered the organism rod-shaped and classified it as a [[bacillus]]. At the time no one knew that this bacillus had anything to do with the causative agent of Malta fever.<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Alice |url=https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Evans%2C+Alice+C.+1963 |title=Dr. Alice C.

In the late 1910s, American bacteriologist [[Alice Catherine Evans|Alice C. Evans]] was studying the Bang bacillus and gradually realized that it was virtually indistinguishable from the Bruce coccus.<ref name="de_Kruif_1932">{{cite book | last = de Kruif | first = Paul |author-link=Paul de Kruif |chapter=Ch. 5 Evans: death in milk |title=Men Against Death |publisher=Harcourt, Brace  |location=New York |year=1932 |oclc=11210642 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IokwAAAAIAAJ&q=editions:IokwAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> The short-rod versus oblong-round morphologic borderline explained the leveling of the erstwhile bacillus/coccus distinction (that is, these "two" pathogens were not a coccus versus a bacillus but rather were one [[coccobacillus]]).<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> The Bang bacillus was already known to be [[enzootic]] in American dairy cattle, which showed itself in the regularity with which herds experienced contagious abortion.<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> Having made the discovery that the bacteria were certainly nearly identical and perhaps totally so, Evans then wondered why Malta fever was not widely diagnosed or reported in the United States.<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> She began to wonder whether many cases of vaguely defined febrile illnesses were in fact caused by the drinking of raw (unpasteurized) milk.<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> During the 1920s, this hypothesis was vindicated. Such illnesses ranged from undiagnosed and untreated gastrointestinal upset to misdiagnosed<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> febrile and painful versions, some even fatal. This advance in bacteriological science sparked extensive changes in the American dairy industry to improve [[food safety]]. The changes included making [[pasteurization]] standard and greatly tightening the standards of cleanliness in milkhouses on [[dairy farming|dairy farms]]. The expense prompted delay and skepticism in the industry,<ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/> but the new hygiene rules eventually became the norm. Although these measures have sometimes struck people as overdone in the decades since,  being unhygienic at milking time or in the milkhouse, or drinking raw milk, are not a safe alternative.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In the decades after Evans's work, this genus, which received the name ''[[Brucella]]'' in honor of Bruce, was found to contain several species with varying virulence. The name "brucellosis" gradually replaced the 19th-century names Mediterranean fever and Malta fever.<ref name = "Wyatt_2004">{{cite journal|journal=British Medical Journal|last=Wyatt|first=Harold Vivian |date=31 July 2004|title= Give A Disease A Bad Name|jstor=25468794|issn=0959-535X|oclc=198096808|volume=329|issue=7460|pages=272–278|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7460.272|pmc=498028}}</ref>

Neurobrucellosis, a neurological involvement in brucellosis, was first described in 1879. In the late 19th century, its symptoms were described in more detail by M.

===Biological warfare===
''Brucella'' species had been weaponized by several advanced countries by the mid-20th century. In 1954, ''B. suis'' became the first agent [[biological warfare|weaponized]] by the United States at its [[Pine Bluff Arsenal]] near [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. ''Brucella'' species survive well in aerosols and resist drying. ''Brucella'' and all other remaining biological weapons in the U.S. arsenal were destroyed in 1971–72 when the American offensive biological warfare  program was discontinued by order of President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Woods | first = Jon B. |title=USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook |url=http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |edition=6th |publisher=[[USAMRIID|U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases]] |location=Fort Detrick, Maryland |date=April 2005 |page=53 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609104204/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-09 }}</ref>

The experimental American bacteriological warfare program focused on three agents of the ''Brucella'' group:{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}
* [[Swine brucellosis|Porcine brucellosis]] (agent US)
* Bovine brucellosis (agent AA)
* Caprine brucellosis (agent AM)

Agent US was in advanced development by the end of [[World War II]]. When the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) wanted a biological warfare capability, the Chemical Corps offered Agent US in the [[M114 bomblet]], based on the four-pound bursting bomblet developed for spreading [[anthrax]] during World War II. Though the capability was developed, operational testing indicated the weapon was less than desirable, and the USAF designed it as an interim capability until it could eventually be replaced by a more effective biological weapon.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

The main drawback of using the M114 with Agent US was that it acted mainly as an incapacitating agent, whereas the USAF administration wanted weapons that were deadly. The stability of M114 in storage was too low to allow for storing it at forward air bases, and the logistical requirements to neutralize a target were far higher than originally planned. Ultimately, this would have required too much logistical support to be practical in the field.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Agents US and AA had a median infective dose of 500 organisms/person, and for Agent AM it was 300 organisms/person. The incubation time was believed to be about 2 weeks, with a duration of infection of several months. The lethality estimate was, based on epidemiological information, 1 to 2
per cent. Agent AM was believed to be a somewhat more virulent disease, with a fatality rate of 3 per cent being expected.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Other animals==
Species infecting domestic livestock are ''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' (cattle, bison, and elk), ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'' (dogs), ''[[Brucella melitensis|B. melitensis]]'' (goats and sheep), ''[[Brucella ovis|B. ovis]]'' (sheep), and ''[[Swine brucellosis|B. suis]]'' (caribou and pigs). ''Brucella'' species have also been isolated from several marine mammal species (cetaceans and pinnipeds).{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

===Cattle===
''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' is the principal cause of brucellosis in cattle. The bacteria are shed from an infected animal at or around the time of calving or [[Spontaneous abortion|abortion]]. Once exposed, the likelihood of an animal becoming infected is variable, depending on age, pregnancy status, and other intrinsic factors of the animal, as well as the number of bacteria to which the animal was exposed.<ref>Radostits, O.M., C.C. Gay, D.C. Blood, and K.W. Hinchcliff. (2000). ''Veterinary Medicine, A textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses''. Harcourt Publishers Limited, London, pp. 867–882. {{ISBN|0702027774}}.</ref> The most common clinical signs of cattle infected with ''B. abortus'' are high incidences of abortions, arthritic joints, and retained [[placenta]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The two main causes for spontaneous abortion in animals are [[erythritol]], which can promote infections in the fetus and placenta,{{clarify|date=July 2022}} and the lack of anti-''Brucella'' activity in the amniotic fluid. Males can also harbor the bacteria in their reproductive tracts, namely [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[ampulla of ductus deferens|ampullae]], [[testicle]]s, and [[epididymis]]es.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

===Dogs===
The causative agent of brucellosis in [[dog]]s, ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'', is transmitted to other dogs through breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Brucellosis can occur in humans who come in contact with infected aborted tissue or semen. The bacteria in dogs normally infect the genitals and [[lymphatic system]], but can also spread to the eyes, [[kidney]]s, and [[intervertebral disc]]s. Brucellosis in the intervertebral disc is one possible cause of [[discospondylitis]]. Symptoms of brucellosis in dogs include abortion in female dogs and  [[scrotum|scrotal]] inflammation and [[orchitis]] in males. Fever is uncommon. Infection of the eye can cause [[uveitis]], and infection of the intervertebral disc can cause pain or weakness. Blood testing of the dogs prior to breeding can prevent the spread of this disease. It is treated with antibiotics, as with humans, but it is difficult to cure.<ref name="Ettinger_1995">{{cite book| last1 = Ettinger | first1 = Stephen J | last2 = Feldman | first2 = Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

===Aquatic wildlife===
Brucellosis in cetaceans is caused by the bacterium ''[[Brucella ceti|B. ceti]]''. First discovered in the aborted fetus of a [[bottlenose dolphin]], the structure of ''B. ceti'' is similar to ''Brucella'' in land animals. ''B. ceti'' is commonly detected in two suborders of cetaceans, the [[Mysticeti]] and [[Odontoceti]]. The Mysticeti include four families of [[baleen whales]], filter-feeders, and the Odontoceti include two families of toothed cetaceans ranging from dolphins to sperm whales. ''B. ceti'' is believed to transfer from animal to animal through sexual intercourse, maternal feeding, aborted fetuses, placental issues, from mother to fetus, or through fish reservoirs. Brucellosis is a reproductive disease, so has an extreme negative impact on the population dynamics of a species. This becomes a greater issue when the already low population numbers of cetaceans are taken into consideration. ''B. ceti'' has been identified in four  of the 14 cetacean families, but the antibodies have been detected in seven of the families. This indicates that ''B. ceti'' is common amongst cetacean families and populations. Only a small percentage of exposed individuals become ill or die. However, particular species apparently are more likely to become infected by ''B. ceti''. The harbor porpoise, striped dolphin, white-sided dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, and common dolphin have the highest frequency of infection amongst odontocetes. In the mysticetes families, the northern minke whale is by far the most infected species. Dolphins and porpoises are more likely to be infected than cetaceans such as whales. With regard to sex and age biases, the infections do not seem influenced by the age or sex of an individual. Although fatal to cetaceans, ''B. ceti'' has a low infection rate for humans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzmán-Verri C, González-Barrientos R, Hernández-Mora G, Morales JA, Baquero-Calvo E, Chaves-Olarte E, Moreno E | title = Brucella ceti and brucellosis in cetaceans | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 2 | pages = 3 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22919595 | pmc = 3417395 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2012.00003 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Terrestrial wildlife ===
The disease in its various strains can infect multiple wildlife species, including elk (''Cervus canadensis''), bison (''Bison bison''), African buffalo (''Syncerus caffer''), European wild boar (''Sus scrofa''), caribou (''Rangifer tarandus''), moose (''Alces alces''), and marine mammals (see section on aquatic wildlife above).<ref name="Brucellosis at Threecolumn"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Godfroid J | title = Brucellosis in wildlife | journal = Revue Scientifique et Technique | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–86 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 11974615 | doi = 10.20506/rst.21.2.1333 | url = http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D514.PDF | access-date = 2016-10-07 | archive-date = 2015-06-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150606124753/http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D514.PDF | url-status = dead }}</ref> While some regions use vaccines to prevent the spread of brucellosis between infected and uninfected wildlife populations, no suitable brucellosis vaccine for terrestrial wildlife has been developed.<ref name="Godfroid Garin-Bastjui Blasco">{{cite journal | vauthors = Godfroid J, Garin-Bastuji B, Saegerman C, Blasco JM | title = Brucellosis in terrestrial wildlife | journal = Revue Scientifique et Technique | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–42 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23837363 | doi = 10.20506/rst.32.1.2180 | url = http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D12397.PDF | citeseerx = 10.1.1.1020.9652 | access-date = 2016-10-07 | archive-date = 2015-06-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150606122947/http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D12397.PDF | url-status = dead }}</ref> This gap in medicinal knowledge creates more pressure for management practices that reduce spread of the disease.<ref name="Godfroid Garin-Bastjui Blasco" />

Wild bison and elk in the greater [[Yellowstone]] area are the last remaining reservoir of ''B. abortus'' in the US. The recent transmission of brucellosis from elk back to cattle in Idaho and Wyoming illustrates how the area, as the last remaining reservoir in the United States, may adversely affect the livestock industry. Eliminating brucellosis from this area is a challenge, as many viewpoints exist on how to manage diseased wildlife. However, the [[Wyoming Game and Fish Department]] has recently begun to protect scavengers (particularly [[coyote]]s and [[red fox]]) on elk feedgrounds, because they act as sustainable, no-cost, biological control agents by removing infected elk fetuses quickly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cross PC, Maichak EJ, Brennan A, Scurlock BM, Henningsen J, Luikart G | title = An ecological perspective on Brucella abortus in the western United States | journal = Revue Scientifique et Technique | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–87 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23837367 | doi = 10.20506/rst.32.1.2184 | url = https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/upload/09cross7987.pdf }}</ref>

The National Elk Refuge in Jackson, Wyoming asserts that the intensity of the winter feeding program affects the spread of brucellosis more than the population size of elk and bison.<ref name="Brucellosis at Threecolumn">{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nwrs/threecolumn.aspx?id=2147512596|title=Brucellosis|year=2016|website=www.fws.gov|publisher=U.S. Fish &Wildlife Service|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009180947/https://www.fws.gov/nwrs/threecolumn.aspx?id=2147512596|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since concentrating animals around food plots accelerates spread of the disease, management strategies to reduce herd density and increase dispersion could limit its spread.<ref name="Brucellosis at Threecolumn" />

=== Effects on hunters ===
Hunters may be at additional risk for exposure to brucellosis due to increased contact with susceptible wildlife, including predators that may have fed on infected prey. Hunting dogs can also be at risk of infection.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/hunters.html CDC - Hunters Risks - Animals That Can Put Hunters at Risk]</ref> Exposure can occur through contact with open wounds or by directly inhaling the bacteria while cleaning game.<ref name="Brucellosis at the CDC">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/|title=CDC – Home – Brucellosis | year=2016|website=www.cdc.gov|publisher=Center for Disease Control|access-date=2016-10-03}}</ref> In some cases, consumption of undercooked game can result in exposure to the disease.<ref name="Brucellosis at the CDC" /> Hunters can limit exposure while cleaning game through the use of precautionary barriers, including gloves and masks, and by washing tools rigorously after use.<ref name="Godfroid Garin-Bastjui Blasco"/><ref name="Zoonoses at WHO">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/brucellosis/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309163454/http://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/brucellosis/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 9, 2005|title=Zoonoses – Brucellosis | year=2016|website=www.who.int/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=2016-10-03}}</ref> By ensuring that game is cooked thoroughly, hunters can protect themselves and others from ingesting the disease.<ref name="Brucellosis at the CDC" /> Hunters should refer to local game officials and health departments to determine the risk of brucellosis exposure in their immediate area and to learn more about actions to reduce or avoid exposure.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}
