<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
A '''cataract''' is a cloudy area in the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] of the [[eye]] that leads to a [[visual impairment|decrease in vision]] of the eye.<ref name="NIH2009" /><ref name=":0" /> Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes.<ref name="NIH2009" /> Symptoms may include faded colours, blurry or [[double vision]], halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and [[Nyctalopia|difficulty seeing at night]].<ref name="NIH2009">{{cite web |date=September 2009 |title=Facts About Cataract |url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524095805/https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts |archive-date=24 May 2015 |access-date=24 May 2015}}</ref> This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces.<ref name="Allen-2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen D, Vasavada A | title = Cataract and surgery for cataract | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7559 | pages = 128–132 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16840470 | pmc = 1502210 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7559.128 }}</ref> Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of [[Falling (accident)|falling]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name=Gim2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gimbel HV, Dardzhikova AA | title = Consequences of waiting for cataract surgery | journal = Current Opinion in Ophthalmology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21076306 | doi = 10.1097/icu.0b013e328341425d | s2cid = 205670956 }}</ref> Cataracts cause 51% of all cases of [[blindness]] and 33% of [[visual impairment]] worldwide.<ref name=WHO2014>{{cite web|title=Visual impairment and blindness Fact Sheet N°282|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/|access-date=23 May 2015|date=August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512062236/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/|archive-date=12 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=WHO2012Data>{{cite book|title=Global Data on Visual Impairments 2010|date=2012|publisher=WHO|page=6|url=https://www.who.int/blindness/GLOBALDATAFINALforweb.pdf?ua=1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331221058/http://www.who.int/blindness/GLOBALDATAFINALforweb.pdf?ua=1|archive-date=2015-03-31}}</ref>

<!-- Cause, mechanisms and diagnosis -->

Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with [[#Classification|nuclear sclerotic]] or [[#Classification|brunescent]] cataracts often notice a [[Vision loss|reduction of vision]]. Nuclear cataracts typically cause greater impairment of distance vision than of near vision. Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of [[Glare (vision)|glare]] as their major symptom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Posterior Supcapsular Cataract|work=Digital Reference of Ophthalmology|url=http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/lc1.htm|publisher=Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology of Columbia University|year=2003|access-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327142432/http://dro.hs.columbia.edu/lc1.htm|archive-date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

The severity of cataract formation, assuming no other eye disease is present, is judged primarily by a [[visual acuity]] test. Other symptoms include frequent changes of glasses and colored halos due to hydration of lens.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

[[Congenital cataract]]s can result in [[amblyopia]] if not treated in a timely manner.<ref name=Moh2019>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohammadpour M, Shaabani A, Sahraian A, Momenaei B, Tayebi F, Bayat R, Mirshahi R | title = Updates on managements of pediatric cataract | journal = Journal of Current Ophthalmology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 118–126 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31317088 | pmc = 6611931 | doi = 10.1016/j.joco.2018.11.005 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Causes ==

===Age===
Age is the most common cause of cataracts.<ref name=NIH2009/><ref name=WHOPri/> Lens proteins [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] and degrade over time, and this process is accelerated by diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[hypertension]]. Environmental factors, including toxins, radiation, and [[ultraviolet light]] have cumulative effects which are worsened by the loss of protective and restorative mechanisms due to alterations in gene expression and chemical processes within the eye.<ref name="yanoff">{{cite book | vauthors = Duker JS, Yanoff M |title=Ophthalmology |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-323-04332-8 }}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}</ref>

[[Oxidative stress]] associated with [[lipid peroxidation]] is an important pathogenic mechanism in cataract formation.<ref name="Hsueh2022">{{cite journal | doi=10.3390/ijms23031255 | doi-access=free | title=The Pathomechanism, Antioxidant Biomarkers, and Treatment of Oxidative Stress-Related Eye Diseases | date=2022 | last1=Hsueh | first1=Yi-Jen | last2=Chen | first2=Yen-Ning | last3=Tsao | first3=Yu-Ting | last4=Cheng | first4=Chao-Min | last5=Wu | first5=Wei-Chi | last6=Chen | first6=Hung-Chi | journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume=23 | issue=3 | page=1255 | pmid=35163178 | pmc=8835903 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye|first1=Ya Fatou|last1=Njie-Mbye|first2=Madhura|last2=Chitnis|first3=Catherine|last3=Opere|first4=Sunny|last4=Ohia|date=January 18, 2013|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=4|page=366 |doi=10.3389/fphys.2013.00366|doi-access=free |pmid=24379787 |pmc=3863722}}</ref>  Senile cataracts are associated with a decrease in [[antioxidant]] capacity in the lens.<ref name = Hsueh2022/>  An increase in oxidative stress in the lens or a decrease in the ability to remove [[reactive oxygen species]] can lead to the lens becoming more opaque.<ref name = Hsueh2022/>

===Trauma===
[[File:Rosette cataract.jpg|thumb|Post traumatic rosette cataract of a 60-year-old male]]
Blunt trauma causes swelling, thickening, and whitening of the lens fibers. While the swelling normally resolves with time, the white color may remain. In severe blunt trauma, or in injuries that penetrate the eye, the capsule in which the lens sits can be damaged. This damage allows fluid from other parts of the eye to rapidly enter the lens leading to swelling and then whitening, obstructing light from reaching the retina at the back of the eye. Cataracts may develop in 0.7 to 8.0% of cases following [[electrical injury|electrical injuries]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy SC | title = Electric cataract: a case report and review of the literature | journal = European Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–138 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10435427 | doi = 10.1177/112067219900900211 | s2cid = 45814684 }}</ref> Blunt trauma can also result in star- (stellate) or petal-shaped cataracts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ram J, Gupta R | title = Images in Clinical Medicine.

===Radiation===
Cataracts can arise as an effect of exposure to various types of radiation. X-rays, one form of [[Radiobiology|ionizing radiation]], may damage the DNA of lens cells.<ref name = "Lipman1988">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipman RM, Tripathi BJ, Tripathi RC | title = Cataracts induced by microwave and ionizing radiation | journal = Survey of Ophthalmology | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–210 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3068822 | doi = 10.1016/0039-6257(88)90088-4 }}</ref> Ultraviolet light, specifically [[UVB]], has also been shown to cause cataracts, and some evidence indicates sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sliney DH | title = UV radiation ocular exposure dosimetry | journal = Documenta Ophthalmologica. Advances in Ophthalmology | volume = 88 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 243–254 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7634993 | doi = 10.1007/bf01203678 | s2cid = 8242055 }}</ref> [[microwave#Effects on health|Microwave]]s, a type of [[nonionizing radiation]], may cause harm by denaturing protective enzymes (e.g., [[glutathione peroxidase]]), by oxidizing [[Cysteine|protein thiol]] groups (causing [[protein aggregation]]), or by damaging lens cells via thermoelastic expansion.<ref name = "Lipman1988" />  The protein coagulation caused by electric and heat injuries whitens the lens.<ref name="yanoff" /> This same process is what makes the clear albumen of an egg become white and opaque during cooking.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

===Genetics===
[[File:Chrismas tree cataract.jpg|thumb|Christmas tree cataract (diffuse illumination)]]
The genetic component is strong in the development of cataracts,<ref>{{citation |page=77 |chapter=Molecular Genetics of Cataract |title=Genetics in Ophthalmology |publisher=Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-8055-7578-2 | vauthors = Hejtmancik JF, Smaoui N }}</ref> most commonly through mechanisms that protect and maintain the lens. The presence of cataracts in childhood or early life can occasionally be due to a particular syndrome. Examples of  [[Chromosomal disorder|chromosome abnormalities]] associated with cataracts include [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]], [[cri-du-chat syndrome]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Patau's syndrome]], [[trisomy 18]] ([[Edward's syndrome]]), and [[Turner's syndrome]], and in the case of [[neurofibromatosis type 2]], [[juvenile cataract]] on one or both sides may be noted. Examples of [[single-gene disorder]] include [[Alport's syndrome]], [[Conradi's syndrome]], [[cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis]], [[myotonic dystrophy]], and [[oculocerebrorenal syndrome]] or [[Lowe syndrome]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

===Skin diseases===
The skin and the lens have the same embryological origin and so can be affected by similar diseases.<ref>{{citation |page=507 |title=Ophthalmology | vauthors = Yanoff M, Duker JS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-323-04332-8}}</ref> Those with [[atopic dermatitis]] and [[eczema]] occasionally develop shield ulcer cataracts. [[Ichthyosis]] is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. [[Nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome|Basal-cell nevus]] and [[pemphigus]] have similar associations.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Smoking and alcohol===

[[Tobacco smoking|Cigarette smoking]] has been shown to increase the risk of age-related cataract and nuclear cataract.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2012|author=Ye J, He J, Wang C, Wu H, Shi X, Zhang H, Xie J, Lee SY.|title=Smoking and risk of age-related cataract: a meta-analysis|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|volume=53|issue=7|pages=3885–3895|doi=10.1167/iovs.12-9820|pmid=22599585}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=2019|author=Beltrán-Zambrano E, García-Lozada D, Ibáñez-Pinilla E.|title= Risk of cataract in smokers: A meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol (Engl Ed)|volume=94|issue=2|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.oftal.2018.10.020|pmid=30528895|s2cid=155984835 }}</ref> Evidence is conflicting over the effect of alcohol.

===Hyperbaric oxygen therapy===

[[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT) is the administration of 100% oxygen at pressures greater than one-atmosphere absolute pressure (1 ATA) for a therapeutic purpose. HBOT can have several side effects, including the long-term development of cataracts. This is rare and generally associated with multiple HBOT exposures over a long period. As it does not usually become symptomatic during HBOT, it may often go unrecognised and is probably under-reported. Evidence is emerging that lifetime dosage of oxygen may be a precipitating factor in the development of age-related cataracts. Nuclear cataracts have been hypothesized to be the end stage of the far better known phenomenon of hyperbaric myopic shift.<ref name="Bennett and Cooper 2022" >{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470454/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=StatPearls Publishing LLC. |title=Hyperbaric Cataracts |first1=Michael H.|last1=Bennett |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Cooper |date=10 August 2022 |pmid=29261974 |access-date=27 February 2023 }}</ref>

Cataracts may be partial or complete, stationary or progressive, hard or soft.  Histologically, the main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical, and posterior subcapsular.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Aliancy |first1=Joah F. |title=Crystalline Lens and Cataract |date=1995 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK476171/ |work=Webvision: The Organization of the Retina and Visual System |editor-last=Kolb |editor-first=Helga |access-date=2023-04-24 |place=Salt Lake City (UT) |publisher=University of Utah Health Sciences Center |pmid=29356473 |last2=Mamalis |first2=Nick |editor2-last=Fernandez |editor2-first=Eduardo |editor3-last=Nelson |editor3-first=Ralph}}</ref>

Nuclear sclerosis is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages, it is called a brunescent cataract. In early stages, an increase in sclerosis may cause an increase in refractive index of the lens.<ref name=Bollinger_2008/> This causes a myopic shift (lenticular shift) that decreases hyperopia and enables presbyopic patients to see at near without reading glasses. This is only temporary and is called second sight.<ref name="Academic Press">{{Citation |last1=Joo |first1=C. -K. |title=Posterior Subcapsular and Anterior Polar Cataract |date=2010-01-01 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Eye |pages=476–479 |editor-last=Dartt |editor-first=Darlene A. |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742032000403 |access-date=2024-02-20 |place=Oxford |publisher=Academic Press |doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-374203-2.00040-3 |isbn=978-0-12-374203-2 |last2=Choi |first2=J. -C. |last3=Kwan |first3=H. -G. |last4=Kim |first4=H.}}</ref>

Cortical cataracts are due to the lens cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in the periphery of the lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an [[ophthalmoscope]], or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.<ref name=Bollinger_2008>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bollinger KE, Langston RH | title = What can patients expect from cataract surgery? | journal = Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–96, 199–200 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18383928 | doi = 10.3949/ccjm.75.3.193 | s2cid = 27022598 }}</ref>

Posterior subcapsular cataracts are cloudy at the back of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.<ref name="Academic Press"/>

An immature cataract has some transparent protein, but with a mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes lamellar, polar, and sutural cataracts.<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RW, Andelman SY | title = Steroid cataracts.

Cataracts can be classified by using the lens opacities classification system LOCS III.  In this system, cataracts are classified based on type as nuclear, cortical, or posterior.  The cataracts are further classified based on severity on a scale from 1 to 5.  The LOCS III system is highly reproducible.<ref name=Yanoff_412>{{cite book| vauthors = Yanoff M, Duker JS  |title=Ophthalmology |year=2008 |publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-323-05751-6|edition=3rd|page=412}}</ref>

[[Phacoemulsification]] is the most widely used cataract surgery in the developed world.<ref>{{citation |title=Studies on the Cornea and Lens |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4939-1935-2 |page=4 | vauthors = Kim E, Yoon SY, Shin YJ }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Essential Principles of Phacoemulsification | vauthors = Pascal H |publisher=JP Medical Ltd |year=2013 |isbn=978-9962-678-61-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> This procedure uses ultrasonic energy to emulsify the cataract lens. Phacoemulsification typically comprises six steps:{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}
* Anaesthetic – The eye is numbed with either a subtenon injection around the eye (see: [[retrobulbar block]]) or topical anesthetic eye drops. The former also provides paralysis of the eye muscles.
* Corneal incision – Two cuts are made at the margin of the clear cornea to allow insertion of instruments into the eye.
* [[Capsulorhexis]] – A needle or small pair of forceps is used to create a circular hole in the capsule in which the lens sits.
* [[Phacoemulsification]] – A handheld ultrasonic probe is used to break up and emulsify the lens into liquid using the energy of ultrasound waves.  The resulting 'emulsion' is sucked away.
* Irrigation and aspiration – The cortex, which is the soft outer layer of the cataract, is aspirated or sucked away. Fluid removed is continually replaced with a saline solution to prevent collapse of the structure of the anterior chamber (the front part of the eye).
* Lens insertion – A plastic, foldable lens is inserted into the capsular bag that formerly contained the natural lens. Some surgeons also inject an antibiotic into the eye to reduce the risk of infection. The final step is to inject salt water into the corneal wounds to cause the area to swell and seal the incision.

A [[Cochrane review]] found little to no difference in visual acuity as a function of the size of incisions made for phacoemulsification in the range from ≤ 1.5&nbsp;mm to 3.0&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Jin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin C, Chen X, Law A, Kang Y, Wang X, Xu W, Yao K | title = Different-sized incisions for phacoemulsification in age-related cataract | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2017 | issue = 9 | pages = CD010510 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28931202 | pmc = 5665700 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010510.pub2 }}</ref> Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) consists of removing the lens manually, but leaving the majority of the capsule intact.<ref>{{citation |page=187 |chapter=Extracapsular Cataract Extraction |title=Essentials of Cataract Surgery | vauthors = Henderson B  |publisher=Slack |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55642-802-9}}</ref> The lens is expressed through a 10- to 12-mm incision which is closed with [[Surgical suture|sutures]] at the end of surgery. ECCE is less frequently performed than phacoemulsification, but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the [[sclera]] which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although "small", the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsification. This surgery is increasingly popular in the developing world where access to phacoemulsification is still limited.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Prognosis==

=== Postoperative care ===
[[File:Anterior capsular opacification.jpg|thumb|[[Slit lamp]] photo of anterior capsular opacification visible a few months after implantation of intraocular lens, magnified view]]
[[File:Africa Partnerships Vision 2020 2 (10665602364).jpg|thumb|A South African woman experiences newfound eyesight after a patch was removed after surgery to remove an eye cataract.]]
The postoperative recovery period (after removing the cataract) is usually short. The patient is usually ambulatory on the day of surgery, but is advised to move cautiously and avoid straining or heavy lifting for about a month. The eye is usually patched on the day of surgery and use of an eye shield at night is often suggested for several days after surgery.<ref name=vaughan />

In all types of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, known as an [[intraocular lens]], which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.<ref name="yanoff" />

===Complications===
{{main|Cataract surgery#Complications}}
Serious complications of cataract surgery include [[retinal detachment]] and [[endophthalmitis]].<ref>{{citation |page=247 |title=Applied Pathology for Ophthalmic Microsurgeons |publisher=Springer Science & Business |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-540-68366-7 |chapter=Complications After Cataract Surgery | veditors = Naumann GO, Holbach LM, Kruse FE }}</ref> In both cases, patients notice a sudden decrease in vision. In endophthalmitis, patients often describe pain. Retinal detachment frequently presents with unilateral [[visual field]] defects, blurring of vision, flashes of light, or floating spots.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

The risk of retinal detachment was estimated as about 0.4% within 5.5 years, corresponding to a 2.3-fold risk increase compared to naturally expected incidence, with older studies reporting a substantially higher risk. The incidence is increasing over time in a somewhat linear manner, and the risk increase lasts for at least 20 years after the procedure. Particular risk factors are younger age, male sex, longer axial length, and complications during surgery. In the highest risk group of patients, the incidence of pseudophakic retinal detachment may be as high as 20%.<ref name=Herrmann_2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrmann W, Helbig H, Heimann H | title = [Pseudophakic retinal detachment] | journal = Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde | volume = 228 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–200 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21374539 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1246116 | s2cid = 260192934 }}</ref>

The risk of endophthalmitis occurring after surgery is less than one in 1000.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Behndig A, Montan P, Stenevi U, Kugelberg M, Lundström M | title = One million cataract surgeries: Swedish National Cataract Register 1992–2009 | journal = Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 1539–1545 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21782099 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.05.021 }}</ref>

Corneal [[edema]] and cystoid macular edema are less serious but more common, and occur because of persistent swelling at the front of the eye in corneal edema or back of the eye in cystoid macular edema.<ref>{{citation |page=221 |title=Ophthalmology Secrets in Color | vauthors = Gault J, Vander J |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-323-37802-4}}</ref> They are normally the result of excessive inflammation following surgery, and in both cases, patients may notice blurred, foggy vision.

Posterior capsular opacification, also known as after-cataract, is a condition in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called 'posterior lens capsule opacification'. Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called [[Nd:YAG laser]] capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly to the bottom of the inside of the eye. This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina.

{{See also|Cataract surgery#History}}

Cataract surgery was first described by the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic physician]], [[Suśruta]] (about 5th century BCE) in ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' in [[ancient India]]. Most of the methods mentioned focus on hygiene. Follow-up treatments include bandaging of the eye and covering the eye with warm [[butter]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Goes FJ |title=The Eye in History |date=2013 |publisher=JP Medical Ltd |isbn=978-93-5090-274-5 |page=371 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0oL8xDJ0VEC&pg=PA371 |language=en}}</ref> References to cataracts and their treatment in [[Ancient Rome]] are also found in 29 AD in ''De Medicinae'', the work of the Latin encyclopedist [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]].<ref>{{cite book |ol=5225311W |title=De Medicinae | vauthors = Celsus AC, Collier GF  |year=1831}}</ref> Archaeological evidence of eye surgery in the Roman era also exists.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7194352.stm |title=The Romans carried out cataract ops |date=February 9, 2008 |work=BBC News | vauthors = Elliott J |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218050244/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7194352.stm |archive-date=February 18, 2008 }}</ref>

[[Galen]] of Pergamon (ca. 2nd century CE), a prominent [[Greece|Greek]] [[physician]], [[surgeon]] and [[philosopher]], performed an operation similar to modern cataract surgery. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1034789 | pages=85–87 | volume=7 | issue=1 | journal=Med Hist | title=Galen: On Anatomical Procedures: the Later Books | doi=10.1017/s002572730002799x| year=1963 | vauthors = Keele KD }}</ref>

[[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|Muslim ophthalmologist]] [[Ammar Al-Mawsili]], in his ''The Book of Choice in Ophthalmology'', written ''circa'' 1000 CE, wrote of his invention of a [[syringe]] and the technique of cataract extraction while [[experiment]]ing with it on a patient.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| vauthors = Stanley F |year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-514694-3|page=70}}</ref>

In 1468 [[Abiathar Crescas]], a [[Jewish]] physician and astrologer of the [[Crown of Aragon]], famously removed the cataracts of King [[John II of Aragon]], restoring his eyesight.

===Etymology===
"Cataract" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|cataracta}}'', meaning "waterfall", and from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|καταρράκτης}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|katarrhaktēs}}''), "down-rushing",<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkatarra%2Fkths |chapter=καταρράκτης |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405004553/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkatarra%2Fkths |archive-date=2012-04-05 |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |title-link=A Greek–English Lexicon |via=Perseus}}</ref> from καταράσσω (''katarassō'') meaning "to dash down"<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkatara%2Fssw |chapter=καταράσσω |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404220922/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkatara%2Fssw |archive-date=2012-04-04 |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |title-link=A Greek–English Lexicon |via=Perseus}}</ref> (from ''kata''-, "down"; ''arassein'', "to strike, dash").<ref name="DictionaryComCataract">{{cite web |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cataract |title=cataract |work=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="OxfordCataractArch">{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cataract |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008005743/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cataract |title=cataract |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |archive-date=8 October 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> As rapidly running water turns white, so the term may have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities.

==Research==
[[acetylcarnosine|N-Acetylcarnosine]] drops have been investigated as a medical treatment for cataracts.

[[Mode-locking|Femtosecond laser mode-locking]], used during cataract surgery, was originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in [[LASIK]] surgery, and has been introduced to cataract surgery.  The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle, and forceps, are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated three-dimensional images of the eyes can be used to guide lasers to make these incisions.  A [[Nd:YAG laser]] can also then break up the cataract as in phacoemulsification.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman NJ, Palanker DV, Schuele G, Andersen D, Marcellino G, Seibel BS, Batlle J, Feliz R, Talamo JH, Blumenkranz MS, Culbertson WW | title = Femtosecond laser capsulotomy | journal = Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery | volume = 37 | issue = 7 | pages = 1189–1198 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21700099 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.04.022 | s2cid = 3860204 }} [http://www.stanford.edu/~palanker/publications/fs%20capsulotomy%20JCRS%202011.pdf as PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914073521/http://www.stanford.edu/~palanker/publications/fs%20capsulotomy%20JCRS%202011.pdf |date=2012-09-14 }} The authors declare a financial interest in a company producing femtosecond laser equipment.</ref>
