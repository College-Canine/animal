'''Pulmonic stenosis''', is a dynamic or fixed obstruction of flow from the [[right ventricle]] of the heart to the [[pulmonary artery]]. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Empty section|date=November 2021}}

==Cause==
Pulmonic stenosis is usually due to isolated valvular obstruction ([[pulmonary valve stenosis]]), but it may be due to [[stenosis of pulmonary artery|subvalvular or supravalvular obstruction]], such as [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibular]] stenosis. It may occur in association with other [[congenital heart defect]]s as part of more complicated syndromes (for example, [[tetralogy of Fallot]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Pathophysiology==
When pulmonic stenosis (PS) is present, resistance to blood flow causes right ventricular hypertrophy. If right ventricular failure develops, right atrial pressure will increase, and this may result in a persistent opening of the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], shunting of unoxygenated blood from the right atrium into the left atrium, and systemic [[cyanosis]]. If pulmonary stenosis is severe, [[congestive heart failure]] occurs, and systemic venous engorgement will be noted. An associated defect such as a [[patent ductus arteriosus]] partially compensates for the obstruction by shunting blood from the left ventricle to the aorta then back to the pulmonary artery (as a result of the higher pressure in the left ventricle) and back into the lungs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice is [[percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty]] and is done when a resting [[peak gradient]] is seen to be >60mm Hg or a mean >40mm Hg is observed.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}
