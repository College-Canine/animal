== Normal cardiac conduction ==
The heart is a specialized muscle containing repeating units of [[Cardiac muscle|cardiomyocytes]], or heart muscle cells. Like most cells, cardiomyocytes maintain a highly regulated negative voltage at rest and are capable of propagating [[action potential]]s, much like neurons.<ref name="Loscalzo-2022">{{Cite book | vauthors = Loscalzo J, Keaney JF, MacRae CA |year=2022 |edition=21st |chapter=Basic Biology of the Cardiovascular System | veditors = Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson JL | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | publisher = McGraw Hill | isbn = 978-1-264-26850-4 }}</ref> While at rest, the negative cellular voltage of a cardiomyocyte can be raised above a certain threshold (so-called [[depolarization]]) by an incoming action potential, causing the myocyte to [[Myocardial contractility|contract]]. When these contractions occur in a coordinated fashion, the atria and ventricles of the heart will pump, delivering blood to the rest of the body.<ref name="Loscalzo-2022" />

Normally, the origination of the action potential causing cardiomyocyte contraction originates from the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node). This collection of specialized conduction tissue is located in the right atrium, near the entrance of the [[superior vena cava]].<ref name="Sauer-2022a">{{Cite book | vauthors = Sauer WH, Koplan BA, Zei PC |chapter=Principles of Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology | veditors = Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson JL |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2022 |edition=21st | isbn = 978-1-264-26850-4 }}</ref> The SA node contains pacemaker cells that demonstrate "automaticity" and can generate impulses that travel through the heart and create a steady heartbeat.<ref name="Sauer-2022a" />

At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the SA node generates an electrical action potential that spreads across the right and left [[Atrium (heart)|atria]], causing the atrial contraction of the [[cardiac cycle]].<ref name="Sauer-2022a" /> This electrical impulse carries on to the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node), another specialized grouping of cells located in the base of the right atrium, which is the only anatomically normal electrical connection between the atria and ventricles. Impulses coursing through the AV node are slowed before carrying on to the ventricles,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurian T, Ambrosi C, Hucker W, Fedorov VV, Efimov IR | title = Anatomy and electrophysiology of the human AV node | journal = Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 754–762 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20180918 | pmc = 2889145 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02699.x }}</ref> allowing for appropriate filling of the ventricles before contraction. The SA and AV nodes are both closely regulated by the autonomic nervous system's fibres, allowing for adjustment of cardiac output by the central nervous system in times of increased metabolic demand.

Following slowed conduction through the atrioventricular node, the action potential produced initially at the SA node now flows through the His-Purkinje system. The [[bundle of His]] originates in the AV node and rapidly splits into a left and right branch, each destined for a different ventricle. Finally, these bundle branches terminate in the small [[Purkinje fibers]] that innervate myocardial tissue. The His-Purkinje system conducts action potentials much faster than can be propagated between myocardial cells, allowing the entire ventricular myocardium to contract in less time, improving pump function.<ref name="Sauer-2022a" />

Most pathological causes of bradycardia result from damage to this normal cardiac conduction system at various levels: the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, or damage to conduction tissue between or after these nodes.

=== Sinus node ===
Bradycardia caused by the alterations of sinus node activity is divided into three types.

==== Sinus bradycardia ====
[[Sinus bradycardia]] is a [[sinus rhythm]] of less than 50 BPM.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kusumoto FM, Schoenfeld MH, Barrett C, Edgerton JR, Ellenbogen KA, Gold MR, Goldschlager NF, Hamilton RM, Joglar JA, Kim RJ, Lee R, Marine JE, McLeod CJ, Oken KR, Patton KK, Pellegrini CN, Selzman KA, Thompson A, Varosy PD | title = 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Circulation | volume = 140 | issue = 8 | pages = e382-e482 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30586772 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000628 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Cardiac action potentials are generated from the SA node and propagated through an otherwise normal conduction system, but they occur at a slow rate. It is a common condition found in both healthy individuals and those considered well-conditioned athletes.<ref name="hafeez222"/> Studies have found that 50–85% of conditioned athletes have benign sinus bradycardia, as compared to 23% of the general population studied.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bryan G, Ward A, Rippe JM | title = Athletic heart syndrome | journal = Clinics in Sports Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 259–272 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1591784 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-5919(20)30529-9 | publisher = Elsevier }}</ref> The heart muscle of athletes has a higher [[stroke volume]], requiring fewer contractions to circulate the same volume of blood.<ref name="HN3">{{cite book |title=Harwood-Nuss' Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7817-5125-4 |editor=Allan B. Wolfson |edition=4th |page=260|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins }}</ref> Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia decreases in prevalence with age.

==== Sinus arrhythmia ====
Sinus arrhythmias are heart rhythm abnormalities characterized by variations in the cardiac cycle length over 120 milliseconds (longest cycle - shortest cycle).<ref name="Patterson_2022"/> These are the most common type of arrhythmia in the general population and usually have no significant consequences. They typically occur in the young, athletes or after administration of medications such as morphine. The types of sinus arrhythmia are separated into the respiratory and non-respiratory categories.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

===== Respiratory sinus arrhythmia =====
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia refers to the physiologically normal variation in heart rate due to breathing. During inspiration, vagus nerve activity decreases, reducing parasympathetic innervation of the sinoatrial node and  causing an increase in heart rate. During expiration, heart rates fall due to the converse occurring.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

===== Non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia =====
Non-respiratory causes of sinus arrhythmia include sinus pause, [[Sinoatrial arrest|sinus arrest]], and [[Sinoatrial block|sinoatrial exit block]]. Sinus pause and arrest involve slowing or arresting of automatic impulse generation from the sinus node. This can lead to [[asystole]] or cardiac arrest if [[Ventricular escape beat|ventricular escape rhythms]] do not create backup sources of cardiac action potentials.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

Sinoatrial exit block is a similar non-respiratory phenomenon of temporarily lost sinoatrial impulses. However, in contrast to a sinus pause, the action potential is still generated at the SA node but is either unable to leave or delayed from leaving the node, preventing or delaying atrial depolarization and subsequent ventricular systole. Therefore, the length of the pause in heartbeats is usually a multiple of the P-P interval, as seen on electrocardiography. Like a sinus pause, a sinoatrial exit block can be symptomatic, especially with prolonged pause length.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

==== Sinus node dysfunction ====
A syndrome of intrinsic disease of the sinus node, referred to as sick sinus syndrome or [[sinus node dysfunction]], covers conditions that include symptomatic sinus bradycardia or persistent chronotropic incompetence, [[sinoatrial block]], [[sinus arrest]], and tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/> These conditions can be caused by damage to the native sinus node itself and are frequently accompanied by damaged AV node conduction and reduced backup pacemaker activity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = John RM, Kumar S | title = Sinus Node and Atrial Arrhythmias | journal = Circulation | volume = 133 | issue = 19 | pages = 1892–1900 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27166347 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.018011 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The condition can also be caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that regulates the node and is commonly exacerbated by medications.<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

===Atrioventricular node===
Bradycardia can also result from the inhibition of the flow of action potentials through the atrioventricular (AV) node. While this can be normal in young patients due to excessive vagus nerve tone, symptomatic bradycardia due to AV node dysfunction in older people is commonly due to structural heart disease, myocardial ischemia, or age-related fibrosis.<ref name="Sauer-2022b"/>
[[File:Heart block.png|thumb|Characteristic ECGs of atrioventricular blocks, organized by degree.]]

==== Atrioventricular block ====
[[Atrioventricular block]]s are divided into three categories, ranked by severity. AV block is diagnosed via surface ECG, which is usually sufficient to locate the causal lesion of the block without the need for an invasive [[electrophysiology study]].<ref name="Patterson_2022"/>

In [[First-degree atrioventricular block|1st degree AV block]], electrical impulses originating in the SA node (or other ectopic focus above the ventricles) are conducted with significant delay through the AV node. This condition is diagnosed via ECG, with [[PR interval]]s in excess of 200 milliseconds.<ref name="Patterson_2022" /> The PR interval represents the length of time between the start of atrial depolarization and the start of ventricular depolarization, representing the flow of electrical impulses between the SA and AV nodes. Despite the term "block," no impulses are fully lost in this conduction but are merely delayed. The location of the causal lesion can be anywhere between the AV node and the His-Purkinje system but is most commonly found in the AV node itself.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark BA, Prystowsky EN | title = Electrocardiography of Atrioventricular Block | journal = Cardiac Electrophysiology Clinics | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 599–605 | date = December 2021 | pmid = 34689889 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccep.2021.07.001 | s2cid = 239091592 }}</ref> Generally, isolated PR prolongation in 1st degree AV block is not associated with increased mortality or hospitalization.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aro AL, Anttonen O, Kerola T, Junttila MJ, Tikkanen JT, Rissanen HA, Reunanen A, Huikuri HV | title = Prognostic significance of prolonged PR interval in the general population | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–129 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23677846 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/eht176 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Second-degree atrioventricular block|2nd degree AV block]] is characterized by intermittently lost conduction of impulses between the SA node and the ventricles. 2nd degree block is classified into two types. Mobitz type 1 block, otherwise known by the eponym [[Karel Frederik Wenckebach|Wenckebach]], classically demonstrates grouped patterns of heartbeats on ECG. Throughout the group, the PR interval gradually lengthens until a dropped conduction occurs, resulting in no QRS complex seen on surface ECG following the last P wave. After a delay, the grouping repeats, with the PR interval shortening again to baseline.<ref name="Clark-2021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark BA, Prystowsky EN | title = Electrocardiography of Atrioventricular Block | journal = Cardiac Electrophysiology Clinics | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 599–605 | date = December 2021 | pmid = 34689889 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccep.2021.07.001 | s2cid = 239091592 }}</ref> Type 1 2nd degree AV block due to disease in the AV node (as opposed to in the His-purkinje system) rarely needs intervention with pacemaker implantation.<ref name="Clark-2021" />

2nd degree, Mobitz type 2 AV block is another phenomenon of intermittently dropped QRS complexes after characteristic groupings of beats seen on surface ECG. The PR and RR intervals are consistent in this condition, followed by a sudden AV block and dropped QRS complex.<ref name="Clark-2021"/> Because type 2 blocks are typically due to lesions below the AV node, the ability for ventricular escape rhythms to maintain cardiac output is compromised. Permanent pacemaker implantation is often required.<ref name="Sauer-2022b">{{Cite book | vauthors = Sauer WH, Koplan BA |chapter=The Bradyarrhythmias: Disorders of the Atrioventricular Node| veditors = Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson JL |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2022 |edition=21st  | isbn = 978-1-264-26850-4 }}</ref>

==== Junctional rhythms ====
An [[AV-junctional rhythm]], or atrioventricular nodal bradycardia, is usually caused by the absence of the electrical impulse from the [[sinus node]]. This usually appears on an [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] with a normal [[QRS complex]] accompanied by an inverted [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]] either before, during, or after the QRS complex.<ref name="HN3"/>

An AV-junctional escape beat is a delayed heartbeat originating from an [[Ectopic beat|ectopic]] focus somewhere in the [[AV junction]]. It occurs when the rate of [[depolarization]] of the [[SA Node|SA node]] falls below the rate of the [[AV Node|AV node]].<ref name="HN3"/> This [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]] may also occur when the electrical impulses from the SA node fail to reach the AV node because of SA or AV block.<ref name=AHA>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=746|title=AV Junctional Rhythm Disturbances (for Professionals)|date=4 December 2008|publisher=American Heart Association|access-date=15 December 2009}}</ref> This is a protective mechanism for the heart to compensate for an SA node that is no longer handling the pacemaking activity and is one of a series of backup sites that can take over pacemaker function when the SA node fails to do so. This would present with a longer [[PR interval]]. An AV-junctional escape complex is a normal response that may result from excessive vagal tone on the SA node. Pathological causes include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinus exit block, or AV block.<ref name="HN3"/>

===Ventricular===
[[Idioventricular rhythm]], also known as atrioventricular bradycardia or ventricular escape rhythm, is a heart rate of less than 50 BPM. This is a safety mechanism when a lack of electrical impulse or stimuli from the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] occurs.<ref name="HN3"/> Impulses originating within or below the [[bundle of His]] in the AV node will produce a wide QRS complex with heart rates between 20 and 40 BPM. Those above the bundle of His, also known as junctional, will typically range between 40 and 60 BPM with a narrow QRS complex.<ref name="merck">{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec07/ch075/ch075a.html|title=Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders|date=January 2008|work=The Merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|publisher=Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp|access-date=16 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=ajcc/> In a [[third-degree heart block]], about 61% take place at the bundle branch-Purkinje system, 21% at the AV node, and 15% at the bundle of His.<ref name=ajcc>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams MG, Pelter MM | title = Ventricular escape rhythms | journal = American Journal of Critical Care | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 477–478 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14503433 | doi = 10.4037/ajcc2003.12.5.477 }}</ref> AV block may be ruled out with an ECG indicating "a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes."<ref name="merck"/> Ventricular bradycardias occurs with sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, and AV block. Treatment often consists of the administration of [[atropine]] and [[cardiac pacing]].<ref name="HN3"/>

===Infantile===
For infants, bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than 100&nbsp;BPM (normal is around 120–160 BPM). Premature babies are more likely than full-term babies to have apnea and bradycardia spells; their cause is not clearly understood. The spells may be related to centers inside the brain that regulate breathing which may not be fully developed. Touching the baby gently or rocking the incubator slightly will almost always get the baby to start breathing again, which increases the heart rate. The [[neonatal intensive-care unit]] standard practice is to electronically monitor the heart and lungs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Causes==
Bradycardia [[arrhythmia]] may have many causes, both cardiac and non-cardiac.

Non-cardiac causes are usually secondary and can involve [[recreational drug use]] or [[drug abuse|abuse]], metabolic or endocrine issues, especially [[hypothyroidism]], an [[electrolyte imbalance]], neurological factors, [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic reflexes]], situational factors, such as prolonged [[bed rest]], and [[autoimmune|autoimmunity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ye F, Hatahet M, Youniss MA, Toklu HZ, Mazza JJ, Yale S | title = The Clinical Significance of Relative Bradycardia | journal = WMJ | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–78 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 30048576 }}</ref> At rest, although tachycardia is more commonly seen in [[Fatty-acid metabolism disorder|fatty acid oxidation disorders]], acute bradycardia can occur more rarely.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonnet D, Martin D, Villain E, Jouvet P, Rabier D, Brivet M, Saudubray JM | title = Arrhythmias and conduction defects as presenting symptoms of fatty acid oxidation disorders in children | journal = Circulation | volume = 100 | issue = 22 | pages = 2248–2253 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10577999 | doi = 10.1161/01.cir.100.22.2248 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Cardiac causes include acute or chronic [[ischemic heart disease]], vascular heart disease, [[valvular heart disease]], or degenerative primary electrical disease. Ultimately, the causes act by three mechanisms: depressed automaticity of the heart, conduction block, or escape pacemakers and rhythms.<ref name="What is Bradycardia">{{cite web |url=https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/bradycardia | title=What is Bradycardia?
| website=WebMD |access-date= 5 July 2021}}</ref>

In general, two types of problems result in bradycardias: disorders of the SA node and disorders of the AV node.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/bradyarrhythmias/ | title=Bradyarrhythmias | website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 5 July 2021}}</ref>

With SA node dysfunction (sometimes called sick sinus syndrome), there may be disordered automaticity or impaired conduction of the impulse from the SA node into the surrounding atrial tissue (an "exit block"). Second-degree sinoatrial blocks can be detected only by use of a 12-lead ECG.<ref name="NCBI">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ufberg JW, Clark JS | title = Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks | journal = Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9, v | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16308110 | doi = 10.1016/j.emc.2005.08.006 }}</ref> It is difficult and sometimes impossible to assign a mechanism to any particular bradycardia, but the underlying mechanism is not clinically relevant to treatment, which is the same in both cases of sick sinus syndrome: a permanent [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].<ref name="What is Bradycardia"/>

AV conduction disturbances (AV block; [[First-degree AV block|primary AV block]], [[Second-degree AV block|secondary type I AV block]], [[Second-degree AV block|secondary type II AV block]], [[Third-degree AV block|tertiary AV block]]) may result from impaired conduction in the AV node or anywhere below it, such as in the bundle of His. The clinical relevance pertaining to AV blocks is greater than that of SA blocks.<ref name="NCBI" />

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of bradycardia in adults is based on a heart rate of less than 60 BPM,<ref name="hafeez222"/> although some studies use a heart rate of less than 50 BPM.<ref name="ACLS2010" /> This is usually determined either by palpation or ECG.<ref name="hafeez222"/> If symptoms occur, a determining electrolytes may help determine the underlying cause.<ref name="webmd.com"/>

==Management==
The treatment of bradycardia depends on whether the person is stable or unstable.<ref name="hafeez222"/><ref name=ACLS2010/>

===Stable===
Emergency treatment is not needed if the person is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.<ref name=ACLS2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Neumar RW, Otto CW, Link MS, Kronick SL, Shuster M, Callaway CW, Kudenchuk PJ, Ornato JP, McNally B, Silvers SM, Passman RS, White RD, Hess EP, Tang W, Davis D, Sinz E, Morrison LJ | title = Part 8: adult advanced cardiovascular life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 18 Suppl 3 | pages = S729-S767 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20956224 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Unstable===
If a person is unstable, the initial recommended treatment is intravenous [[atropine]].<ref name=ACLS2010/> Doses less than 0.5&nbsp;mg should not be used, which may further decrease the rate.<ref name=ACLS2010/> If this is ineffective, intravenous [[inotrope]] infusion ([[dopamine (medication)|dopamine]], [[epinephrine]]) or [[transcutaneous pacing]] should be used.<ref name=ACLS2010/> [[Transvenous pacing]] may be required if the cause of the bradycardia is not rapidly reversible.<ref name=ACLS2010/>
