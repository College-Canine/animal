'''Hypoadrenocorticism in dogs''', or, as it is known in people, '''[[Addison's disease]]''', is an [[endocrine system]] disorder that occurs when the [[adrenal gland]]s fail to produce enough [[hormone]]s for normal function. The adrenal glands secrete [[glucocorticoid]]s such as [[cortisol]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/adrenal/steroids.html|title=Adrenal Steroids|publisher=School of Veterinary Medicine-Colorado State University|access-date=26 January 2011}}</ref> and [[mineralocorticoid]]s such as [[aldosterone]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/adrenal/mineralo.html|title=Mineralocorticoids|publisher=School of Veterinary Medicine-Colorado State University|access-date=26 January 2011}}</ref> when proper amounts of these are not produced, the metabolic and [[electrolyte]] balance is upset.<ref name="Electrolytes">{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm |title=What Are Electrolytes?|author =Stoeppler, Melissa Conrad|publisher=MedicineNet|access-date=17 April 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100421092245/http://www.medicinenet.com/electrolytes/article.htm| archive-date= 21 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> Mineralocorticoids control the amount of [[Potassium in biology|potassium]], sodium, and water in the body.<ref name=Cortex/><ref name=peted>{{cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1597&aid=520|title=Addison's Disease (Hypoadrenocorticism) in Dogs|publisher=Drs.

Hypoadrenocorticism is more frequent in dogs than in humans; in fact, it may occur one hundred times more often in the canine population. It mostly affects young to middle-aged female dogs,<ref name=Canada/> as the average age at diagnosis being four years old (although it has been found in puppies and dogs up to twelve years old). About seventy percent of dogs that are diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism are female.<ref name=Stafford/><ref name=Canada/> Hypoadrenocorticism is still relatively uncommon or underdiagnosed in dogs. Statistics gathered from a large veterinary hospital placed the number at 0.36 dogs per 1000. For an average veterinary practice with two veterinarians and 1500 canine patients, this would mean an average of one diagnosis of the disease each year.<ref name=Canada/><ref name=Percortenpdf>{{cite web|url=http://www.percorten.novartis.us/pdf/Percorten_V_Monograph.pdf |author =Kelch, WJ |work=The Compendium |title=Canine hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's Disease) |date=June 1998 |page=4 |access-date=29 September 2012 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702013556/http://www.percorten.novartis.us/pdf/Percorten_V_Monograph.pdf |archive-date=July 2, 2015 }}([[PDF]])</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
The most common clinical manifestations are related to mental status and gastrointestinal function; they include lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, and weakness. Additional findings may include dehydration, bradycardia, weak femoral pulses, [[abdominal pain]], lack of appetite, tremors or shaking, muscle weakness, low body temperature, collapse, and pain in the hindquarters.<ref name="Merck" /><ref name="petplace" /> Polyuria and polydipsia, diarrhea, and shivering are occasionally reported.

[[Hypoglycemia]] can also be present, and initially may be confused with a seizure disorder or an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor ([[insulinoma]]).  Hypoadrenocorticism may also be misdiagnosed as food poisoning, parvovirus [[enteritis]], [[gastric volvulus]], or spinal/joint problems, earning this disease nicknames like "the Great Mimic" and "the Great Imitator".<ref name=Stafford/><ref name=Brooks/> It is possible not to see any signs of the disease until 90% of the adrenal cortex is no longer functioning.<ref name=Southpaws/>

===Addisonian crisis===

If hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium) are severe, the resulting hypovolemia, prerenal azotemia, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s may result in an Addisonian crisis. In severe cases, the patient may be presented in shock and moribund. Addisonian crisis must be differentiated from other life-threatening disorders such as [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], necrotizing pancreatitis, and septic peritonitis.<ref>Gough, Alex (2007). Differential diagnosis in Small Animal Medicine. Blackwell Publishing: Carlton, Victoria.</ref>

== Causes ==
[[Image:Gray1185.png|thumb|right|200px|Layers of the adrenal cortex (the outer portion of the adrenal gland)]]
The adrenal glands are located above the [[kidney]]s. The [[Adrenal gland#Cortex|adrenal outer layer]], or cortex, has three layers; each produces a specific type of steroid.<ref name=Cortex>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/40202.htm|title=Adrenal Cortex|publisher=Merck Veterinary Manual|year=2008|access-date=26 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=Brooks/>

===Primary===
[[Image:Anatomy and physiology of animals Adrenal glands.jpg|thumb|Primary disease: problem with the adrenal glands.]]
[[Adrenal insufficiency|Primary adrenocortical insufficiency]] is the more common form of hypoadrenocorticism. All layers of the adrenal gland stop functioning; the problem is with the adrenal gland.<ref name=Merck/> This causes a deficiency of both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid secretion. Most cases are classified as idiopathic, although immune-mediated adrenocortical destruction is a likely cause. Bilateral destruction of the [[adrenal cortex]] by neoplasia (e.g. lymphosarcoma), granulomatous disease, or [[Thrombosis|arterial thrombosis]] can also cause primary adrenocortical insufficiency. The destruction is progressive, although variable in rate, ultimately leading to complete loss of adrenocorotical function. A partial deficiency syndrome may occur initially, with signs manifested only during times of [[Stress (biological)|stress]] (e.g., boarding, travel, surgery).

===Secondary===
[[Image:Pituitary gland representation.PNG|thumb|Secondary disease: problem with the anterior pituitary.]]
In secondary hypoadrenocorticism the problem is not in the adrenal gland but in the [[pituitary gland]]. Usually, the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior portion]] of the pituitary gland produces a hormone, [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), that signals the [[zona fasciculata]] and [[zona reticularis]] to produce their steroids. When the pituitary is unable to produce ACTH, these zones stop production of their hormones. The [[zona glomerulosa]] is not controlled by ACTH, and remains able to produce a normal amount of mineralocorticoids.<ref name=Merck/> A dog with secondary hypoadrenocorticism only needs to have medication to replace the glucocorticoid steroid cortisol.<ref name=Canada/><ref name=Brooks/><ref name=Canadian/> One dog in every 42 diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism has the secondary form of the disease where mineralocorticoid production remains intact.<ref name=Brooks/>

Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency involves only a deficiency of glucocorticoid secretion. Destructive lesions (e.g. neoplasia, inflammation) in the [[pituitary gland]] or hypothalamus and chronic administration of exogenous glucocorticoids or megestrol acetate (cats) are the most common causes.<ref>Nelson and Couto (2005). Manual of Small Animal [[Internal medicine|Internal Medicine]]. 2nd Edition. Elsevier Mosby: St. Louis, Missouri. p.503-507</ref>

===Drug induced===
Drug induced ([[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]]) hypoadrenocorticism is caused during abrupt cessation of a [[corticosteroid|steroid]] medication.<ref name=Adrenal>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/adrenal/histo_overview.html|title=Overview of Adrenal Histology|publisher=School of Veterinary Medicine-Colorado State University|access-date=26 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2009&Category=8069&PID=53472&O=Generic|title=Corticosteroids: Friend or Foe?|author =Maddison, Jill|year=2009|publisher=Proceedings of the 34th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association|access-date=11 February 2011}}</ref> During steroid treatment, the adrenal glands do not function fully. The body senses the levels of the [[exogenous]] steroids in the system and therefore does not signal for additional production.<ref name=Brooks/> The usual protocol for stopping steroid medications is not to eliminate them suddenly, but to withdraw from them gradually in a "tapering off" process, which allows the production to adjust to normal. If steroids are abruptly withdrawn, the dormant adrenal glands may not able to reactivate, and the body will need to have its adrenal glucocorticoid hormones replaced by medication.<ref name=Brooks/>

== Diagnosis ==
Hypoadrenocorticism is often tentatively diagnosed on the basis of history, physical findings, [[clinical pathology]], and, for primary adrenal insufficiency, characteristic electrolyte abnormalities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Alex|title=Demystifying Tests for Hyperadrenocorticism|url=http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/ASK_Demystifying%20Tests%20for%20HAC.pdf|work=Clinicians' Brief|date=November 2014|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222040116/http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/ASK_Demystifying%20Tests%20for%20HAC.pdf|archive-date=2014-12-22}}</ref>

*Clinical pathology - Abnormalities may be identified on hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis. Elevated concentrations of potassium ([[hyperkalemia]]), and low sodium and chloride values ([[hyponatremia]] and [[hypochloremia]]) are the classic electrolyte alterations. The sodium/potassium ratio often is <27 (normal is between 27:1 and 40:1) and maybe <20 in animals with primary adrenal insufficiency.<ref name=":0" /> However, not all dogs have an abnormal [[electrolyte]] ratio during an Addisonian episode.<ref name=Canada/>
*ECG - The severity of the [[ECG]] abnormalities correlates with the severity of the hyperkalemia. Therefore, the ECG can be used to identify and estimate the severity of hyperkalemia and to monitor changes in serum potassium during therapy.
*Diagnostic imaging - Abdominal ultrasound may reveal small [[adrenal gland]]s, suggesting adrenocortical atrophy. However, finding normal-sized adrenal glands does not rule out hypoadrenocorticism. Rarely, megaesophagus is evident on radiographs.
*[[ACTH stimulation test]] - Confirmation requires evaluation of an ACTH stimulation test. Baseline plasma cortisol and urine cortisol/Cr ratios are unreliable for confirming the diagnosis. One major diagnostic criterion is abnormally decreased post-ACTH plasma cortisol. Normal plasma cortisol after ACTH stimulation rules out adrenal insufficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lathan|first1=P|last2=Moore|first2=GE|last3=Zambon|first3=S|last4=Scott-Moncrieff|first4=JC|title=Use of a low-dose ACTH stimulation test for diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs.|journal=Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|date=2008|volume=22|issue=4|pages=1070–3|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0118.x|pmid=18537878|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=ACVIM|first1=Ronald Lyman DVM Dipl.|title=Consider ACTH stimulation test when you suspect canine hyperadrenocorticism|url=http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/consider-acth-stimulation-test-when-you-suspect-canine-hyperadrenocorticism|work=dvm360.com|date=November 1, 2008|access-date=January 23, 2017|archive-date=July 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704182712/http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/consider-acth-stimulation-test-when-you-suspect-canine-hyperadrenocorticism|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ACTH Stimulation Test|url=http://www.idexx.com.tw/pdf/zh_tw/smallanimal/snap/cortisol/cortisol-acth-stimulation-protocol.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020508/http://www.idexx.com.tw/pdf/zh_tw/smallanimal/snap/cortisol/cortisol-acth-stimulation-protocol.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|publisher=Idexx|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> The only accurate test for hypoadrenocorticism is an [[ACTH stimulation test]]; however, any administration of a steroid other than [[dexamethasone]] will invalidate this test.<ref name=Stafford/><ref name=Merck/><ref name=Canadian/> Carry out test by:<ref name=":0" />
**Measuring serum cortisol before and after administration of ACTH gel or synthetic ACTH
***Normal dogs generally have post stimulation cortisol levels > 10&nbsp;ug/dl. 
***Post stimulation levels < 2&nbsp;ug/dl is considered diagnostic and most Addison's patients are < 1&nbsp;ug/dl.

The ACTH stimulation test does not distinguish between primary and secondary hypoadrenocorticism, or adrenocortical destruction caused by mitotane overdose. Differentiation between primary and secondary hypoadrenocorticism can be made by periodically measuring serum electrolytes, baseline endogenous ACTH, or possibly serum or plasma aldosterone during the ACTH stimulation test. While most [[corticosteroid]] drugs will invalidate the results of an ACTH test, [[dexamethasone]] may be used in the event of an Addison's emergency without fear of compromising the results of the test.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axiomvetlab.com/GUIDE%20TO%20ENDOCRINOLOGY.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904195357/http://www.axiomvetlab.com/GUIDE%20TO%20ENDOCRINOLOGY.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-04 |title=Guide to Endocrinology|website=Axiom Vet Lab|pages=7|access-date=16 May 2011}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Aggressiveness of therapy depends on the clinical status of the patient and the nature of the insufficiency (glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or both). Many dogs and cats with primary adrenal insufficiency are presented in Addisonian crisis and require immediate, aggressive therapy. In contrast, secondary insufficiency often has a chronic course.

If the owner knows about an upcoming stressful situation (shows, traveling etc.), the animals generally need an increased dose of prednisone (2-4 times maintenance) to help deal with the added stress. Avoidance of stress is important for dogs with hypoadrenocorticism.

===Addisonian crisis===

Treatment is directed towards (1) correcting hypotension, hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalances, and [[metabolic acidosis]]; (2) improving vascular integrity, and (3) providing an immediate source of glucocorticoids. Rapid correction of hypovolemia is the first priority.

Restoring blood volume is vital to correcting hypotension, hypovolemia, and addressing electrolyte and metabolic imbalances. This is achieved by the rapid administration of fluids. This helps to correct hyponatremia, restore perfusion to organs, and reduce hyperkalemia through increased GFR and dilution effects. Further treatment of hyperkalemia is addressed if necessary. Often, the fluid therapy can sufficiently address hyperkalemia, but in the presence of significant cardiac abnormalities, the addition of [[calcium gluconate]] may be necessary in addition to glucose, insulin, or bicarb to promote intracellular shift of potassium.<ref name=":0" />

Most patients show dramatic improvement within 24 to 48 hours of appropriate fluid and glucocorticoid therapy. Over the ensuing 2 to 4 days, a gradual transition from [[Intravenous therapy|IV fluids]] to oral water and food is undertaken, and maintenance mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid therapy is initiated. Failure to make this transition smoothly should raise suspicion of insufficient glucocorticoid supplementation, concurrent endocrinopathy (e.g. [[hypothyroidism]]), or concurrent illness (especially renal damage).

It is important that after the crisis is corrected that the patient is put on a maintenance therapy of corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids.

==Epidemiology==
Hypoadrenocorticism is typically a disease of young to middle-aged female dogs, although Standard Poodles and Bearded Collies of both sexes are prone to the condition.<ref name="Lathan 2005">{{cite journal|last1=Lathan|first1=P|last2=Tyler|first2=JW|title=Canine Hypoadrenocorticism: Pathogenesis and Clinical Features|journal=Compendium|date=February 2005|volume=27|issue=2|pages=110–120|url=http://www.vetfolio.com/internal-medicine/canine-hypoadrenocorticism-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features|access-date=2017-08-20|publisher=VetFolio}}</ref>

Hypoadrenocorticism is an inherited disease in the following breeds (and therefore a higher proportion of dogs within these breeds are affected, compared to other breeds):<ref name="Scott-M 2014">{{cite book|last1=Scott-Moncrieff|first1=JC|editor1-last=Feldman|editor1-first=EC|editor2-last=Nelson|editor2-first=RW|editor3-last=Reusch|editor3-first=CE|editor4-last=Scott-Moncrieff|editor4-first=JCR|title=Canine and feline endocrinology|date=2014|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4557-4456-5|pages=485–520|edition=4th|chapter=Chapter 12: Hypoadrenocorticism}}</ref>

==History==
The first case of hypoadrenocorticism in dogs was recorded in 1953, over 100 years after it was described in humans by [[Thomas Addison]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=C|last2=Marshall|first2=C|last3=Downs|first3=J|title=Addison's disease in the dog.|journal=The Veterinary Record|date=29 April 1989|volume=124|issue=17|pages=469–70|doi=10.1136/vr.124.17.469|pmid=2728304|s2cid=37536148}}</ref>
