The '''West Highland White Terrier''', commonly known as the '''Westie''', is a [[dog breed|breed of dog]] from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white undercoat. It is a medium-sized [[terrier]], although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance.

The breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt [[rodents]].

The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programmes of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the [[Cairn Terrier]], the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such.

Other related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's [[Pittenweem]] Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.

The breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at [[Cruft's]]. It has been in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s.

Several breed-specific and non-specific health problems appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed "[[Craniomandibular osteopathy|westie jaw]]" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a very energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around one hour per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/search/breeds-a-to-z/breeds/terrier/west-highland-white-terrier/|title=West Highland White Terrier|website=thekennelclub.org.uk|access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref>

==Appearance==
[[File:Westie Chloe.jpg|thumb| Westies have dense, thick [[Down hair|undercoat]] and a smooth [[Guard hair|outer coat]]]]
Commonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect.<ref name=howellbook/> Members of the breed typically weigh between {{convert|15|and|20|lb|kg}}, and the average height is between {{convert|10|-|11|in|cm}} at the [[withers]].<ref name=howellbook/> The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.<ref name=howellbook/>

They also have a deep chest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short, closely fitted jaw with "scissors" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors).<ref name=newterrier/> The Westie's paws are slightly turned out to give it better grip than flat-footed breeds when it climbs on rocky surfaces.<ref name="bruette191"/> In young puppies, the nose and footpads have pink markings, which slowly turn black as they age.<ref name=newterrier/> Westies also have short and sturdy tails. Some sources suggest that due to their history as rodent catchers, their tails were bred to be thick so that a Westie trapped in a hole could be easily pulled out by the tail.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Temperament==
[[File:Westie pups.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two white terrier puppies stand next to each other: They appear less furry than the adults of their breed, and the pinkness inside the ears is evident.|Two Westie puppies]]
The temperament of the West Highland White Terrier can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children, while others prefer solitude.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} It will not typically tolerate rough handling, such as a child pulling on its ears or fur, and can frequently be both food- and toy-possessive.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} This makes regular training from a young age of particular importance. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner but is often on the move, requiring daily exercise (15–30 min though ideally, at least an hour). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.<ref name="rice6">[[#dogdigital|Rice (2002)]]: p. 6</ref>

It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in [[dog toy|toys]], especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits,<ref name="rice6"/> as well as natural instincts to bark and dig holes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.westieclubamerica.com/Versatile-westies-earthdog.html |title= Westie Earthdog or 'Going-to-Ground' |website=West Highland White Terrier Club of America |access-date=October 30, 2021 }}</ref> It is ranked in the average range as 88th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=The Intelligence of Dogs |year=2006|page=124|publisher=Pocket Books|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-4165-0287-6}}</ref>

The breed is pre-disposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal [[hernia]]s.<ref name="ackerman115">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 115</ref> Westie puppies may be affected by [[craniomandibular osteopathy]], a disease also known as "lion jaw", and is sometimes also referred to as "westie jaw".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/puppy-farmer-grace-banks-jailed-11297373|title=Puppy farmer Grace Banks jailed for selling sick dogs... while on bail for selling sick dogs|last=Cox|first=Charlotte|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=May 6, 2016|access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref> The disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both of its parents are carriers of the faulty [[gene]]. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the [[Great Dane]]. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. [[Radiographic testing]] can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary.<ref name="ackerman1167">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: pp. 116–117</ref>

The breed is prone to skin disorders.<ref name=newterrier /> About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by [[atopic dermatitis]], a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grayson|first=J.

[[File:Warmly Clothed Westie Puppy.jpg|thumb|Westie puppy]]
An inherited genetic problem that exists in the breed is [[globoid cell leukodystrophy]]. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including [[Beagle]]s and [[Pomeranian dog|Pomeranian]]s. It is a neurological disease wherein the dog lacks the enzyme [[galactosylceramidase]]. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed.<ref name="ackerman105">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 105</ref> Another genetic condition that affects the breed is "[[white dog shaker syndrome]]". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and [[Maltese dog|Maltese]], the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other non-white breeds including the [[Yorkshire Terrier]] and the [[Dachshund]]. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and [[hypermetria]]. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.<ref name="ackerman155">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 155</ref>

Other less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of [[Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid]] are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and [[ataxia]], but is more commonly found in [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]s.<ref name="ackerman108">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 108</ref> A degeneration of the hip joint, known as [[Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome]], also occurs in the breed.<ref name="ackerman125">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 125</ref> However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the [[Australian Shepherd]] and the [[Miniature Pincher]].<ref name="ackerman126">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 126</ref> The breed is also one of the least likely to be affected by a [[luxating patella]], where the knee cap slips out of place.<ref name="ackerman134">[[#ackerman2011|Ackerman (2011)]]: p. 134</ref>

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rhodes | first=Karen Helton | last2=Werner | first2=Alexander H. | title=Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | publication-place=Ames, Iowa | date=2011-01-25 | isbn=978-0-8138-1596-1 | page=94}}</ref>

Hyperplastic dermatosis of the West Highland White Terrier, also known as epidermal dysplasia or colloquially armadillo westie syndrome is an uncommon condition exclusively identified in the West Highland White Terrier. It is a severe chronic hyperplastic dermatological disease that is similar to [[seborrhoeic dermatitis]] and [[primary seborrhoea]]. Due to the fact it's only identified in the breed and evidence of familial involvement it's believed to be an inherited trait. [[''Malassezia'']] infection is associated with the onset or worsening of symptoms. Symptoms involve generalised and serious patches of [[alopecia]], [[erythema]], [[lichenification]], [[hyperpigmentation]], [[malodor]], [[otitis externa]], and [[pruritus]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=NISHIFUJI | first=Koji | last2=PARK | first2=Seong-Jun | last3=IWASAKI | first3=Toshiroh | title=A Case of Hyperplastic Dermatosis of the West Highland White Terrier Controlled by Recombinant Canine Interferon-.GAMMA.

==History==
[[File:1899 Scotties White.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photo of three terriers|Three Pittenweem Terriers, photographed in 1899]]
Scottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of [[James VI of Scotland]], who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen of these white terriers be procured from [[Argyll]] to be presented to the [[Early modern France|Kingdom of France]] as a gift.<ref name="bruette191">[[#bruette1921|Bruette (1921)]]: p. 191</ref> Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak.<ref name="smith84">[[#smith1910|Smith (1921)]]: p. 84</ref> At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the [[Scottish Terrier]] and the [[Cairn Terrier]] breeds.<ref name="rice5"/>

Reports of a ship from the [[Spanish Armada]] being wrecked on the island of [[Skye]] in 1588 indicated the ship carried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other breeds by [[Clan Donald]], including the families of the Chiefs.<ref name=spanishwhitedogs>{{cite book|last=Dalziel|first=Hugh|title=British dogs; their varieties, history, characteristics, breeding, management and exhibition|year=1879|publisher=The Bazaar Office|location=London, UK|page=350|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishdogstheir00dalzrich#page/350/mode/2up/search/white}}</ref> Other families on Skye preserved both white and sandy-coloured dogs. One such family was the [[Clan MacLeod]], and it was reported by their descendants that at least two [[Chiefs of Clan MacLeod|Chiefs]] kept white terriers, including "The Wicked Man" [[Norman MacLeod (The Wicked Man)|Norman MacLeod]], and his grandson Norman, who became Chief after his death.<ref name="smith84"/>

[[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]], chief of [[Clan Campbell]], bred a breed of white Scottish terriers known as the "Roseneath Terrier".<ref name=malcolmincanada>{{cite web|last=Horter|first=Ria|title=Col. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, and the West Highland White Terrier|url=http://www.riahorter.com/DOGS%20IN%20CANADA%20-%20MASTERMIND-Col%20Edward%20Malcolm%20%20WHWT.pdf|publisher=Dogs in Canada|date=April 2009|access-date=30 September 2011}}</ref> Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of "Pittenweem Terriers" out of a female [[Scottish Terrier]] which produced white offspring.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He re-dedicated his breeding programme to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=doggypeople>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Charles Henry|title=Dog shows and doggy people|year=1902|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London, UK|pages=100–102|url=https://archive.org/stream/dogshowsdoggypeo00lanerich#page/100/mode/2up}}</ref>
[[File:West Highland White Terrier from 1915.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photograph of a small white terrier, looking very similar to the modern breed|A West Highland White Terrier, photographed in 1915]]
The person most closely associated with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the "Poltalloch Terrier". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed. The term "West Highland White Terrier" first appears in ''Otters and Otter Hunting'' by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.<ref name=malcolmincanada/><ref>{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Ludovick Charles Richard Duncombe-Jewell|title=Otters and otter-hunting|year=1908|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=43|url=https://archive.org/stream/ottersotterhunti00came#page/42/mode/2up/search/highland}}</ref>

The first breed club was set up in 1904; [[Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll]], was the society's first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the [[Countess of Aberdeen]] as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman. [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] recognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at [[Crufts]] for the first time in the same year.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907–1908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year to the West Highland White Terrier Club of America.<ref name="rice5">[[#dogdigital|Rice (2002)]]: p. 5</ref> The breed spent the period that immediately followed as being "in vogue",<ref name=hochwell>{{cite book|last=Hochwell|first=A.

By the time of Malcolm's death in 1930, a stable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat, and a short back.<ref name=malcolmincanada/>

In major [[conformation show]]s, the breed has been equally successful on both sides of the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time as a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at the age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised independently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was reregistered as a West Highland White Terrier.<ref name=malcolmincanada/> The first win at a major show came at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1942 when Constance Winant's Ch.
