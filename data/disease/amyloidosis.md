<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Amyloidosis''' is a group of diseases in which abnormal [[protein]]s, known as [[amyloid fibrils]], build up in tissue.<ref>{{cite web|title=AL amyloidosis|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5797/al-amyloidosis|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|publisher=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)|access-date=22 April 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424001401/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5797/al-amyloidosis|archive-date=24 April 2017}}</ref> There are several non-specific and vague signs and symptoms associated with amyloidosis.<ref name="Gertz_2020" /> These include fatigue, [[peripheral edema]], [[weight loss]], [[shortness of breath]], [[palpitations]], and [[Orthostatic hypotension|feeling faint with standing]].<ref name="Gertz_2020" /> In AL amyloidosis, specific indicators can include enlargement of the tongue and periorbital [[purpura]].<ref name="Gertz_2020" /> In wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, non-cardiac symptoms include: bilateral [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], lumbar [[spinal stenosis]], [[biceps tendon rupture]], [[Small fiber peripheral neuropathy|small fiber neuropathy]], and [[autonomic dysfunction]].<ref name="Gertz_2020" />

<!-- Types -->
There are about 36 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific [[Proteopathy|protein misfolding]].<ref name="Picken_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Picken MM | title = The Pathology of Amyloidosis in Classification: A Review | language = english | journal = Acta Haematologica | volume = 143 | issue = 4 | pages = 322–334 | date = 2020 | pmid = 32392555 | doi = 10.1159/000506696 | s2cid = 218600304 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Within these 36 proteins, 19 are grouped into [[Organ-limited amyloidosis|localized forms]], 14 are grouped as [[Systemic disease|systemic forms]], and three proteins can identify as either.<ref name="Picken_2020" /> These proteins can become irregular due to genetic effects, as well as through acquired [[environmental factor]]s.<ref name="Picken_2020" /> The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are [[AL amyloidosis|light chain (AL)]], inflammation ([[AA amyloidosis|AA]]), [[Haemodialysis-associated amyloidosis|dialysis-related]] (Aβ<sub>2</sub>M), and hereditary and old age ([[Familial amyloid polyneuropathy|ATTR]] and [[wild-type transthyretin amyloid]]<ref name=Ando2020>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ando Y, Coelho T, Berk JL, Cruz MW, Ericzon BG, Ikeda S, Lewis WD, Obici L, Planté-Bordeneuve V, Rapezzi C, Said G, Salvi F | display-authors = 6 | title = Guideline of transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis for clinicians | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 8 | pages = 31 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23425518 | pmc = 3584981 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-8-31 | doi-access = free }}</ref>).<ref name="Haz2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hazenberg BP | title = Amyloidosis: a clinical overview | journal = Rheumatic Disease Clinics of North America | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 323–345 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23597967 | doi = 10.1016/j.rdc.2013.02.012 | s2cid = 215069282 | url = https://research.rug.nl/files/17452552/Amyloidosis_Clinics_NA_2013.pdf }}</ref>

<!-- Diagnosis -->
Diagnosis may be suspected when [[proteinuria|protein is found in the urine]], [[organomegaly|organ enlargement]] is present, or [[polyneuropathy|problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves]] and it is unclear why.<ref name=Haz2013/> Diagnosis is confirmed by [[tissue biopsy]].<ref name=Haz2013/> Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach.<ref name="Pep2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepys MB | title = Amyloidosis | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 57 | pages = 223–241 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16409147 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.57.121304.131243 }}</ref>

<!-- Treatment, prognosis, epidemiology, and history -->
Treatment is geared towards decreasing the amount of the involved protein.<ref name=Haz2013/> This may sometimes be achieved by determining and treating the underlying cause.<ref name=Haz2013/> AL amyloidosis occurs in about 3–13 per million people per year and AA amyloidosis in about two per million people per year.<ref name=Haz2013/> The usual age of onset of these two types is 55 to 60 years old.<ref name=Haz2013/> Without treatment, life expectancy is between six months and four years.<ref name=Haz2013/> In the [[developed world]] about one per 1,000 deaths are from systemic amyloidosis.<ref name=Pep2006/> Amyloidosis has been described since at least 1639.<ref name=Haz2013/>

The presentation of amyloidosis is broad and depends on the site of amyloid accumulation. The kidney and heart are the most common organs involved.

===Kidneys===
[[Amyloid]] deposition in the [[kidney]] often involve the [[glomerular capillaries]] and [[Mesangial cell|mesangial regions]], affecting the organ's ability to filter and excrete waste and retain [[plasma protein]].<ref name="niddk">{{cite web | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. | title = Amyloidosis & Kidney Disease. | work = National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. | access-date = 19 November 2021 | url = https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/amyloidosis | archive-date = 19 November 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211119221959/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/amyloidosis | url-status = live }}</ref> This can lead to high levels of protein in the urine ([[proteinuria]]) and [[nephrotic syndrome]].<ref name="niddk" /> Several types of amyloidosis, including the AL and AA types, are associated with [[nephrotic syndrome]].<ref name="Lewis_2018">{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis JB, Neilson EG | date = 2018 | chapter = Glomerular Diseases | veditors = Jameson J, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Loscalzo J | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = 20 | publisher = McGraw Hill | chapter-url = https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=2129&sectionid=192281295 | access-date = 29 November 2021 | archive-date = 29 November 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211129202923/https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=2129&sectionid=192281295 | url-status = live }}</ref> Approximately 20% and 40–60% of people with AL and AA amyloidosis respectively progress to [[End stage kidney disease|end-stage kidney disease]] requiring [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]].<ref name="Lewis_2018" />

===Heart===
{{Main|Cardiac amyloidosis}}
Amyloid deposition in the heart can cause both diastolic and systolic [[heart failure]]. [[Electrocardiogram|EKG]] changes may be present, showing low voltage and conduction abnormalities like [[atrioventricular block]] or [[sinus node]] dysfunction.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}} On [[Echocardiogram|echocardiography]], the heart shows a restrictive filling pattern, with normal to mildly reduced systolic function.<ref name="Falk_1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Falk RH, Comenzo RL, Skinner M | title = The systemic amyloidoses | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 337 | issue = 13 | pages = 898–909 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9302305 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199709253371306 }}</ref> AA amyloidosis usually spares the heart.<ref name="Ebert_2008" /> Cardiac amyloidosis can present with symptoms of heart failure including shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema.<ref name="Kyriakou_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyriakou P, Mouselimis D, Tsarouchas A, Rigopoulos A, Bakogiannis C, Noutsias M, Vassilikos V | title = Diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis: a systematic review on the role of imaging and biomarkers | journal = BMC Cardiovascular Disorders | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 221 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30509186 | pmc = 6278059 | doi = 10.1186/s12872-018-0952-8 | doi-access = free }}</ref> As cardiac amyloidosis progresses, the amyloid deposition can affect the heart's ability to pump and fill blood as well as its ability to maintain normal rhythm, which leads to worsening heart function and decline in people's quality of life.<ref name="Kyriakou_2018" />

===Nervous system===
People with amyloidosis may have central nervous system involvement,<ref>Soprano DR, Herbert J, Soprano KJ, Schon EA, Goodman DS. Demonstration of transthyretin mRNA in the brain and other extrahepatic tissues in the rat. J Biol Chem 1985; 260 (21) 11793-11798</ref> along with peripheral involvement which causes sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Sensory neuropathy develops in a symmetrical pattern and progresses in a distal to proximal manner. Autonomic neuropathy can present as [[orthostatic hypotension]] but may manifest more gradually with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms like constipation, nausea, or early satiety.<ref name="Falk_1997" /> Amyloidosis of the central nervous system can have more severe and systemic presentations that may include life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiac failure, malnutrition, infection, or death.<ref name="Kaku_2019" />

Neuropathic presentation can depend on the etiology of amyloidosis.<ref name="Kaku_2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaku M, Berk JL | title = Neuropathy Associated with Systemic Amyloidosis | journal = Seminars in Neurology | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 578–588 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31639841 | doi = 10.1055/s-0039-1688994 | s2cid = 204850185 }}</ref> People with amyloidosis may experience dysfunction in various organ systems depending on the location and extent of nervous system involvement.<ref name="niddk" /> For example, peripheral neuropathy can cause erectile dysfunction, incontinence and constipation, pupillary dysfunction, and sensory loss depending on the distribution of amyloidosis along different peripheral nerves.<ref name="Kaku_2019" />

===Gastrointestinal and accessory organs===
Accumulation of amyloid proteins in the gastrointestinal system may be caused by a wide range of amyloid disorders and have different presentations depending on the degree of organ involvement.<ref name="Rowe_2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowe K, Pankow J, Nehme F, Salyers W | title = Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis: Review of the Literature | journal = Cureus | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1228 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28611935 | doi = 10.7759/cureus.1228 | doi-access = free | pmc = 5464793 }}</ref> Potential symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn (gastrointestinal reflux), and GI bleeding.<ref name="Rowe_2017" /> Amyloidosis may also affect accessory digestive organs including the liver, and may present with jaundice, fatty stool, anorexia, fluid buildup in the abdomen, and spleen enlargement.<ref name="Rowe_2017" />

Accumulation of amyloid proteins in the liver can lead to elevations in serum [[aminotransferase]]s and [[alkaline phosphatase]], two biomarkers of liver injury, which is seen in about one third of people.<ref name="Ebert_2008" /> [[Hepatomegaly|Liver enlargement]] is common. In contrast, [[Splenomegaly|spleen enlargement]] is rare, occurring in 5% of people.<ref name="Falk_1997" /> Splenic dysfunction, leading to the presence of [[Howell-Jolly bodies]] on blood smear, occurs in 24% of people with amyloidosis.<ref name="Falk_1997" /> [[Malabsorption]] is seen in 8.5% of [[AL amyloidosis]] and 2.4% of AA amyloidosis. One suggested mechanism for the observed malabsorption is that amyloid deposits in the tips of [[intestinal villi]] (fingerlike projections that increase the intestinal area available for absorption of food),  begin to erode the functionality of the villi, presenting a [[coeliac disease|sprue]]-like picture.<ref name="Ebert_2008" />

===Glands===
Both the [[Thyroid gland|thyroid]] and [[adrenal gland]]s can be infiltrated. It is estimated that 10–20% of people with amyloidosis have [[hypothyroidism]]. Adrenal infiltration may be harder to appreciate given that its symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and low blood sodium concentration may be attributed to [[autonomic neuropathy]] and heart failure.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

"Amyloid deposits occur in the [[pancreas]] of people who also have [[diabetes mellitus]], although it is not known if this is functionally important. The major component of pancreatic amyloid is a 37-amino acid residue peptide known as [[islet amyloid polypeptide]] or 'amylin.' This is stored with insulin in secretory granules in [[islet cell|[beta] cell]]s and is co secreted with insulin." (Rang and Dale's Pharmacology, 2015.){{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

===Musculoskeletal system===
Amyloid proteins deposit most commonly inside the knee, followed by hands, wrists, elbow, hip, and ankle, causing joint pain.<ref name="Takahashi 2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi N, Glockner J, Howe BM, Hartman RP, Kawashima A | title = Taxonomy and Imaging Manifestations of Systemic Amyloidosis | journal = Radiologic Clinics of North America | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 597–612 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27153791 | doi = 10.1016/j.rcl.2015.12.012 }}</ref> In males with advanced age (>80 years), there is significant risk of wild-type transthyretin amyloid deposition in synovial tissue of knee joint, but predominantly in old age deposition of wild type transthyretin is seen in cardiac ventricles. ATTR deposits have been found in [[Ligamenta flava|ligamentum flavum]] of patients that underwent surgery for [[lumbar spinal stenosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eldhagen |first1=P. |last2=Berg |first2=S. |last3=Lund |first3=L.

In beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis, males have high risk of getting [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].<ref name="Nguyen_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen TX, Naqvi A, Thompson TL, Wilson RH | title = Musculoskeletal Manifestations of Amyloidosis: A Focused Review | journal = Journal of Surgical Orthopaedic Advances | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date =Spring 2018 | pmid = 29762107 }}</ref> Aβ2MG amyloidosis (Hemodialysis associated amyloidosis) tends to deposit in synovial tissue, causing chronic [[synovitis|inflammation of the synovial tissue]] in knee, hip, shoulder and interphalangeal joints.<ref name="Nguyen_2018" /> Amyloid light chains deposition in shoulder joint causes enlarged shoulders, also known as "[[shoulder pad sign]]".<ref name="Nguyen_2018" /> Amyloid light chain depositions can also cause bilateral symmetric polyarthritis.<ref name="Nguyen_2018" />

The deposition of amyloid proteins in the bone marrow without causing [[plasma cell dyscrasias]] is called amyloidoma. It is commonly found in cervical, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae. Those affected may be presented with bone pain due to bone lysis, lumbar [[paraparesis]], and a variety of neurological symptoms. Vertebral fractures are also common.<ref name="Nguyen_2018"/>

===Eyes===
A rare development is [[amyloid purpura]], a susceptibility to bleeding with bruising around the eyes, termed "raccoon-eyes". Amyloid purpura is caused by amyloid deposition in the blood vessels and reduced activity of [[thrombin]] and [[factor X]], two clotting proteins that lose their function after binding with amyloid.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

===Oral cavity===
Amyloid deposits in tissue can cause enlargement of structures. Twenty percent of people with AL amyloidosis have an [[macroglossia|enlarged tongue]], that can lead to [[obstructive sleep apnea]], [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], and altered taste.<ref name="Ebert_2008" /> Tongue enlargement does not occur in ATTR or AA amyloidosis.<ref name="Falk_1997" /> Deposition of amyloid in the throat can cause hoarseness.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

==Pathogenesis==
{{main|Amyloid}}
Amyloidoses can be considered [[protein misfolding]] diseases.<ref name="Chiti_2017" /><ref name="Merlini_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Merlini G, Seldin DC, Gertz MA | title = Amyloidosis: pathogenesis and new therapeutic options | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 14 | pages = 1924–1933 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21483018 | pmc = 3138545 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2271 }}</ref> The vast majority of proteins that have been found to form amyloid deposits are [[secreted protein]]s, so the misfolding and formation of amyloid occurs outside cells, in the [[extracellular]] space.<ref name="Chiti_2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiti F, Dobson CM | title = Protein Misfolding, Amyloid Formation, and Human Disease: A Summary of Progress Over the Last Decade | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 86 | pages = 27–68 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28498720 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-045115 | hdl = 2158/1117236 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Of the 37 proteins so far identified as being vulnerable to amyloid formation, only four are [[cytosol]]ic.<ref name="Chiti_2017" /> Most amyloid-forming proteins are relatively small, but otherwise there is currently no evidence of structural or functional similarities among proteins known to form disease-associated amyloids.<ref name="Chiti_2017" />  One third of amyloid disease is hereditary, in which case there is normally an early age of onset.<ref name="Chiti_2017" /> Half of amyloid-related diseases are sporadic and have a late age of onset – in these cases, the protein aggregation may be associated with aging-related decline in protein regulation. Some medical treatments are associated with amyloid disease, but this is rare.<ref name="Chiti_2017" />

Amyloid-forming proteins aggregate into distinctive fibrillar forms with a [[beta-sheet]] structure.<ref name="Chiti_2017" /><ref name=Merlini_2011 /> The beta-sheet form of amyloid is [[proteolysis]]-resistant, meaning it can not be degraded or broken down.<ref name="Gertz_2020" /> As a result, amyloid deposits into the body's extracellular space.<ref name="Gertz_2020" /> The process of forming amyloid fibrils is thought to have intermediate [[oligomer]]ic forms. Both the oligomers and amyloid fibrils can be toxic to cells and can interfere with proper organ function.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Gertz MA, Rajkumar SV |title=Amyloidosis |date=2010 |publisher=Humana |location=Totowa, N.J. |isbn=978-1-60761-631-3 |oclc=654382006}}</ref> The relative significance of different aggregation species may depend on the protein involved and the organ system affected.<ref name=Merlini_2011 />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of amyloidosis generally requires tissue biopsy.<ref name="Haz2013" /> The biopsy is assessed for evidence of characteristic amyloid deposits. The tissue is treated with various [[Histology#Common laboratory stains|stains]]. The most useful stain in the diagnosis of amyloid is [[Congo red]], which, combined with [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]], makes the amyloid proteins appear apple-green on [[microscopy]]. Also, [[Thioflavin|thioflavin T]] stain may be used.<ref name="Dember2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dember LM | title = Amyloidosis-associated kidney disease | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 3458–3471 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17093068 | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2006050460 | url = http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/17/12/3458.long | url-status = live | doi-access = free | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111205032749/http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/17/12/3458.long | archive-date = 5 December 2011 }}</ref> A number of imaging techniques such as a Nuclear Medicine PYP scan, [[DPD scan]] or [[SAP scan]] are also in use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachchithanantham S, Wechalekar AD | title = Imaging in systemic amyloidosis | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 107 | pages = 41–56 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23896486 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/ldt021 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

A sample of tissue can be biopsied or obtained directly from the affected internal organ, but the first-line site of biopsy is [[Subcutaneous tissue#Subcutaneous fat|subcutaneous abdominal fat]], known as a "fat pad biopsy", due to its ease of acquisition.<ref name="Merlini_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Merlini G, Dispenzieri A, Sanchorawala V, Schönland SO, Palladini G, Hawkins PN, Gertz MA | title = Systemic immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis | journal = Nature Reviews.

In the amyloid deposition of the joints, there will be a decreased signal in both [[MRI sequence#T1 and T2|T1 and T2 weighted MRI images]].<ref name="Takahashi 2016"/> In amyloidoma, there will be low T1 signal with gadolinium injection and low T2 signal.<ref name="Nguyen_2018"/>

The type of the amyloid protein can be determined in various ways: the detection of abnormal proteins in the bloodstream (on [[protein electrophoresis]] or light chain determination); binding of particular antibodies to the amyloid found in the tissue (immunohistochemistry); or extraction of the protein and identification of its individual [[amino acid]]s.<ref name=Dember2006/> Immunohistochemistry can identify AA amyloidosis the majority of the time, but can miss many cases of AL amyloidosis.<ref name="Ebert_2008" /> [[Laser capture microdissection|Laser microdissection]] with [[mass spectrometry]] is the most reliable method of identifying the different forms of amyloidosis.<ref name="Rosenzweig_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenzweig M, Landau H | title = Light chain (AL) amyloidosis: update on diagnosis and management | journal = Journal of Hematology & Oncology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 47 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22100031 | pmc = 3228694 | doi = 10.1186/1756-8722-4-47 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

AL was previously considered the most common form of amyloidosis, and a diagnosis often begins with a search for [[plasma cell dyscrasia]], memory B cells producing aberrant immunoglobulins or portions of immunoglobulins. Immunofixation electrophoresis of urine or serum is positive in 90% of people with AL amyloidosis.<ref name="Falk_1997" /> Immunofixation electrophoresis is more sensitive than regular electrophoresis but may not be available in all centers. Alternatively immunohistochemical staining of a bone marrow biopsy looking for dominant plasma cells can be sought in people with a high clinical suspicion for AL amyloidosis but negative electrophoresis.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

ATTR is now considered to be the most common form of amyloidosis. It may be either age related in wild-type ATTR (ATTRv) or familial transthyretin-associated amyloidosis, is suspected in people with family history of idiopathic neuropathies or heart failure who lack evidence of plasma cell dyscrasias. ATTR can be identified using [[isoelectric focusing]] which separates mutated forms of transthyretin. Findings can be corroborated by [[genetic testing]] to look for specific known mutations in transthyretin that predispose to amyloidosis.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

AA is suspected on clinical grounds in individuals with longstanding infections or inflammatory diseases. AA can be identified by immunohistochemistry staining.<ref name="Falk_1997" />

=== Classification ===
Historical classification systems were based on clinical factors. Until the early 1970s, the idea of a single amyloid substance predominated. Various descriptive classification systems were proposed based on the organ distribution of amyloid deposits and clinical findings. Most classification systems included primary (i.e., [[idiopathic]]) amyloidosis, in which no associated clinical condition was identified, and secondary amyloidosis (i.e., [[wikt:secondary|secondary]] to chronic inflammatory conditions). Some classification systems included myeloma-associated, familial, and localized amyloidosis.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

The modern era of amyloidosis classification began in the late 1960s with the development of methods to make amyloid fibrils soluble. These methods permitted scientists to study the chemical properties of amyloids.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}} Descriptive terms such as primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis, and others (e.g., senile amyloidosis), which are not based on cause, provide little useful information and are no longer recommended.

The modern classification of amyloid disease tends to use an abbreviation of the protein that makes the majority of deposits, prefixed with the letter A. For example, amyloidosis caused by [[transthyretin]] is termed "ATTR".{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}} Deposition patterns vary between people but are almost always composed of just one amyloidogenic protein. Deposition can be [[Systemic disease|systemic]] (affecting many different organ systems) or organ-specific. Many amyloidoses are [[genetic disorder|inherited]], due to [[mutations]] in the precursor protein.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Other forms are due to different diseases causing overabundant or abnormal protein production – such as with overproduction of [[immunoglobulin light chains]] (termed [[AL amyloidosis]]), or with continuous overproduction of [[acute phase protein]]s in [[chronic inflammation]] (which can lead to [[AA amyloidosis]]).{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}}

====Alternative====
An older clinical method of classification refers to amyloidoses as systemic or localised:
* Systemic amyloidoses affect more than one body organ or system. Examples are AL, AA and Aβ2m.<ref name="Kumar5-12">Table 5-12 in: {{cite book | vauthors = Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 }} 8th edition.</ref>
* Localised amyloidoses affect only one body organ or tissue type. Examples are [[Aβ]], [[Amylin|IAPP]], [[Atrial natriuretic factor]] (in [[isolated atrial amyloidosis]]), and [[Calcitonin]] (in [[medullary carcinoma of the thyroid]])<ref name=Kumar5-12/>

Another classification is primary or secondary.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}}
* [[primary amyloidosis|Primary amyloidoses]] arise from a disease with disordered immune cell function, such as [[multiple myeloma]] or other immunocyte dyscrasias.
* Secondary (reactive) amyloidoses occur as a complication of some other chronic inflammatory or tissue-destroying disease. Examples are [[reactive systemic amyloidosis]] and [[secondary cutaneous amyloidosis]].<ref name=Kumar5-12/>

Additionally, based on the tissues in which it is deposited, it is divided into mesenchymal (organs derived from [[mesoderm]]) or parenchymal (organs derived from [[ectoderm]] or [[endoderm]]).{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2021}}

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the type of amyloidosis that is present. Treatment with high dose [[melphalan]], a [[chemotherapy]] agent, followed by [[stem cell]] transplantation has shown promise in early studies and is recommended for stage I and II AL amyloidosis.<ref name="Rosenzweig_2011" /> However, only 20–25% of people are eligible for stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy treatment including cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone is currently the recommended treatment option for people with AL Amyloidosis not eligible for transplant.<ref name="Gertz_2020" />

In AA, symptoms may improve if the underlying condition is treated. In people who have inflammation caused by AA amyloidosis, [[TNF inhibitor|tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors]] such as [[infliximab]] and [[etanercept]] are used for an average duration of 20 months. If TNF-alpha inhibitors are not effective, [[Interleukin-1 family|Interleukin-1]] inhibitors (e.g., [[anakinra]], [[canakinumab]], [[rilonacept]]) and [[Interleukin 6|interleukin-6]] inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) may be considered.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = ter Haar NM, Oswald M, Jeyaratnam J, Anton J, Barron KS, Brogan PA, Cantarini L, Galeotti C, Grateau G, Hentgen V, Hofer M, Kallinich T, Kone-Paut I, Lachmann HJ, Ozdogan H, Ozen S, Russo R, Simon A, Uziel Y, Wouters C, Feldman BM, Vastert SJ, Wulffraat NM, Benseler SM, Frenkel J, Gattorno M, Kuemmerle-Deschner JB | display-authors = 6 | title = Recommendations for the management of autoinflammatory diseases | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 1636–1644 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26109736 | doi = 10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207546 | hdl = 2445/108897 | s2cid = 18876892 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

Diflunisal binds to misfolded mutant TTR protein to prevent its buildup, like how tafamidis works. Low-certainty evidence indicates that it mitigates worsening of [[peripheral neuropathy]] and disability from disease progression.<ref name="Magrinelli_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Magrinelli F, Fabrizi GM, Santoro L, Manganelli F, Zanette G, Cavallaro T, Tamburin S | title = Pharmacological treatment for familial amyloid polyneuropathy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | pages = CD012395 | date = April 2020 | issue = 4 | pmid = 32311072 | pmc = 7170468 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012395.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Neuromuscular Group }}</ref>

Inotersen blocks gene expression of both wild-type and mutant TTR, reducing amyloid precursor. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that it mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy. Long-term efficacy and safety of inotersen use in people with mutant TTR-related amyloidosis is still be evaluated in a phase-III clinical trial as of 2021. Both diflunisal and inotersen may also mitigate declines in quality-of-life, though the evidence for this effect is unclear.<ref name="Magrinelli_2020" /> For people with cardiac ATTR the effect of inotersen use is inconclusive and requires further investigation.<ref name="Marques_2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marques N, Azevedo O, Almeida AR, Bento D, Cruz I, Correia E, Lourenço C, Lopes LR | display-authors = 6 | title = Specific Therapy for Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis: A Systematic Literature Review and Evidence-Based Recommendations | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 9 | issue = 19 | pages = e016614 | date = October 2020 | pmid = 32969287 | pmc = 7792401 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.120.016614 }}</ref> In 2018, [[inotersen]] was approved by the European Medicines Agency to treat polyneuropathy in adults with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tegsedi | work = Europeans Medicines Agency | url = https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tegsedi | access-date = 12 March 2021 | archive-date = 8 October 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201008061412/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tegsedi | url-status = live }}</ref> It has since been approved for use in Canada, the European Union and in the USA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathew V, Wang AK | title = Inotersen: new promise for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis | language = English | journal = Drug Design, Development and Therapy | volume = 13 | pages = 1515–1525 | date = 6 May 2019 | pmid = 31118583 | pmc = 6507904 | doi = 10.2147/DDDT.S162913 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[Patisiran]] functions similarly to inotersen. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy and disability from disease progression. Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates decreases in quality-of-life and slightly reduces the rate of adverse events versus placebo. There is no evidence of an effect on mortality rate.<ref name="Magrinelli_2020" /> A review of early data from use of patisiran in people with variant cardiac ATTR suggests that it may reduce mortality and hospitalization, however this is still being investigated and requires further investigation.<ref name="Marques_2020" /> In 2018, patisiran was not recommended by NICE in the UK for hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patisiran for treating hereditary transthyretinrelated amyloidosis|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/gid-hst10014/documents/evaluation-consultation-document|access-date=20 July 2019|archive-date=4 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103207/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/gid-hst10014/documents/evaluation-consultation-document|url-status=live}}</ref> As of July 2019 further review however is occurring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patisiran for treating hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis [ID1279] {{!}} Guidance {{!}} NICE|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10014|access-date=20 July 2019|work=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)|archive-date=20 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720003858/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-hst10014|url-status=live}}</ref> It was approved for this use in the United States, however.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoy SM | title = Patisiran: First Global Approval | journal = Drugs | volume = 78 | issue = 15 | pages = 1625–1631 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30251172 | doi = 10.1007/s40265-018-0983-6 | s2cid = 52813638 }}</ref>

Amyloidosis has a combined estimated prevalence of 30 per 100,000 persons with the three most common forms being AL, ATTR, and AA.<ref name="Lin_2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin HM, Gao X, Cooke CE, Berg D, Labotka R, Faller DV, Seal B, Hari P | display-authors = 6 | title = Disease burden of systemic light-chain amyloidosis: a systematic literature review | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1017–1031 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28277869 | doi = 10.1080/03007995.2017.1297930 | s2cid = 205541963 }}</ref> The median age at diagnosis is 64.<ref name="Ebert_2008" />

AA amyloidoses is the most common form in developing countries and can complicate longstanding infections with [[tuberculosis]], [[osteomyelitis]], and [[bronchiectasis]]. AA amyloidosis is caused by an increase in extracellular deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein.
