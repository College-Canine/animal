'''Collies''' form a distinctive [[Dog type|type]] of [[herding dog]]s, including many related [[landrace]]s and [[Breed standard|standardized]] [[Dog breed|breed]]s.  The type originated in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]]. Collies are medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed snouts. Many types have a distinctive white color over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong [[herding]] instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially [[North America]] and [[Australia]]), and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types.

Some collie breeds have remained as [[working dog]]s for herding [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and other [[livestock]], while others are kept as [[pet]]s, [[show dog]]s or for [[List of dog sports|dog sport]]s, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the [[American Kennel Club]] has a breed they call "collie", in fact ''collie dogs'' are a distinctive type of herding dog inclusive of many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports: The latter typically display great agility, stamina, and trainability, and most importantly [[dog intelligence|intelligence]].
 		 	
Common use of the unmodified name "collie" in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds – the name means [[Rough Collie]] by default in parts of the United States, and [[Border Collie]] by default in many rural parts of Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} Many collie dog types do not actually include "collie" in their name – for example the [[Welsh Sheepdog]].

==Name==
The exact origin of the name ''collie'' is uncertain; it may derive from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word for 'coal'.<ref name="OED">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Collie, Colly |year=1933 |dictionary=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Alternatively it may come from the related word ''coolly'', referring to the [[Scottish Blackface|black-faced mountain sheep]] of Scotland.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hubbard, C.L.B. |year=1948 |title=Dogs in Britain: A description of all native breeds and most foreign breeds in Britain |publisher=Macmillan}}</ref>  The ''collie'' name usually refers to dogs of Scottish origin which have spread into many other parts of the world, often being called [[Herding dog|sheepdog]] or shepherd dog elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book |author=Combe, Iris |year=1987 |title=Herding Dogs: Their origins and development in Britain}}</ref>
Iris Combe, in her book, “Border Collies,” says that in old Gaelic “collie” was the rural term for anything useful — a “collie dog” was a useful dog.

==Description==

===Appearance===
Collies are generally medium-sized dogs of about {{Convert|48|to|70|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} and light to medium-boned. Cattle-herding types are stockier than sheep-herding types. The fur may be short,
or long, and the tail may be smooth, feathered, or bushy. In the 1800s, the occasional [[naturally bob-tailed]] dog would occur. The tail can be carried low with an upward swirl, or may be carried higher but never over the back. Each breed can vary in coloration, with the usual base colors being black, black-and-tan, red, red-and-tan, white with a colored head with it without other body coloration of sable, black and tan, blue merle, sable merle [[Coat (dog)|sable]]. They often have white along with the main color, usually under the belly and chest, over the shoulders, and on parts of the face and legs, but sometimes leaving only the head colored – or white may be absent (unusual) or limited to the chest and toes (as in the [[Australian Kelpie]]). [[Merle (coat colour in dogs)|Merle]] coloration may also be present over any of the other color combinations, even in landrace types. The most widespread patterns include sable, black and white, black and tan  and tricolour (black-and-tan and white).

===Temperament===
Collies range in trainability from the "average" to very biddable. The Border Collie is the breed most in need of a "job" to stimulate its brain, lest it become anxious and hyper, while many other collie breeds fit well into an active family lifestyle (though all collie types still require some mental stimulation). Collie-type breeds are also known for their sensitivity and awareness of emotions in people;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Francais |first1=Isabell |last2=Johnson |first2=Carol Ann |year=2005 |title=Bearded Collie |publisher=Kennel Club Books |isbn=1-59378-236-5 |page=158}}</ref> they may require gentler handling than other types of dogs.

=== Working type temperaments ===
A working member of a collie breed, such as the Border Collie, is an energetic and agile dog with great stamina. When in fit, working condition they are able to run all day without tiring, even over very rough or steep ground. Working collies display a keen intelligence for the job at hand and are instinctively highly motivated. They are often intensely loyal. Dogs of collie type or derivation occupy four of the first sixteen ranks in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', with the Border Collie being first.  These characteristics generally make working strains suitable for agility; in addition to herding work they are well suited to active sports such as [[sheepdog trial]]s, [[flyball]], [[disc dog]] and [[dog agility]].  Working strains have strong herding instincts, and some individuals can be single-minded to the point of obsessiveness.  Collies can compete in [[herding]] events.<ref name=Hartnagle-Taylor-2010>{{cite book |first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010 |title=Stockdog Savvy |publisher=Alpine Publications |isbn=978-1-57779-106-5}}</ref> Border Collies are used as search dogs in mountain rescue in Britain. They are particularly useful for searching large areas of hillside and avalanche debris. H.&nbsp;MacInnes believed that dark coated dogs are less prone to snow blindness.<ref>{{cite book |author=MacInnes, Hamish |year=1972 |title=International Mountain Rescue Handbook |place=London, UK |publisher=Constable |pages=47–63}}</ref>

=== Show and pet type temperaments ===
Certain types of collie (for example [[Rough Collie]]s, [[Smooth Collie]]s, [[Shetland Sheepdog]]s and some strains of Border Collie and other breeds) have been bred for many generations as [[pet]]s and for the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing, not as herding dogs.  All collie dog breeds have proved to be highly trainable, gentle, loyal, intelligent, and well suited as pets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rough Collie |series=breed description |website=[[Westminster Kennel Club]] |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/collier.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012193736/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/collier.html |archive-date=2007-10-12 }}<br/>{{cite web |website=Westminster Kennel Club |series=breed description |title=Smooth Collie |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/collier.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012193736/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/collier.html |archive-date=2007-10-12 }}<br/>{{cite web |title=Shetland Sheepdog  |series=breed description |website=[[Westminster Kennel Club]] |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/shetshee.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013053317/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breedinformation/herding/shetshee.html |archive-date=2007-10-13}}</ref> Their gentleness and devotion also make them quite compatible with children. They are often more suitable as watchdogs than as guard dogs, though the individual personalities of these dogs vary.

The temperament of these breeds has been featured in literature, film, and popular television programs. The novels of [[Albert Payson Terhune]], which were very popular in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, celebrated the temperament and companionship of his early AKC collies. More famously, the temperament and intelligence of the Rough Collie were exaggerated to mythic proportions in the character [[Lassie]], which has been the subject of many films, books, and television shows from 1938 to the present.

The Lassie character was featured in a book titled ''Lassie Come Home'' by Eric P. Knight. Knight's collie "Tootsie" was the inspiration for the book, which was a collection of stories based on her and other collie legends he collected from talking to friends and neighbors. One such story was most likely the documented tale of "[[Bobbie the Wonder Dog|Silverton Bobbie]]", the Oregon collie who crossed the US to get to his owners. While the dogs who played Lassie on-screen were from AKC lines, the actual Tootsie looked nothing like them, although she did come from a collie breeder.

==Health==
Some collie breeds (especially the Rough Collie, Smooth Collie, and the Australian Shepherd) are affected by a [[gene]]tic defect, a mutation within the [[P-glycoprotein|MDR1]] gene,<ref>{{cite web |title=Multi-drug sensitivity |series=College of Veterinary Medicine |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |place=Pullman, WA |url=https://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/depts-VCPL/#Drugs}}</ref> formerly known as "ivermectin sensitivity", but now known to cause lowered tolerance to a wide variety of different veterinary drugs.<ref name="Mealey"/> Approximately 70% of collies are affected,<ref name="Mealey">{{cite journal |last1=Mealey |first1=Katrina L. |last2=Owens |first2=Jane G. |title=Canine and feline P-glycoprotein deficiency: What we know and where we need to go |journal=Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |date=2022 |doi=10.1111/jvp.13102 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jvp.13102|pmc=10092536 }}</ref> making them very sensitive to some drugs, such as [[Ivermectin]], as well as to some [[antibiotic]]s, [[opioid]]s including [[loperamide]],<ref name="Mealey"/> and [[steroid]]s – over 100&nbsp;drugs in total. The MDR1 status of individual dogs can be easily tested for.<ref name="Mealey"/> In addition, the intestinal functional system of this breed is also very fragile, and compared with similar medium and large dogs, they are easy to receive food stimulation, which leads to vomiting and excretion abnormalities or gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, breeders need to ensure strict hygiene for dogs to eat fresh ingredients, and rich nutrition. The ''[[Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen]]'' (The [[Germany|German]] [[Kennel club|Kennel Club]]) encourages breed clubs to test all breeding stock and avoid breeding from affected dogs.

Collies may have a genetic disease, named ''canine [[cyclic neutropenia]]'', or ''grey collie syndrome''. This is a [[stem cell]] disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dale |first1=David C. |last2=Rodger |first2=Elin |title=Long-Term Treatment of Canine Cyclic Hematopoiesis With Recombinant Canine Stem Cell Factor |journal=Blood |date=1994 |volume=85 |issue=1 |page=74-79 |doi=10.1182/blood.V85.1.74.bloodjournal85174 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120697737}}</ref> Puppies with this disorder are quite often mistaken for healthy Blue Merles, even though their colour is a silver grey.{{CN|date=April 2024}} Affected puppies rarely live more than 6&nbsp;months.{{CN|date=April 2024}} For a puppy to be affected, both the sire and the dam have to be carriers of the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DiGiacomo |first1=Ronald F. |last2=Hammond |first2=William P. |title=Clinical and Pathologic Features of Cyclic Hematopoesis in Grey Collie Dogs |journal=The American Journal of Pathology |date=1983 |volume=111 |issue=2 |page=224-233 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1916339/pdf/amjpathol00194-0102.pdf}}</ref>

Canine familial dermatomyositis is an inherited idiopathic condition affecting the skin and muscle and in rare cases the blood vessels. The condition causes [[dermatitis]] throughout the body and proceeds to myositis which in severe cases leads to [[megaesophagus]]. Collies alongside the [[Beauceron]] and [[Shetland Sheepdog]] are known to have a predilection to the condition although it has been described in other breeds.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rhodes | first=Karen Helton | last2=Werner | first2=Alexander H. | title=Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | publication-place=Ames, Iowa | date=2011-01-25 | isbn=978-0-8138-1596-1 | page=172}}</ref>

==Collie types and breeds==
[[Herding dogs]] of collie [[Dog type|type]] have long been widespread in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and these can be regarded as a [[landrace]] from which a number of other landraces, types, and formal [[dog breed|breed]]s have been derived, both in Britain and elsewhere. Many of them are working herding dogs, but some have been bred for [[conformation show]]ing and as [[pet]]s, sometimes losing their working instincts in the course of selection for appearance or for a more subdued temperament.<ref name="Combe & Hutchinson">{{cite web |url=http://www.roughcolliesofdistinction.com/breed_ancestry.htm |first1=Iris |last1=Combe |first2=Pat |last2=Hutchinson |year=2004 |title=The ancestral relationships of contemporary British herding breeds |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614231213/http://www.roughcolliesofdistinction.com/breed_ancestry.htm |archive-date=14 June 2009}} —  Chart of relationships between various British herding dog breeds, and outline of their history.</ref>

Herding types tend to vary in appearance more than conformation and pet types, as they are bred primarily for their working ability, and appearance is thus of lower importance.

Dogs of collie type or ancestry include:

; [[Australian Kelpie]]: Developed in Australia from collies originally brought from Scotland and northern England. Erect ears, short-haired, usually black, black-and-tan or red-and-tan, with white limited to chest and toes.
; [[Australian Shepherd]]: Derives its name from the sheep imported from Australia in the 19th century, but native to the [[Western United States]]. Used as both a drover and guardian of sheep and cattle. Ancestry almost certainly includes British collie types and Basque and Spanish sheepdogs. Shaggy mid length coat in every colour including merle, half prick ears, bobbed tail, and (very important) eyes of different colour, heterochromia very common. 
[[File:Bearded Collie 600.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bearded Collie]]]]
; [[Bearded Collie]]: Now largely a pet and show breed, but still of the collie type, and some are used as working dogs. The Beardie has a flat, harsh, strong and shaggy outer coat and a soft, furry undercoat. The coat falls naturally to either side without need of a part. Long hair on the cheeks, lower lips, and under the chin forms the beard for which it is known.
: All Bearded Collies are born black, blue, brown, or fawn, with or without white markings. Some carry a fading gene, and as they mature, the coat lightens, darkening again slightly after one year of age. A puppy born black may become any shade of gray from black to slate to silver. The dogs that are born brown will lighten from chocolate to sandy, and the blues and fawns show shades from dark to light. Dogs without the fading gene stay the color they were when they were born. The white only occurs as a blaze on the face, on the head, on the tip of the tail, on the chest, legs, feet, and around the neck. Tan markings occasionally appear on the eyebrows, inside the ears, on the cheeks, under the root of the tail and on the legs where the white joins the main color.
; [[Blue Lacy]]: Grey or red all over, short hair, floppy ears.  Derived partly from the English Shepherd, with other non-collie breeds.
[[File:Male Border Collie Standing.jpg|alt=Male Border Collie|thumb|Border Collie]]
; [[Border Collie]]: The most well known breed for herding sheep throughout the world.  Originally developed in Scotland and Northern England.  Not always suitable for herding cattle. Ears semi-erect or floppy, fur silky or fairly long, but short on face and legs; red, black, black-and-tan or merle, all usually with white over shoulders, alternatively mostly white with coloured patches on head. Coat can be either long or short.
; [[Cumberland Sheepdog]]: An extinct breed similar to the Border Collie and possibly absorbed into that breed. An ancestor of the Australian Shepherd.  Erect or semi-erect ears, dense fur, black with white only on face and chest.
; [[English Shepherd]]: Developed in the U.S. from stock of Farm Collie type originally from [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Floppy ears, thick fur, red, black or black-and-tan, with white over shoulders. Not to be confused with the very different [[Old English Sheepdog]].
; [[Koolie|German Coolie]]: Also called ''[[Koolie]]'', or ''German Collie''. Developed in Australia, probably from British collies, but may have included dogs from [[Germany]] and [[Spain]].<ref name="lasrocosa.com">{{Cite web |title=Aussie history |website=Las Rocosa Australian Shepherds |url=http://www.lasrocosa.com/aussiehistory1.html}}</ref>  Erect ears, short fur, black, red, black-and-tan or merle, often with some white on neck or over shoulders. (Note: the name "German Collie" is also applied to a cross between a [[German Shepherd]] and a [[Border Collie]].)
; [[Huntaway]]: Developed in [[New Zealand]] from a mixture of breeds, probably including some collie – but it is not of the collie type. Larger and more heavily built than most collies, floppy ears, most commonly black-and-tan with little white.
; [[Lurcher]]: Not an established breed, but a cross of collie (or other [[herding dog]] or [[terrier]]) with [[Greyhound]] or other [[sight hound]]. Traditionally bred for [[poaching]], with the speed of a sight hound but more obedient and less conspicuous. Variable in appearance, but with greyhound build: Floppy ears, tall, slender, with small head, deep chest and "herring gut"; smooth, silky or rough coat, often brindled.
; [[McNab (dog)|McNab Shepherd]]: Developed in the U.S. from Scotch Collies and dogs imported by Basque sheepherders. Variable in size, erect or semi-erect ears, short to medium fur, black or red with some white on face, chest and/or feet.
; [[New Zealand Heading Dog]]: Also called ''New Zealand Eye Dog''. Developed in New Zealand from Border Collie heritage and used to bring sheep towards the shepherd, especially with strong eye contact and no barking.
; [[Old English Sheepdog]]: Derived from "Shags", hairy herding dogs, themselves derived from "Beards", the ancestors of the Bearded Collie. Modern dogs larger than most collies, no tail, floppy ears, long silky hair (including on face), usually grey and white. Not to be confused with the [[English Shepherd]].
; [[Scotch Collie]]: Scotch collies are separated into two varieties or breeds: [[Rough Collie]] and [[Smooth Collie]]. They are rather a different type to other collies with a long narrow face, tall, profuse coat and semi-erect ears. They are still used for herding as well as for showing. They were developed in the highlands of Scotland which is why they needed a profuse coat.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Ward, Andy |date=30 August 2019 |title=What did collies originally look like? Why do they have long noses? |website=oldtimefarmshepherd.org |url=http://www.oldtimefarmshepherd.org/current-collie-articles/what-did-pre-dog-show-scotch-collies-look-like/}}</ref> There are four recognised colors: Sable, tri-color, blue merle, and color headed white. Non-recognized colors are: Bi-black, sable merle, harlequin, red merle, red tricolor, and black and tan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Colors |series=Collie Fan |via=weebly.com  |url=http://colliefan.weebly.com/colours.html |url-status=dead |access-date=2014-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107015605/http://colliefan.weebly.com/colours.html |archive-date=2014-01-07}}</ref> Both the Rough and Smooth Collies are double-coated with Smooths having a shorter or "smooth" outer coat. There are three different coat types of Rough Collies: Brandwyn (fluffy coats), Parader (flat long coats) and the working type (medium-length coats).<ref>{{cite web |title=History |series=Collie Fan |via=weebly.com |url=http://colliefan.weebly.com/history.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723042459/http://colliefan.weebly.com/history.html |archive-date=2012-07-23}}</ref>
; [[Shetland Sheepdog]]: A small show and pet breed developed in England partly from herding dogs originating in [[Shetland]]. The original Shetland dogs were not collies, but instead working herding dogs of [[Spitz]] type, similar to the [[Icelandic Sheepdog]]. However, in the development of the modern Shetland breed these Spitz-type dogs were heavily mixed with the [[Rough Collie]] and [[toy dog|toy]] breeds, and now are similar in appearance to a miniature Rough Collie. Very small, nearly erect ears, long silky fur on body, most commonly sable or merle, with white over shoulders.
[[File:Welsh Sheepdog.jpg|thumb|right| [[Welsh Sheepdog]] ]]
; [[Smithfield (dog)|Smithfield]]: Originally a British type, now extinct used for droving cattle in the south-east of England, especially the [[Smithfield Market]] in London. They were large, strong collies, with white or black-and-white fur, and floppy-ears.<ref name="Combe & Hutchinson"/> Occasionally the name is used for modern dogs of a somewhat similar type in Australia. The name "Smithfield" is used to describe the shaggy Tasmanian farm dog of Bearded Collie type;<ref name=Hartnagle-Taylor-2010/> and is also applied to the [[Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog]] and may have contributed to the [[Australian Koolie]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Chandler, John |title=The "Smithfield" dog |website=wolfweb.com.au |url=http://www.wolfweb.com.au/acd/smithfield.htm}}</ref>
; [[Welsh Sheepdog]]: Landrace herding dog from [[Wales]]. Erect or semi-erect ears, short or silky fur, red, black, black-and-tan, or merle, all usually with white over shoulders.
