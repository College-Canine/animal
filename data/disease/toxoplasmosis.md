===Parasitology===
In its lifecycle, ''T. gondii'' adopts several forms.<ref name="Robert-GangneuxDarde2012"/> [[Tachyzoites]] are responsible for acute infection; they divide rapidly and spread through the tissues of the body. Tachyzoites are also known as "tachyzoic merozoites", a descriptive term that conveys more precisely the parasitological nature of this stage.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Terms for coccidian merozoites|journal=Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology|date=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=463|doi=10.1080/00034983.1987.11812147|pmid=3446034}}</ref> After proliferating, tachyzoites convert into [[bradyzoites]], which are inside latent intracellular tissue [[cyst]]s that form mainly in the muscles and brain. The formation of cysts is in part triggered by the pressure of the host immune system.<ref name=Miller2009/> The bradyzoites (also called "bradyzoic merozoites") are not responsive to antibiotics. Bradyzoites, once formed, can remain in the tissues for the lifespan of the host. In a healthy host, if some bradyzoites convert back into active tachyzoites, the immune system will quickly destroy them. However, in immunocompromised individuals, or in fetuses, which lack a developed immune system, the tachyzoites can run rampant and cause significant neurological damage.<ref name="Robert-GangneuxDarde2012"/>

The parasite also influences an anti-apoptotic mechanism, allowing the infected host cells to persist and replicate. One method of [[apoptosis]] resistance is by disrupting pro-apoptosis effector proteins, such as [[Bcl-2-associated X protein|BAX]] and [[Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer|BAK]].<ref name="Hippe_2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hippe D, Weber A, Zhou L, Chang DC, Häcker G, Lüder CG | title = ''Toxoplasma gondii'' infection confers resistance against Bim<sub>S</sub>-induced apoptosis by preventing the activation and mitochondrial targeting of pro-apoptotic Bax | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 122 | issue = Pt 19 | pages = 3511–21 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19737817 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.050963 | doi-access = free }}</ref> To disrupt these proteins, ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' causes conformational changes to the proteins, which prevent the proteins from being transported to various cellular compartments where they initiate apoptosis events.

The mechanisms above allow ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' to persist in a host.

''T. gondii'' has been shown to produce a protein called GRA28, released by the MYR1 secretory pathway, which interferes with gene expression in infected cells and results in cells that behave like dendritic cells, becoming highly mobile in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hoeve |first1=Arne L. ten |last2=Braun |first2=Laurence |last3=Rodriguez |first3=Matias E. |last4=Olivera |first4=Gabriela C. |last5=Bougdour |first5=Alexandre |last6=Belmudes |first6=Lucid |last7=Couté |first7=Yohann |last8=Saeij |first8=Jeroen P.

Since the parasite can change the host's immune response, it may also have an effect, positive or negative, on the immune response to other pathogenic threats.<ref name=Miller2009 /> This includes, but is not limited to, the responses to infections by ''[[Helicobacter felis]]'', ''[[Leishmania major]]'', or other parasites, such as ''[[Nippostrongylus brasiliensis]]''.<ref name=Miller2009 />

=== Transmission ===
Toxoplasmosis is generally transmitted through the mouth when ''Toxoplasma gondii'' [[oocyst]]s or tissue cysts are accidentally eaten.<ref name=Weiss_Dubey_2009/> Congenital transmittance from mother to fetus can also occur.<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Toxoplasma gondii'': the model apicomplexan: perspectives and methods |url=https://archive.org/details/toxoplasmagondii0000unse |url-access=registration |publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123695420}}</ref> Transmission may also occur during the solid organ transplant process<ref name=Der2008/> or hematogenous stem cell transplants.<ref name=Kh2016/>

Oral transmission may occur through:
* Ingestion of raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or venison containing ''Toxoplasma'' cysts: Infection prevalence in countries where undercooked meat is traditionally eaten has been related to this transmission method.

Cats excrete the pathogen in their feces for a number of weeks after contracting the disease, generally by eating an infected intermediate host that could include mammals (like rodents) or birds. Oocyst shedding usually starts from the third day after ingestion of infected intermediate hosts, and may continue for weeks. The oocysts are not infective when excreted.  After about a day, the oocyst undergoes a process called sporulation and becomes potentially pathogenic.<ref name=CDC2>{{cite web |url         = https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/biology.html |title       = Parasites – Toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma infection) |publisher   = Centers of Disease Control and Prevention |date        = 2011-04-05 |url-status     = live |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150828061023/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/biology.html |archive-date = 2015-08-28 }}</ref> In addition to cats, birds and mammals including human beings are also intermediate hosts of the parasite and are involved in the transmission process.

Toxoplasmosis may also be transmitted through solid organ transplants. Toxoplasma-seronegative recipients who receive organs from recently infected Toxoplasma-seropositive donors are at risk.

Not much evidence exists around the effect of education before pregnancy to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis.<ref name=Di2015>{{cite journal|last1=Di Mario|first1=S|last2=Basevi|first2=V|last3=Gagliotti|first3=C|last4=Spettoli|first4=D|last5=Gori|first5=G|last6=D'Amico|first6=R|last7=Magrini|first7=N|title=Prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=23 October 2015|volume=2015|issue=10|pages=CD006171|pmid=26493047|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006171.pub4|pmc=9272404|url=https://iris.unimore.it/bitstream/11380/1082489/2/Mario_et_al-2015-The_Cochrane_Library.sup-2.pdf|hdl=11380/1082489|hdl-access=free}}</ref> However educating parents before the baby is born has been suggested to be effective because it may improve food, personal and pet hygiene.<ref name=Di2015/> More research is needed to find whether antenatal education can reduce congenital toxoplasmosis.<ref name=Di2015/>

For pregnant women with negative antibody titers, indicating no previous exposure to ''T.&nbsp;gondii'', serology testing as frequent as monthly is advisable as treatment during pregnancy for those women exposed to ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' for the first time dramatically decreases the risk of passing the parasite to the fetus. Since a baby's immune system does not develop fully for the first year of life, and the resilient cysts that form throughout the body are very difficult to eradicate with antiprotozoans, an infection can be very serious in the young.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

To some extent, acute toxoplasmosis infections can be differentiated from chronic infections using an IgG [[avidity]] test, which is a variation on the ELISA. In the first response to infection, toxoplasma-specific IgG has a low affinity for the toxoplasma antigen; in the following weeks and month, IgG affinity for the antigen increases. Based on the IgG avidity test, if the IgG in the infected individual has a high affinity, it means that the infection began three to five months before testing. This is particularly useful in congenital infection, where pregnancy status and gestational age at time of infection determines treatment.<ref name="RemingtonThulliez2004">{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=J.

In 2021, twenty commercial anti-''Toxoplasma'' IgG assays were evaluated in a [[systematic review]], in comparison with an accepted reference method.<ref name="Robert-GangneuxGuegan2021"/> Most of them were enzyme-immunoassays, followed by agglutination tests, immunochromatographic tests, and a [[Western-Blot]] assay. The mean sensitivity of IgG assays ranged from 89.7% to 100% for standard titers and from 13.4% to 99.2% for low IgG titers. A few studies pointed out the ability of some methods, especially WB to detect IgG early after primary infection. The specificity of IgG assays was generally high, ranging from 91.3% to 100%; and higher than 99% for most EIA assays. The [[positive and negative predictive values|positive predictive value]] (PPV) was not a discriminant indicator among methods, whereas significant disparities (87.5–100%) were reported among negative predictive values (NPV), a key-parameter assessing the ability to definitively rule out a ''Toxoplasma'' infection in patients at-risk for opportunistic infections.<ref name="Robert-GangneuxGuegan2021">{{cite journal|last1=Robert-Gangneux|first1=Florence|last2=Guegan|first2=Hélène|title=Anti-''Toxoplasma'' IgG assays: What performances for what purpose?

===Congenital===
[[File:Toxoplasmosis, Congenital.jpg|thumb|Child with congenital toxoplasmosis]]
Recommendations for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis include: prenatal diagnosis based on [[Amniocentesis|testing]] of [[amniotic fluid]] and [[ultrasound]] examinations; neonatal diagnosis based on molecular testing of placenta and [[cord blood]] and comparative mother-child serologic tests and a clinical examination at birth; and early childhood diagnosis based on [[neurologic]] and [[ophthalmologic]] examinations and a serologic survey during the first year of life.<ref name="Sterkers_2011"/> During pregnancy, serological testing is recommended at three week intervals.<ref name="Sensini2006">{{cite journal|last1=Sensini|first1=A.|title=Toxoplasma gondii infection in pregnancy: opportunities and pitfalls of serological diagnosis|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|volume=12|issue=6|year=2006|pages=504–512|issn=1198-743X|doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01444.x|pmid=16700697|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Even though diagnosis of toxoplasmosis heavily relies on serological detection of specific anti-''Toxoplasma'' immunoglobulin, serological testing has limitations. For example, it may fail to detect the active phase of ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' infection because the specific anti-''Toxoplasma'' [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] or [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] may not be produced until after several weeks of infection. As a result, a pregnant woman might test negative during the active phase of ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' infection leading to undetected and therefore untreated congenital toxoplasmosis.<ref name="Lin_2000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin MH, Chen TC, Kuo TT, Tseng CC, Tseng CP | title = Real-time PCR for quantitative detection of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 4121–5 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11060078 | pmc = 87551 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.38.11.4121-4125.2000}}</ref> Also, the test may not detect ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' infections in immunocompromised patients because the titers of specific anti-''Toxoplasma'' IgG or IgM may not rise in this type of patient.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Many PCR-based techniques have been developed to diagnose toxoplasmosis using clinical specimens that include amniotic fluid, [[blood]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and [[tissue biopsy]]. The most sensitive PCR-based technique is [[nested PCR]], followed by hybridization of PCR products.<ref name="Lin_2000"/> The major downside to these techniques is that they are time-consuming and do not provide quantitative data.<ref name="Lin_2000"/>

Real-time PCR is useful in pathogen detection, gene expression and regulation, and allelic discrimination. This PCR technique utilizes the 5' nuclease activity of ''Taq'' DNA polymerase to cleave a nonextendible, fluorescence-labeled hybridization probe during the extension phase of PCR.<ref name="Lin_2000"/> A second fluorescent dye, e.g., 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine, quenches the fluorescence of the intact probe.<ref name="Lin_2000"/> The nuclease cleavage of the hybridization probe during the PCR releases the effect of quenching resulting in an increase of fluorescence proportional to the amount of PCR product, which can be monitored by a sequence detector.<ref name="Lin_2000"/>

Lymph nodes affected by ''Toxoplasma'' have characteristic changes, including poorly demarcated reactive [[germinal centers]], clusters of monocytoid B cells, and scattered epithelioid [[histiocyte]]s.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

The classic triad of congenital toxoplasmosis includes: [[chorioretinitis]], [[hydrocephalus]], and [[intracranial arteriosclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J|last2=Lopez|first2=A|last3=Wilson|first3=M|title=Congenital toxoplasmosis|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 May 2003|volume=67|issue=10|pages=2131–8|pmid=12776962}}</ref> Other consequences include sensorineural deafness, seizures, and intellectual disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001360.htm|title=Congenital toxoplasmosis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment is recommended for people with serious health problems, such as people with [[HIV]] whose [[CD4]] counts are under 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] is the drug of choice to prevent toxoplasmosis, but not for treating active disease.

===Acute===
The medications prescribed for acute toxoplasmosis are the following:{{cn|date=January 2023}}
* [[Pyrimethamine]] – an [[antimalarial medication]]
* [[Sulfadiazine]] – an [[antibiotic]] used in combination with pyrimethamine to treat toxoplasmosis
** Combination therapy is usually given with folic acid supplements to reduce incidence of [[thrombocytopaenia]].
** Combination therapy is most useful in the setting of HIV.
* [[Clindamycin]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rolston KV, Hoy J |title = Role of clindamycin in the treatment of central nervous system toxoplasmosis | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 83 |issue = 3 | pages = 551–554 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3661590 | doi=10.1016/0002-9343(87)90769-8}}</ref>
* [[Spiramycin]] – an antibiotic used most often for pregnant women to prevent the infection of their children.

(other antibiotics, such as [[minocycline]], have seen some use as a [[salvage therapy]]).

If infected during pregnancy, spiramycin is recommended in the first and early second trimesters while pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine and [[leucovorin]] is recommended in the late second and third trimesters.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDC – Toxoplasmosis – Resources for Health Professionals|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/health_professionals/index.html#tx|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=5 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126092819/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/health_professionals/index.html#tx|archive-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>

===Latent===
In people with latent toxoplasmosis, the cysts are immune to these treatments, as the antibiotics do not reach the [[bradyzoite]]s in sufficient concentration.

The medications prescribed for latent toxoplasmosis are:
* [[Atovaquone]] – an antibiotic that has been used to kill ''Toxoplasma'' cysts inside [[AIDS]] patients<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxoplasmosis – treatment key research |url=http://www.aidsmap.com/cms1032641.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071022085155/http://www.aidsmap.com/cms1032641.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-22 |date=2005-11-02 |publisher=NAM & aidsmap }}</ref>

===Congenital===
When a pregnant woman is diagnosed with acute toxoplasmosis, amniocentesis can be used to determine whether the fetus has been infected or not. When a pregnant woman develops acute toxoplasmosis, the [[tachyzoites]] have approximately a 30% chance of entering the placental tissue, and from there entering and infecting the fetus. As gestational age at the time of infection increases, the chance of fetal infection also increases.<ref name="Robert-GangneuxDarde2012">{{cite journal|last1=Robert-Gangneux|first1=F.|last2=Darde|first2=M.-L.|title=Epidemiology of and Diagnostic Strategies for Toxoplasmosis|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=25|issue=2|year=2012|pages=264–296|issn=0893-8512|doi=10.1128/CMR.05013-11|pmid=22491772|pmc=3346298}}</ref>

If the parasite has not yet reached the fetus, [[spiramycin]] can help to prevent placental transmission. If the fetus has been infected, the pregnant woman can be treated with [[pyrimethamine]] and [[sulfadiazine]], with [[folinic acid]], after the first trimester. They are treated after the first trimester because pyrimethamine has an antifolate effect, and lack of folic acid can interfere with [[Neural tube defect|fetal brain formation]] and cause [[thrombocytopaenia]].<ref name="JonesLopez2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones J, Lopez A, Wilson M |title=Congenital toxoplasmosis |journal=American Family Physician |volume=67 |issue=10 |pages=2131–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12776962 }}</ref> Infection in earlier gestational stages correlates with poorer fetal and neonatal outcomes, particularly when the infection is untreated.<ref name=McLeod2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=McLeod R, Kieffer F, Sautter M, Hosten T, Pelloux H |title=Why prevent, diagnose and treat congenital toxoplasmosis? |journal=Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=320–44 |year=2009 |pmid=19430661 |pmc=2735102 |doi= 10.1590/s0074-02762009000200029}}</ref>

''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' was first described in 1908 by Nicolle and Manceaux in Tunisia, and independently by Splendore in Brazil.<ref name=Ferguson_2009/> Splendore reported the [[protozoan]] in a rabbit, while Nicolle and Manceaux identified it in a North African rodent, the gundi ([[Ctenodactylus gundi]]).<ref name=Weiss_Dubey_2009 /> In 1909 Nicolle and Manceaux differentiated the protozoan from ''[[Leishmania]]''.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 /> Nicolle and Manceaux then named it ''Toxoplasma gondii'' after the curved shape of its infectious stage (Greek root {{lang|grc-Latn|toxon}} = bow).<ref name=Ferguson_2009 />

The first adult case of toxoplasmosis was reported in 1940 with no neurological signs. Pinkerton and Weinman reported the presence of ''Toxoplasma'' in a 22-year-old man from Peru who died from a subsequent bacterial infection and fever.<ref name=Weiss_Dubey_2009 />

In 1948, a serological dye test was created by Sabin and Feldman based on the ability of the patient's antibodies to alter staining of ''Toxoplasma''.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pamf.org/serology/clinicianguide.html#toxosero|title=Laboratory Tests For The Diagnosis Of Toxoplasmosis|publisher=Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223225426/http://www.pamf.org/serology/clinicianguide.html#toxosero|archive-date=2007-12-23}}</ref> The Sabin Feldman Dye Test is now the gold standard for identifying ''Toxoplasma'' infection.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 />

Transmission of ''Toxoplasma'' by eating raw or undercooked meat was demonstrated by Desmonts et al. in 1965 Paris.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 /> Desmonts observed that the therapeutic consumption of raw beef or horse meat in a [[tuberculosis]] hospital was associated with a 50% per year increase in ''Toxoplasma'' antibodies.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 /> This means that more ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' was being transmitted through the raw meat.

In 1974, Desmonts and Couvreur showed that infection during the first two trimesters produces most harm to the fetus, that transmission depended on when mothers were infected during pregnancy, that mothers with antibodies before pregnancy did not transmit the infection to the fetus, and that [[spiramycin]] lowered the transmission to the fetus.<ref name=Weiss_Dubey_2009 />

''Toxoplasma'' gained more attention in the 1970s with the rise of immune-suppressant treatment given after organ or bone marrow transplants and the [[AIDS]] epidemic of the 1980s.<ref name=Ferguson_2009 /> Patients with lowered immune system function are much more susceptible to disease.

The term ''crazy cat-lady syndrome'' draws on both stereotype and popular cultural reference. It was originated as instances of the aforementioned afflictions were noted amongst the populace. A [[cat lady]] is a cultural stereotype of a woman who compulsively [[Hoarding|hoards]] and dotes upon cats.

Although few studies have investigated the effects of AMPH on gene regulation (Table 1), current data suggest that AMPH acts at multiple levels to alter histone/DNA interaction and to recruit transcription factors which ultimately cause repression of some genes and activation of other genes. Importantly, some studies have also correlated the epigenetic regulation induced by AMPH with the behavioral outcomes caused by this drug, suggesting therefore that epigenetics remodeling underlies the behavioral changes induced by AMPH. If this proves to be true, the use of specific drugs that inhibit histone acetylation, methylation or DNA methylation might be an important therapeutic alternative to prevent and/or reverse AMPH addiction and mitigate the side effects generate by AMPH when used to treat ADHD. | pmid=27453897 | volume=2015}}</ref><ref name="pmid25486626">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker DM, Cates HM, Heller EA, Nestler EJ | title = Regulation of chromatin states by drugs of abuse | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 30 | pages = 112–121 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25486626 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2014.11.002 | pmc=4293340}}</ref><ref name="pmid23643695">{{cite journal|vauthors=Nestler EJ|title=Epigenetic mechanisms of drug addiction|journal=Neuropharmacology|volume=76|issue=Pt B|pages=259–268|date=January 2014|pmid=23643695|pmc=3766384|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.04.004|quote=Short-term increases in histone acetylation generally promote behavioral responses to the drugs, while sustained increases oppose cocaine's effects, based on the actions of systemic or intra-NAc administration of HDAC inhibitors.&nbsp;...  Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<p><!-- continuing quotation across paragraph break-->"G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.</p>}}</ref> Widespread [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone–lysine acetylation]] in cortical [[astrocytes]] appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by ''T.&nbsp;gondii''.<ref name="T.

=== Giant panda ===
''Toxoplasma gondii'' has been reported as the cause of death of a [[giant panda]] kept in a zoo in China, who died in 2014 of acute [[gastroenteritis]] and [[respiratory disease]].<ref name="MaWang2015">{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Hongyu|last2=Wang|first2=Zedong|last3=Wang|first3=Chengdong|last4=Li|first4=Caiwu|last5=Wei|first5=Feng|last6=Liu|first6=Quan|title=Fatal ''Toxoplasma gondii'' infection in the giant panda|journal=Parasite|volume=22|year=2015|pages=30|issn=1776-1042|doi=10.1051/parasite/2015030|pmid=26514595|url= http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2015/01/parasite150075/parasite150075.html|pmc=4626621|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101021328/http://www.parasite-journal.org/articles/parasite/full_html/2015/01/parasite150075/parasite150075.html|archive-date=2016-01-01}}</ref> Although seemingly [[anecdotal]], this report emphasizes that all warm-blooded species are likely to be infected by ''T.&nbsp;gondii'', including endangered species such as the giant panda.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

In most of the current studies where positive correlations have been found between ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' seropositivity tests are conducted after the onset of the examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite.<ref name="Flegr_2013">{{cite journal | author = Flegr J | title = Influence of latent ''Toxoplasma'' infection on human personality, physiology and morphology: pros and cons of the ''Toxoplasma''-human model in studying the manipulation hypothesis | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 216 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 127–33 | date = Jan 1, 2013 | pmid = 23225875 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.073635 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with ''T.&nbsp;gondii''; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between ''T.&nbsp;gondii'' infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits.<ref name="Flegr_2013" />
