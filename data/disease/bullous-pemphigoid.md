'''Bullous pemphigoid''' (a type of [[pemphigoid]]) is an [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune]] [[Itch|pruritic]] [[skin disease]] that typically occurs in people aged over 60, that may involve the formation of [[blisters]] ([[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]]) in the space between the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] and [[dermis|dermal]] [[Human skin|skin layers]]. It is classified as a [[type II hypersensitivity]] reaction, which involves formation of anti-[[hemidesmosome]] antibodies, causing a loss of [[keratinocyte]]s to [[basement membrane]] adhesion.

==Signs and symptoms==
Clinically, the earliest [[lesion]]s may appear as a [[hives]]-like red raised rash, but could also appear dermatitic, [[targetoid]], [[lichenoid eruption|lichenoid]], nodular, or even without a [[rash]] ([[Itch#Mechanism|essential pruritus]]).<ref name="pmid25617817">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cozzani E, Gasparini G, Burlando M, Drago F, Parodi A | title = Atypical presentations of bullous pemphigoid: Clinical and immunopathological aspects | journal = Autoimmunity Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 438–45 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25617817 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2015.01.006 }}</ref> Tense [[Skin condition#Primary lesions|bullae]] eventually erupt, most commonly at the inner thighs and upper arms, but the trunk and extremities are frequently both involved.

Several other skin diseases may have similar symptoms. However, [[milium (disease)|milia]] are more common with [[epidermolysis bullosa acquisita]], because of the deeper antigenic targets.  A more ring-like configuration with a central depression or centrally collapsed bullae may indicate [[Linear IgA bullous dermatosis|linear IgA disease]]. [[Nikolsky's sign]] is negative, unlike [[pemphigus vulgaris]], where it is positive.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seshadri|first=Divya|title=Acantholysis revisited: Back to basics|journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol|year=2013|volume=79|issue=1|pages=120–6|doi=10.4103/0378-6323.104688|pmid=23254748|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Causes ==
In most cases of bullous pemphigoid, no clear precipitating factors are identified.<ref name=Stanley /> Potential precipitating events that have been reported include exposure to ultraviolet light and radiation therapy.<ref name=Stanley /><ref name="Chan2011">{{Cite journal| first =Lawrence S. | last = Chan | name-list-style = vanc | title=Bullous Pemphigoid  | journal=EMedicine Reference | year=2011 |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1062391-clinical}}</ref> Onset of pemphigoid has also been associated with certain drugs, including [[furosemide]], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, [[DPP-4 inhibitors]], [[captopril]], [[penicillamine]], and antibiotics.<ref name="Chan2011"/>

==Pathophysiology==
The bullae are formed by an immune reaction, initiated by the formation of [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:bullous pemphigoid">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzsixzSz000079843zPzhtm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:bullous pemphigoid |access-date=2010-06-24 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> autoantibodies targeting [[dystonin]], also called bullous pemphigoid antigen 1,<ref name=dystonin>{{OMIM|113810|DYSTONIN; DST}}</ref> and/or [[Collagen XVII|type XVII collagen]], also called bullous pemphigoid antigen 2,<ref name=collogen>{{OMIM|113811|COLLAGEN, TYPE XVII, ALPHA-1; COL17A1}}</ref> which is a component of [[hemidesmosomes]]. A different form of dystonin is associated with neuropathy.<ref name=dystonin /> Following antibody targeting, a cascade of [[immunomodulator]]s results in a variable surge of immune cells, including [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]], [[lymphocyte]]s and [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] coming to the affected area.  Unclear events subsequently result in a separation along the [[dermoepidermal junction]] and eventually stretch bullae.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis consist of at least 2 positive results out of 3 criteria (2-out-of-3 rule): (1) pruritus and/or predominant cutaneous blisters, (2) linear IgG and/or C3c deposits (in an n- serrated pattern) by direct [[immunofluorescence]] microscopy (DIF) on a skin biopsy specimen, and (3) positive epidermal side staining by [[indirect immunofluorescence]] microscopy on human salt-split skin (IIF SSS) on a serum sample.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meijer JM, Diercks GF, de Lang EW, Pas HH, Jonkman MF | title = Assessment of diagnostic strategy for early recognition of bullous and nonbullous variants of pemphigoid. | journal = JAMA Dermatol | volume = 155 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–165 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.4390 | pmid = 30624575 | pmc = 6439538 | date = December 2018 }}</ref> Routine [[H&E stain]]ing or [[ELISA]] tests do not add value to initial diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Treatment==
Treatments include [[topical steroid]]s such as [[clobetasol]], and [[halobetasol]] which in some studies have proven to be equally effective as systemic, or pill, therapy and somewhat safer.<ref name=Stanley />  However, in difficult-to-manage or widespread cases, systemic [[prednisone]] and powerful steroid-free [[immunosuppressant]] medications, such as [[methotrexate]], [[azathioprine]] or [[mycophenolate mofetil]], may be appropriate.<ref name=Stanley /><ref name=AM /> Some of these medications have the potential for severe adverse effects such as kidney and liver damage, increased susceptibility to infections, and bone marrow suppression.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Singh |first=Sanjay |last2=Kirtschig |first2=Gudula |last3=Anchan |first3=Vinayak N. |last4=Chi |first4=Ching-Chi |last5=Taghipour |first5=Kathy |last6=Boyle |first6=Robert J. |last7=Murrell |first7=Dedee F. |date=2023-08-11 |title=Interventions for bullous pemphigoid |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37572360 |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=CD002292 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002292.pub4 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=10421473 |pmid=37572360}}</ref> Antibiotics such as [[tetracycline]] or [[erythromycin]] may also control the disease, particularly in patients who cannot use corticosteroids.<ref name=AM /> 

The anti-CD20 [[monoclonal antibody]] rituximab has been found to be effective in treating some otherwise refractory cases of pemphigoid.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamberts A, Euverman HI, Terra JB, Jonkman MF, Horváth B | title = Effectiveness and Safety of Rituximab in Recalcitrant Pemphigoid Diseases | language = en | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 9 | pages = 248 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29520266 | pmc = 5827539 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00248 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2010 (updated in 2023) meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials showed that oral steroids and potent topical steroids are effective treatments, although their use may be limited by side-effects, while lower doses of topical steroids are safe and effective for treatment of moderate bullous pemphigoid.<ref name=":0" />

IgA-mediated pemphigoid can often be difficult to treat even with usually effective medications such as rituximab.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = He Y, Shimoda M, Ono Y, Villalobos IB, Mitra A, Konia T, Grando SA, Zone JJ, Maverakis E | title = Persistence of Autoreactive IgA-Secreting B Cells Despite Multiple Immunosuppressive Medications Including Rituximab | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 646–50 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25901938 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.59 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Bulbous pemphigoid may be self-resolving in a period ranging from several months to many years even without treatment.<ref name=Stanley /> Poor general health related to old age is associated with a poorer prognosis.<ref name=Stanley />

==Epidemiology==
Very rarely seen in children, bullous and non-bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in people 70 years of age and older.<ref name=Stanley /> Its estimated frequency is seven to 14 cases per million per year, but has been reported to be as high as 472 cases per million per year in Scottish men older than 85.<ref name=Stanley />  At least one study indicates the incidence might be increasing in the United Kingdom.<ref name="pmid18614511">{{cite journal | vauthors = Langan SM, Smeeth L, Hubbard R, Fleming KM, Smith CJ, West J | title = Bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris--incidence and mortality in the UK: population based cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | pages = a180 | date = July 2008 | issue = 7662 | pmid = 18614511 | pmc = 2483869 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a180 }}</ref> Some sources report it affects men twice as frequently as women,<ref name=AM>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmedicine.com |title="Bullous Pemphigoid." Quick Answers to Medical Diagnosis and Therapy |access-date=2012-07-21}}</ref> while others report no difference between the sexes.<ref name=Stanley />

Many mammals can be affected, including [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[horse]]s, as well as humans. It is very rare in dogs; on average, three cases are diagnosed around the world each year.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Research==

Animal models of bullous pemphigoid have been developed using [[Genetically modified mouse|transgenic techniques]] to produce mice lacking the genes for the two known autoantigens, dystonin and collagen XVII.<ref name=dystonin /><ref name=collogen />
