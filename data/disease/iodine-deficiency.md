<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Iodine deficiency''' is a lack of the [[trace element]] [[iodine]], an [[essential nutrient]] in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. It may result in metabolic problems such as [[goiter]], sometimes as an [[endemic goiter]] as well as [[congenital iodine deficiency syndrome]] due to untreated [[congenital hypothyroidism]], which results in developmental delays and other health problems. Iodine deficiency is an important [[global health]] issue, especially for fertile and pregnant women. It is also a preventable cause of [[intellectual disability]].

<!-- Cause and diagnosis-->
[[Iodine]] is an essential [[mineral (nutrient)|dietary mineral]] for neurodevelopment among children.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|language=no|url=https://www.helsedirektoratet.no/rapporter/risiko-for-jodmangel-i-norge-identifisering-av-et-akutt-behov-for-tiltak/Risiko%20for%20jodmangel%20i%20Norge%20-%20Identifisering%20av%20et%20akutt%20behov%20for%20tiltak.pdf/_/attachment/inline/cf5bfe92-959f-42fc-8258-cc66c8d839e2:c5d0ab8c7c1bb456664ec681781e4914e51a0dd4/Risiko%20for%20jodmangel%20i%20Norge%20-%20Identifisering%20av%20et%20akutt%20behov%20for%20tiltak.pdf|title=Risiko For Jodmangel i Norge|date=June 2016|website=Ernæringsrådet}}</ref> The [[thyroid hormone]]s [[thyroxine]] and [[triiodothyronine]] contain iodine. In areas where there is little iodine in the diet, typically remote inland areas where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency is common. It is also common in mountainous regions of the world where food is grown in iodine-poor soil.

<!-- Prevention and treatment -->
Prevention includes adding small amounts of iodine to table salt, a product known as ''[[iodized salt]]''. Iodine compounds have also been added to other foodstuffs, such as flour, water and milk, in areas of deficiency.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Iodine Deficiency Disorders |url=http://www.thyroidmanager.org/chapter/the-iodine-deficiency-disorders/ |work=Thyroid Disease Manager |author1=Creswell J.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Goiter===
{{main|Goiter}}
A low amount of [[thyroxine]] (one of the two thyroid hormones) in the blood, due to lack of dietary iodine to make it, gives rise to high levels of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid gland to increase many biochemical processes; the cellular growth and proliferation can result in the characteristic swelling or hyperplasia of the thyroid gland, or goiter. In mild iodine deficiency, levels of triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) may be elevated in the presence of low levels of levothyroxine, as the body converts more of the levothyroxine to triiodothyronine as a compensation. Some such patients may have a goiter, without an elevated TSH. The introduction of iodized salt since the early 1900s has eliminated this condition in many affluent countries; however, in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and several [[Europe]]an countries, iodine deficiency is a significant public health problem.<ref name=pmid16175826>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson M, Takkouche B, Egli I, Allen HE, de Benoist B |title=Current global iodine status and progress over the last decade towards the elimination of iodine deficiency |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=83 |issue=7 |pages=518–25 |year=2005 |pmid=16175826 |pmc=2626287 }}</ref> It is more common in developing countries. Public health initiatives to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease have resulted in lower discretionary salt use at the table. Additionally, there is a trend towards consuming more processed foods in western countries.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The noniodized salt used in these foods means that people are less likely to obtain iodine from adding salt during cooking.

Goiter is said to be endemic when the prevalence in a population is > 5%, and in most cases goiter can be treated with iodine supplementation. If goiter is untreated for around five years, however, iodine supplementation or thyroxine treatment may not reduce the size of the thyroid gland because the thyroid is permanently damaged.

===Congenital iodine deficiency syndrome===
{{main|Congenital iodine deficiency syndrome}}

[[Congenital iodine deficiency syndrome]], previously known as ''cretinism'', is a condition associated with iodine deficiency and goiter, commonly characterised by mental deficiency, deafness, squint, disorders of stance and gait and stunted growth due to [[hypothyroidism]]. [[Paracelsus]] was the first to point out the relation between goitrous parents and their mentally disabled children.<ref>{{cite journal|url-access=subscription|url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/2/141|title= Paracelsus on What the Physician Should Know|author= T.E.C. Jr. |volume=54|issue=2|journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]|publisher= [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|access-date= 2008-12-05|date= August 1, 1974}}</ref>

As a result of restricted diet, isolation, intermarriage, etc., as well as low iodine content in their food, children often had peculiar stunted bodies and retarded mental faculties, a condition later known to be associated with [[thyroid hormone]] deficiency. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], in his 1754 ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', described these patients as "crétins". In French, the term "crétin des Alpes" also became current, since the condition was observed in remote [[valleys of the Alps]] in particular. The word ''cretin'' appeared in English in 1779.

While reporting recent progress towards overcoming iodine-deficiency disorders worldwide, ''[[The Lancet]]'' noted: "According to [[World Health Organization]], in 2007, nearly 2&nbsp;billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake, a third being of school age." A conclusion was made that the single most preventable cause of [[intellectual disability]] is that of iodine deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal| url        = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61009-0/fulltext| title      = Iodine deficiency—way to go yet| date       = 12 July 2008 | journal= [[The Lancet]]| volume     = 372 | issue = 9633 | pages= 88 |pmid=18620930| access-date = 2008-12-05| doi        = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61009-0| last1      = The Lancet| s2cid = 5416860}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

Iodine accounts for 65% of the molecular weight of T<sub>4</sub> and 59% of T<sub>3</sub>.  There is a total of 15–20&nbsp;mg of iodine in the human body, primarily concentrated in thyroid tissue and hormones. Thirty percent of iodine is distributed in other tissues, including the mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of these tissues, iodide enters directly by [[sodium-iodide symporter]] (NIS).

The diagnostic workup of a suspected iodine deficiency includes signs and symptoms as well as possible risk factors mentioned above. A 24-hour urine iodine collection is a useful [[medical test]], as approximately 90% of ingested iodine is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Lee2009>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/122714 |title=Iodine Deficiency |website=Medscape |author1=Stephanie L.

Recovery of less than 90% is taken to mean high retention, that is, iodine deficiency. The recovery may, however, be well less than 90% during pregnancy, and an intake of [[goitrogen]]s can alter the test results.<ref name="LordBralley2008-p107-108">{{cite book|author1=Richard S.

If a 24-hour urine collection is not practical, a random urine iodine-to-creatinine ratio can alternatively be used.<ref name=Lee2009/> However, the 24-hour test is found to be more reliable.<ref name="LordBralley2008-p106">{{cite book|author1=Richard S.

A general idea of whether a deficiency exists can be determined through a functional iodine test in the form of an iodine skin test. In this test, the skin is painted with an iodine solution: if the iodine patch disappears quickly, this is taken as a sign of iodine deficiency. However, no accepted norms exist on the expected time interval for the patch to disappear, and in persons with dark skin color the disappearance of the patch may be difficult to assess. If a urine test is taken shortly after, the results may be altered due to the iodine absorbed previously in a skin test.<ref name="LordBralley2008-p107-108"/>

==Treatment==
[[File:Iodine pills.jpg|thumb|Iodine supplements]]
Iodine deficiency is treated by ingestion of iodine salts, such as found in [[food supplement]]s. Mild cases may be treated by using [[iodized salt]] in daily food consumption, or drinking more milk, or eating egg yolks, and saltwater fish.  For a salt and/or [[animal product]] restricted diet, sea vegetables ([[kelp]], [[hijiki]], [[dulse]], [[nori]] (found in [[sushi]])) may be incorporated regularly into a diet as a good source of iodine.<ref name=Lee2009/> In more remote settings, [[iodized oil]] may be used.<ref name=WHO2008>{{cite book | title = WHO Model Formulary 2008 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-92-4-154765-9 | vauthors = ((World Health Organization)) | veditors = Stuart MC, Kouimtzi M, Hill SR | hdl = 10665/44053 | author-link = World Health Organization | publisher = World Health Organization | page=499 | hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Medeiros-Neto |first1=Geraldo |last2=Rubio |first2=Ileana G.S. |chapter=Iodine-Deficiency Disorders |title=Endocrinology: Adult and Pediatric |date=2016 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-18907-1.00091-3|page=1597|isbn=978-0-323-18907-1 }}</ref>

The recommended daily intake of iodine for non-pregnant adults is 150 [[microgram|μg]] for maintenance of normal thyroid function. In pregnant women, the amount increases to 220&nbsp;μg; in breastfeeding women, the amount is 290&nbsp;μg.<ref name=Lee2009/>

==Prognosis==
With iodine supplementation, goiters caused by iodine deficiency decrease in size in very young children and pregnant women. Generally, however, long-standing goiters caused by iodine deficiency respond with only small amounts of shrinkage after iodine supplementation, and patients are at risk for developing [[hyperthyroidism]].<ref name=Lee2009/>

Being pregnant while iodine-deficient additionally carries the risk of causing [[congenital iodine deficiency syndrome]] in the newborn. This disease can only be managed by lifelong administration of [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>).<ref name="pmid7596704">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chorazy PA, Himelhoch S, Hopwood NJ, Greger NG, Postellon DC | title = Persistent hypothyroidism in an infant receiving a soy formula: case report and review of the literature | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 96 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = 148–50 |date=July 1995 | pmid = 7596704 }}</ref>

Iodine deficiency resulting in goiter occurs in 187&nbsp;million people globally {{as of|2010|lc=y}} (2.7% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> Certain areas of the world, due to natural deficiency and unavailability of iodine, are severely affected by iodine deficiency, which affects approximately two billion people worldwide. It is particularly common in the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]], [[South-East Asia]] and [[Africa]]. Among other nations affected by iodine deficiency, [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Kazakhstan]] have begun taking action, while [[Russia]] has not. Successful campaigns for the adoption of the use of iodized salt require education of salt producers and sellers and a communication campaign directed at the public. The cost of adding iodine to salt is negligible—"Only a few cents a ton."<ref name="mcneill">[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html "In Raising the World's I.Q., the Secret's in the Salt"], article by Donald G.

Iodine deficiency has largely been confined to the developing world for several generations, but reductions in salt consumption and changes in dairy processing practices eliminating the use of iodine-based disinfectants have led to increasing prevalence of the condition in Australia and New Zealand in recent years.  A proposal to mandate the use of iodized salt in most commercial breadmaking was adopted in Australia in October 2009.<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/scienceandeducation/factsheets/factsheets/iodinefortification/ l "Iodine Fortification"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410230223/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/scienceandeducation/factsheets/factsheets/iodinefortification/ |date=2013-04-10 }}, article appearing on March 5, 2013, from ''Food Standards''.</ref> In a study of the United Kingdom published in 2011, almost 70% of test subjects were found to be iodine deficient.<ref name="UKdeficiency">{{cite journal|pmid=21640375|title=Iodine status of UK schoolgirls: a cross-sectional survey|journal=[[The Lancet]]|date=11 June 2011|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60693-4|volume=377|issue=9782|pages=2007–12|last1=Vanderpump|first1=M.

===Deficient populations===
In areas where there is little iodine in the diet, typically remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to [[hypothyroidism]], symptoms of which are extreme [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[goiter]], mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures.<ref>{{cite book|chapter = Endemic Goiter|title = Endocrinology & metabolism|first = Philip|last = Felig|author2=Frohman, Lawrence A.|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-07-022001-0|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AZUUGrp6yUgC&pg=RA1-PA351}}</ref>

Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable [[mental retardation]], a result which occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered [[hypothyroid]]ic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but as of March 2006, iodine deficiency remained a serious public health problem in the developing world.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_iodine.html|title = Micronutrients&nbsp;— Iodine, Iron and Vitamin A|publisher = UNICEF}}</ref>

Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. In Germany it has been estimated to cause a billion dollars in health care costs per year.<ref name="Patrick2008"/> A modelling analysis suggests universal iodine supplementation for pregnant women in England may save £199 (2013 UK pounds) to the health service per pregnant woman and save £4476 per pregnant woman in societal costs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Costs and benefits of iodine supplementation for pregnant women in a mildly to moderately iodine-deficient population: a modelling analysis|journal = The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology|date = 2015-01-01|doi = 10.1016/s2213-8587(15)00212-0|pmid = 26268911|first1 = Mark|last1 = Monahan|first2 = Kristien|last2 = Boelaert|first3 = Kate|last3 = Jolly|first4 = Shiao|last4 = Chan|first5 = Pelham|last5 = Barton|first6 = Tracy E|last6 = Roberts|volume=3|issue = 9|pages=715–722|url = http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/19751821/Full_draft_iodine_new_final_clean_version.pdf}}</ref>

Iodine deficiency was previously a common disease in Norway, because the content of iodine in the drinking water was low.  Before 1950 goiter was a widespread disease caused by iodine deficiency.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhi.no/ml/kosthold/fakta-om-jod/|title=Fakta om jod|language=no|trans-title=Facts about iodine|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|date=11 July 2018 |access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> Up to 80 per cent of the population were affected in inland areas. In the coastal communities, saltwater fish were an important part of the diet, and because of the presence of iodine in seawater, goiter was less common than in the inland districts. From the 1950s, Norwegians started adding iodine to dairy cow feed. Since milk was an essential part of the Norwegian diet, the incidence of goiter decreased in the population.<ref name=":1" />
