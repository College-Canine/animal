A '''lymphocyte''' is a type of [[white blood cell]] (leukocyte) in the [[immune system]] of [[gnathostomata|most vertebrates]].<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | last1 = Janeway | first1 = Charles | author-link = Charles Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark |last4=Shlomchik | name-list-style = vanc | title = Immunobiology |edition=5th | publisher = Garland Science | year=  2001 | location = New York and London| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}</ref> Lymphocytes include [[T cell]]s (for cell-mediated and cytotoxic [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]]), [[B cell]]s (for [[humoral immunity|humoral]], [[antibody]]-driven [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]]),<ref name="Reeba A.OmmanAmeet R.Kini*">{{cite book |last1=Omman |first1=Reeba A. |last2=Kini |first2=Ameet R. |editor1-last=Keohane |editor1-first=Elaine M. |editor2-last=Otto |editor2-first=Catherine N. |editor3-last=Walenga |editor3-first=Jeanine N. |title=Rodak's Hematology: Clinical Principles and Applications |date=2020 |publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis, Missouri |isbn=978-0-323-53045-3 |pages=117–135 |edition=6th |chapter=Leukocyte development, kinetics, and functions}}</ref><ref name="ScienceDirect 2014 pp. 203–214">{{cite book | title=Middleton's Allergy: Principles and Practice | date=2014| doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-08593-9.00013-9 | chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323085939000139 | access-date=22 July 2020 | pages=203–214 | last1=Cohn | first1=Lauren | last2=Hawrylowicz | first2=Catherine | last3=Ray | first3=Anuradha | isbn=9780323085939|edition=8th|chapter=Biology of Lymphocytes|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> and [[innate lymphoid cell]]s (ILCs; "innate T cell-like" cells involved in mucosal immunity and homeostasis), of which [[natural killer cell]]s are an important subtype (which functions in [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]], [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] [[innate immune system|innate immunity]]). They are the main type of cell found in [[lymph]], which prompted the name "lymphocyte" (with ''cyte'' meaning cell).<ref name="National Cancer Institute">{{cite web | title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms | website=National Cancer Institute | url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms | access-date=22 July 2020 | quote=A type of immune cell that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the blood and in lymph tissue.

==Types==
[[Image:Lymphocyte2.jpg|thumb|A stained lymphocyte surrounded by [[red blood cell]]s viewed using a [[light microscope]]]]
[[File:T cell nuclear dynamics.gif|thumb|4D live imaging of T cell nuclear dynamics viewed using [[holotomography]] microscopy]]
The three major types of lymphocyte are [[T cell]]s, [[B cell]]s and [[Natural killer cell|natural killer]] (NK) cells.<ref name="Reeba A.OmmanAmeet R.Kini*"/> Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus.

===T cells and B cells===
{{Main|T cell|B cell}}
T cells ([[thymus]] cells) and B cells ([[bone marrow]]- or [[bursa of Fabricius|bursa]]-derived cells{{efn|The process of B-cell maturation was elucidated in birds and the B most likely means "bursa-derived" referring to the [[bursa of Fabricius]].<ref>{{cite web|title=B Cell|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/b%20cell|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=28 October 2011}}</ref> However, in humans (who do not have that organ), the bone marrow makes B cells, and the B can serve as a reminder of '''b'''one marrow.}}) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in [[cell-mediated immunity]], whereas B cells are primarily responsible for [[humoral immunity]] (relating to [[antibody|antibodies]]). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific "non-self" antigens, during a process known as [[antigen presentation]]. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored maximally to eliminate specific [[pathogen]]s or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of [[antibody|antibodies]] which then neutralize foreign objects like [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. In response to pathogens some T cells, called ''[[T helper cell]]s'', produce [[cytokine]]s that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called ''[[cytotoxic T cell]]s'', produce toxic [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] that contain powerful [[enzyme]]s which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of ''memory cells''. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will "remember" each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

===Natural killer cells===
{{Main|Natural killer cell}}

NK cells are a part of the [[innate immune system]] and play a major role in defending the host from [[tumor]]s and [[virus|viral]]ly infected cells.<ref name="Reeba A.OmmanAmeet R.Kini*"/> NK cells modulate the functions of other cells, including [[macrophages]] and T cells,<ref name="Reeba A.OmmanAmeet R.Kini*"/> and distinguish infected cells and tumors from normal and uninfected cells by recognizing changes of a surface molecule called [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) [[MHC class I|class I]]. NK cells are activated in response to a family of [[cytokines]] called [[interferon]]s. Activated NK cells release [[cytotoxic]] (cell-killing) [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] which then destroy the altered cells.<ref name=Janeway/> They are named "natural killer cells" because they do not require prior activation in order to kill cells which are missing MHC class I.

===Dual expresser lymphocyte – X cell===
The X lymphocyte is a reported cell type expressing both a [[B-cell receptor]] and [[T-cell receptor]] and is hypothesized to be implicated in type 1 diabetes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Rizwan|last2=Omidian|first2=Zahra|last3=Giwa|first3=Adebola|last4=Cornwell|first4=Benjamin|last5=Majety|first5=Neha|last6=Bell|first6=David R.|last7=Lee|first7=Sangyun|last8=Zhang|first8=Hao|last9=Michels|first9=Aaron|last10=Desiderio|first10=Stephen|last11=Sadegh-Nasseri|first11=Scheherazade|date=30 May 2019|title=A Public BCR Present in a Unique Dual-Receptor-Expressing Lymphocyte from Type 1 Diabetes Patients Encodes a Potent T Cell Autoantigen|url= |journal=Cell|language=en|volume=177|issue=6|pages=1583–1599.e16|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.007|issn=0092-8674|pmid=31150624|pmc=7962621|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=30 May 2019|title=Newly Discovered Immune Cell Linked to Type 1 Diabetes|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/newly-discovered-immune-cell-linked-to-type-1-diabetes|access-date=9 August 2020|website=Johns Hopkins Medicine Newsroom|language=en}}</ref>  Its existence as a cell type has been challenged by two studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Japp |first1=Alberto |title=TCR+/BCR+ dual-expressing cells and their associated public BCR clonotype are not enriched in type 1 diabetes |journal=Cell |date=4 February 2021 |volume=184 |issue=3 |pages=827–839 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.035 |pmid=33545036 |pmc=8016147 |s2cid=231809927 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burel |first1=Julie |title=The Challenge of Distinguishing Cell–Cell Complexes from Singlet Cells in Non-Imaging Flow Cytometry and Single-Cell Sorting |journal=Cytometry Part A |date=13 May 2020 |volume=97 |issue=11 |pages=1127–1135 |doi=10.1002/cyto.a.24027 |pmid=32400942 |pmc=7666012 |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, the authors of original article pointed to the fact that the two studies have detected X cells by imaging microscopy and FACS as described.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Rizwan|last2=Omidian|first2=Zahra|last3=Giwa|first3=Adebola|last4=Donner|first4=Thomas|last5=Jie|first5=Chunfa|last6=Hamad|first6=Abdel Rahim A.|date=2021-02-04|title=A reply to "TCR+/BCR+ dual-expressing cells and their associated public BCR clonotype are not enriched in type 1 diabetes"|journal=Cell|volume=184|issue=3|pages=840–843|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.036|issn=1097-4172|pmc=7935028|pmid=33545037}}</ref> Additional studies are required to determine the nature and properties of X cells (also called dual expressers).

==Development==

T cells migrate to the blood stream and mature in a distinct primary organ, called the [[thymus]]. Following maturation, the lymphocytes enter the circulation and peripheral [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid organs]] (e.g. the [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]]) where they survey for invading [[pathogen]]s and/or tumor cells.

The lymphocytes involved in adaptive immunity (i.e. B and T cells) differentiate further after exposure to an [[antigen]]; they form effector and memory lymphocytes. Effector lymphocytes function to eliminate the antigen, either by releasing antibodies (in the case of B cells), cytotoxic granules ([[cytotoxic T cell]]s) or by signaling to other cells of the immune system ([[helper T cells]]). [[Memory T cells]] remain in the peripheral tissues and circulation for an extended time ready to respond to the same antigen upon future exposure; they live weeks to several years, which is very long compared to other leukocytes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Characteristics==
[[Image:SEM blood cells.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A scanning electron microscope image of normal circulating human blood showing [[red blood cell]]s, several types of [[white blood cell]]s including lymphocytes, a [[monocyte]], a [[neutrophil]] and many small disc-shaped [[platelet]]s]]

Microscopically, in a [[Wright's stain]]ed [[peripheral blood smear]], a normal lymphocyte has a large, dark-staining [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] with little to no [[eosinophilic]] cytoplasm. In normal situations, the coarse, dense nucleus of a lymphocyte is approximately the size of a [[red blood cell]] (about 7&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] in diameter).<ref name= Abbas/> Some lymphocytes show a clear [[perinuclear zone]] (or halo) around the nucleus or could exhibit a small clear zone to one side of the nucleus. [[Polyribosomes]] are a prominent feature in the lymphocytes and can be viewed with an [[electron microscope]]. The [[ribosomes]] are involved in [[protein synthesis]], allowing the generation of large quantities of [[cytokine]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s by these cells.

It is impossible to distinguish between T cells and B cells in a peripheral blood smear.<ref name= Abbas/> Normally, [[flow cytometry]] testing is used for specific lymphocyte population counts. This can be used to determine the percentage of lymphocytes that contain a particular combination of specific cell surface proteins, such as [[immunoglobulin]]s or [[cluster of differentiation]] (CD) markers or that produce particular proteins (for example, [[cytokine]]s using intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS)). In order to study the function of a lymphocyte by virtue of the proteins it generates, other scientific techniques like the [[ELISPOT]] or [[secretion assay]] techniques can be used.<ref name= Janeway/>

In the [[circulatory system]], they move from [[lymph node]] to lymph node.<ref name="ScienceDirect 2014 pp. 203–214"/><ref name="Al-Shura 2020 pp. 41–46">{{cite book | last=Al-Shura | first=Anika Niambi | title=Advanced Hematology in Integrated Cardiovascular Chinese Medicine | chapter=Lymphocytes | publisher=Elsevier | year=2020 | isbn=978-0-12-817572-9 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-817572-9.00007-0 | pages=41–46| s2cid=241913878 }}</ref> This contrasts with [[macrophages]], which are rather stationary in the nodes.

==Lymphocytes and disease==
{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}
[[File:Tuberculous lymph node with caseating granuloma 40X.jpg|thumb|Several lymphocytes seen collected around a tuberculous [[granuloma]]]]

A lymphocyte count is usually part of a peripheral [[complete blood cell count]] and is expressed as the percentage of lymphocytes to the total number of white blood cells counted.

A general increase in the number of lymphocytes is known as [[lymphocytosis]],<ref name="Cleveland Clinic II">{{cite web | title=Lymphocytosis: Symptoms, Causes, Treatments | website=Cleveland Clinic | url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17751-lymphocytosis | access-date=22 July 2020 }}</ref> whereas a decrease is known as [[lymphocytopenia]].

===High===
An increase in lymphocyte concentration is usually a sign of a [[viral infection]] (in some rare case, [[leukemia]]s are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person).<ref name="Cleveland Clinic II"/><ref name="Guilbert Gern Lemanske 2010 pp. 363–376">{{cite book | last1=Guilbert | first1=Theresa W. | last2=Gern | first2=James E. | last3=Lemanske | first3=Robert F. | title=Pediatric Allergy: Principles and Practice | chapter=Infections and Asthma | publisher=Elsevier | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4377-0271-2 | doi=10.1016/b978-1-4377-0271-2.00035-3 | pages=363–376 | s2cid=78707217 | quote=Lymphocytes are recruited into the upper and lower airways during the early stages of a viral respiratory infection, and it is presumed that these cells help to limit the extent of infection and to clear virus-infected epithelial cells.}}</ref> A high lymphocyte count with a low [[neutrophil]] count might be caused by [[lymphoma]]. [[Pertussis toxin]] (PTx) of ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per [[microlitre|μl]] in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.

==== Lymphoproliferative disorders ====
[[Lymphoproliferative disorder]]s (LPD) encompass a diverse group of diseases marked by uncontrolled lymphocyte production, leading to issues like lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and bone marrow infiltration. These disorders are common in immunocompromised individuals and involve abnormal proliferation of T and B cells, often resulting in immunodeficiency and immune system dysfunction. Various gene mutations, both iatrogenic and acquired, are implicated in LPD. One subtype, X-linked LPD, is linked to mutations in the X chromosome, predisposing individuals to natural killer cell LPD and T-cell LPD. Additionally, conditions like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and certain viral infections elevate the risk of LPD. Treatment methods, such as immunosuppressive drugs and tissue transplantation, can also increase susceptibility. LPDs encompass a wide array of disorders involving B-cell (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and T-cell (e.g., Sezary syndrome) abnormalities, each presenting distinct challenges in diagnosis and management.<ref>{{Citation |last=Justiz Vaillant |first=Angel A. |title=Lymphoproliferative Disorders |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537162/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-10-07 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30725847 |last2=Stang |first2=Christopher M.}}</ref>

===Low===

A low normal to low absolute lymphocyte concentration is associated with [[opportunistic infection|increased rates of infection after surgery or trauma]].<ref name="NathanClumeckStéphane deWit">{{cite book |first1=Nathan|last1= Clumeck|first2=Stéphane| last2=de Wit | title=Infectious Diseases | chapter=Prevention of opportunistic infections| date=2010| doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-04579-7.00090-3 | chapter-url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323045797000903 | access-date=5 January 2021 | pages=958–963 | isbn=9780323045797|s2cid= 78729807}}</ref>

One basis for low T cell lymphocytes occurs when the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infects and destroys T cells (specifically, the [[CD4]]<sup>+</sup> subgroup of T lymphocytes, which become helper T cells).<ref name="Wahed Quesada Dasgupta 2020 pp. 77–87">{{cite book | last1=Wahed | first1=Amer | last2=Quesada | first2=Andres | last3=Dasgupta | first3=Amitava | title=Hematology and Coagulation | chapter=Benign white blood cell and platelet disorders | publisher=Elsevier | year=2020 | isbn=978-0-12-814964-5 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-814964-5.00005-x | pages=77–87 | s2cid=241056897 | quote= Lymphocytopenia may also be acquired, for example, in patients with HIV infection.}}</ref> Without the key defense that these T cells provide, the body becomes susceptible to [[opportunistic infection]]s that otherwise would not affect healthy people. The extent of HIV progression is typically determined by measuring the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the patient's blood – HIV ultimately progresses to [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS). The effects of other [[virus]]es or lymphocyte disorders can also often be estimated by counting the numbers of lymphocytes present in the [[blood]].

===Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes===
{{Main|Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte}}

In some cancers, such as [[melanoma]] and [[colorectal cancer]], lymphocytes can migrate into and attack the [[tumor]]. This can sometimes lead to regression of the primary tumor.
