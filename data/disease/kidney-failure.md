== Classification ==
{{See also|Hepatorenal syndrome}}

Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: [[acute kidney failure]] or [[chronic kidney failure]]. The type of renal failure is differentiated by the trend in the serum [[Creatinine#Diagnostic use|creatinine]]; other factors that may help differentiate acute kidney failure from chronic kidney failure include [[anemia]] and the kidney size on [[sonography]] as chronic kidney disease generally leads to anemia and small kidney size.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

===Chronic kidney failure===
{{Main|Chronic kidney disease}}
[[File:CKD - Chronic kidney disease.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a kidney from a person with chronic renal failure]]

[[Chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) can also develop slowly and, initially, show few symptoms.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000471.htm |title=Chronic kidney disease |year=2011 |encyclopedia=A.D.A.M.

=== Acute-on-chronic kidney failure ===
Acute kidney injuries can be present on top of chronic kidney disease, a condition called acute-on-chronic kidney failure (AoCRF). The acute part of AoCRF may be reversible, and the goal of treatment, as with AKI, is to return the person to baseline kidney function, typically measured by serum [[creatinine]]. Like AKI, AoCRF can be difficult to distinguish from chronic kidney disease if the person has not been monitored by a [[physician]] and no baseline (i.e., past) blood work is available for comparison.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms can vary from person to person. Someone in early stage kidney disease may not feel sick or notice symptoms as they occur. When the kidneys fail to filter properly, waste accumulates in the blood and the body, a condition called [[azotemia]]. Very low levels of azotaemia may produce few, if any, symptoms. If the disease progresses, symptoms become noticeable (if the failure is of sufficient degree to cause symptoms). Kidney failure accompanied by noticeable symptoms is termed [[uraemia]].<ref name="grinsted">{{cite web  | vauthors = Grinsted P | title = Kidney failure (renal failure with uremia, or azotaemia)  | date = 2005-03-02  | url = http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/kidneyfailure.htm  | access-date = 2009-05-26}}</ref>

* Healthy kidneys produce the hormone [[erythropoietin]] that stimulates the [[bone marrow]] to [[Haematopoiesis|make oxygen-carrying red blood cells]]. As the kidneys fail, they produce less erythropoietin, resulting in decreased production of red blood cells to replace the natural breakdown of old red blood cells. As a result, the blood carries less [[hemoglobin]], a condition known as [[anemia]]. This can result in:
** Feeling tired or weak
** Memory problems
** Difficulty concentrating
** [[Dizziness]]
** Low blood pressure
* Normally proteins are too large to pass through the kidneys. However they are able to pass through when the glomeruli are damaged.

== Causes ==

=== Acute kidney injury ===
{{Main|Acute kidney injury}}
Acute kidney injury (previously known as acute renal failure) – or AKI – usually occurs when the blood supply to the kidneys is suddenly interrupted or when the kidneys become overloaded with toxins. Causes of acute kidney injury include accidents, injuries, or complications from surgeries in which the kidneys are deprived of normal blood flow for extended periods of time. Heart-bypass surgery is an example of one such procedure.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Drug overdoses, accidental or from chemical overloads of drugs such as antibiotics or chemotherapy, along with bee stings<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva GB, Vasconcelos AG, Rocha AM, Vasconcelos VR, Barros J, Fujishima JS, Ferreira NB, Barros EJ, Daher EF | display-authors = 6 | title = Acute kidney injury complicating bee stings - a review | journal = Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo | volume = 59 | pages = e25 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28591253 | pmc = 5459532 | doi = 10.1590/S1678-9946201759025 }}</ref> may also cause the onset of acute kidney injury. Unlike chronic kidney disease, however, the kidneys can often recover from acute kidney injury, allowing the person with AKI to resume a normal life. People with acute kidney injury require supportive treatment until their kidneys recover function, and they often remain at increased risk of developing future kidney failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/Kudiseases/pubs/yourkidneys/#7 |title=The Kidneys and How They Work |author=National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse |year=2012 |publisher=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |access-date=1 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502081848/http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/Kudiseases/pubs/yourkidneys/#7 |archive-date=2 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Among the accidental causes of renal failure is the [[crush syndrome]], when large amounts of [[toxin]]s are suddenly released in the [[blood circulation]] after a long compressed [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] is suddenly relieved from the pressure obstructing the blood flow through its tissues, causing [[Kidney Ischemia|ischemia]]. The resulting overload can lead to the clogging and the destruction of the kidneys. It is a [[reperfusion injury]] that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products – notably [[myoglobin]], [[potassium]], and [[phosphorus]] – that are the products of [[rhabdomyolysis]] (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by [[ischemia|ischemic]] conditions). The specific action on the [[kidney]]s is not fully understood, but may be due in part to [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] [[metabolite]]s of myoglobin.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

=== Chronic kidney failure ===
{{Main|Chronic kidney disease}}
Chronic kidney failure has numerous causes. The most common causes of chronic failure are [[diabetes mellitus]] and long-term, uncontrolled [[hypertension]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kes P, Basić-Jukić N, Ljutić D, Brunetta-Gavranić B | title = [The role of arterial hypertension in development of chronic renal failure] | language = hr | journal = Acta Medica Croatica | volume = 65 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = 78–84 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 23120821 | url = http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf | url-status = dead | trans-title = The role of arterial hypertension in the development of chronic renal failure | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130719135947/http://www.amzh.hr/amc/pdf/amc_2011%20vol%2065%20supplement%203.pdf | archive-date = 2013-07-19 }}</ref> [[Polycystic kidney disease]] is another well-known cause of chronic failure. The majority of people affected with polycystic kidney disease have a family history of the disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also a known cause of chronic kidney failure. Other genetic illnesses cause kidney failure, as well.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Overuse of common drugs such as [[ibuprofen]], and [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) can also cause chronic kidney failure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perneger TV, Whelton PK, Klag MJ | title = Risk of kidney failure associated with the use of acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 331 | issue = 25 | pages = 1675–9 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7969358 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199412223312502 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Diagnostic approach ==

=== Measurement for CKD ===
;Stages of kidney failure

Chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages, which are calculated using the person's GFR, or [[glomerular filtration rate]]. Stage 1 CKD is mildly diminished renal function, with few overt symptoms. Stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction. People with stage 4 and 5 kidney failure usually require preparation towards active treatment in order to survive. [[Chronic kidney disease|Stage 5 CKD]] is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy ([[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]]) or [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] whenever feasible.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

;Glomerular filtration rate

A normal GFR varies according to many factors, including sex, age, body size and ethnic background. Renal professionals consider the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to be the best overall index of kidney function.<ref>Fadem, Stephen Z., M.D., [http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr_calculator.cfm FACP, FASN. Calculators for HealthCare Professionals. National Kidney Foundation. 13 Oct 2008]</ref> [[The National Kidney Foundation]] offers an easy to use on-line GFR calculator<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/gfr_calculator.cfm |title=GFR calculator |publisher=Kidney.org |access-date=2011-09-25}}</ref> for anyone who is interested in knowing their glomerular filtration rate. (A serum [[creatinine]] level, a simple blood test, is needed to use the calculator.)

=== Use of the term ''uremia'' ===
Before the advancement of modern medicine, renal failure was often referred to as uremic poisoning. Uremia was the term for the contamination of the blood with urea. It is the presence of an excessive amount of urea in blood. Starting around 1847, this included reduced urine output, which was thought to be caused by the urine mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The term ''[[uremia]]'' is now used for the illness accompanying kidney failure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer TW, Hostetter TH | title = Uremia | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 13 | pages = 1316–25 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17898101 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra071313 }}</ref>

=== Renal failure index ===
Two other urinary indices, are the [[fractional sodium excretion]] (FENa) index and the renal failure index (RFI).<ref name="Web">{{cite web |title=Urinary indices - fractional excretion of sodium ( FENA ), renal failure index. Acute tubular necrosis |url=http://www.globalrph.com/urinary_indices.htm}}</ref> The renal failure index is equal to urine sodium times plasma creatinine divided by urine [[creatinine]].<ref name="Web" /> A FENa score greater than 3% or a renal failure index (RFI) greater than 3 are helpful in confirming acute renal failure.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Stapleton |first1=F.

== Complications ==
Those with end stage renal failure who undergo haemodialysis have higher risk of spontaneous intra-abdominal bleeding than the general population (21.2%) and [[Intestinal ischemia|non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia]] (18.1%). Meanwhile, those undergoing [[peritoneal dialysis]] have a higher chance of developing [[peritonitis]] and [[gastrointestinal perforation]]. However, the rate of [[acute pancreatitis]] does not differ from the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonolini M, Ierardi AM, Carrafiello G | title = Letter to the editor: spontaneous renal haemorrhage in end-stage renal disease | journal = Insights into Imaging | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 693–695 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26472545 | pmc = 4656237 | doi = 10.1007/s13244-015-0439-4 }}</ref>

== Treatment ==

The treatment of acute kidney injury depends on the cause.<ref name=Clat2010/> The treatment of chronic kidney failure may include renal replacement therapy: [[hemodialysis]], [[peritoneal dialysis]], or [[kidney transplant]].<ref name=NIH2017/>

=== Diet ===
In non-diabetics and people with [[type 1 diabetes]], a low protein diet is found to have a preventive effect on progression of chronic kidney disease. However, this effect does not apply to people with [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rughooputh MS, Zeng R, Yao Y | title = Protein Diet Restriction Slows Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Non-Diabetic and in Type 1 Diabetic Patients, but Not in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Using Glomerular Filtration Rate as a Surrogate | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = e0145505 | date = 28 December 2015 | pmid = 26710078 | pmc = 4692386 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145505 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1045505R | doi-access = free }}</ref> A whole food, [[plant-based diet]] may help some people with kidney disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chauveau P, Combe C, Fouque D, Aparicio M | title = Vegetarianism: advantages and drawbacks in patients with chronic kidney diseases | journal = Journal of Renal Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 399–405 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24070587 | doi = 10.1053/j.jrn.2013.08.004 }}</ref> A high protein diet from either animal or plant sources appears to have negative effects on kidney function at least in the short term.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein AM, Treyzon L, Li Z | title = Are high-protein, vegetable-based diets safe for kidney function?

=== Slowing progression ===
People who receive earlier referrals to a nephrology specialist, meaning a longer time before they must start dialysis, have a shorter initial hospitalization and reduced risk of death after the start of dialysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smart NA, Dieberg G, Ladhani M, Titus T | title = Early referral to specialist nephrology services for preventing the progression to end-stage kidney disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD007333 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24938824 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007333.pub2 }}</ref> Other methods of reducing disease progression include minimizing exposure to [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxins]] such as [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] and [[Radiocontrast agent|intravenous contrast]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?aid=1145435499|title=Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2018| vauthors = Dirkx TC, Woodell T, Watnick S |date=2017|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education| veditors = Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ, Rabow MW |location=New York, NY}}</ref>
