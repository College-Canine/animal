'''Aminoglycoside''' is a [[medicinal chemistry|medicinal]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriologic]] category of traditional [[Gram-negative]] [[antibacterial]] [[medication]]s that inhibit protein synthesis and contain as a portion of the molecule an amino-modified [[glycoside]] ([[sugar]]).<ref>E.g., see www.merriam-webster.com/medical/aminoglycoside: "any of a group of antibiotics (as streptomycin and neomycin) that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and are active especially against gram-negative bacteria".</ref><ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mingeot-Leclercq MP, Glupczynski Y, Tulkens PM |title=Aminoglycosides: activity and resistance |journal=Antimicrob.

[[Streptomycin]] is the first-in-class aminoglycoside [[antibiotic]]. It is derived from ''Streptomyces griseus'' and is the earliest modern agent used against [[tuberculosis]]. Streptomycin lacks the common 2-deoxystreptamine moiety (image right, below) present in most other members of this class. Other examples of aminoglycosides include the deoxystreptamine-containing agents [[kanamycin]], [[tobramycin]], [[gentamicin]], and [[neomycin]] (see below).

Aminoglycosides display concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against "most gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacilli" but not against gram-negative anaerobes and most gram-positive bacteria.<ref name="merckmanuals.com"/> They require only short contact time, and are most effective against susceptible bacterial populations that are rapidly multiplying.<ref name="DVM Boothe, DVM 2012">DVM Boothe, DVM, PhD, 2012, Aminoglycosides (Aminocyclitols), The Merck Veterinary Manual {{cite web|url=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/antibacterial-agents/aminoglycosides |title=Aminoglycosides: Antibacterial Agents: Merck Veterinary Manual |access-date=2014-02-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301061340/http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/pharmacology/antibacterial_agents/aminoglycosides.html |archive-date=2014-03-01 }}, accessed 22 February 2014.</ref> These activities are attributed to a primary mode of action as [[protein synthesis inhibitor]]s, though additional mechanisms are implicated for some specific agents, and/or thorough mechanistic descriptions are as yet unavailable.<ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999"/><ref name="merckmanuals.com"/><ref name="DVM Boothe, DVM 2012"/>

The inhibition of protein synthesis is mediated through aminoglycosides' energy-dependent, sometimes irreversible binding, to the [[cytosol]]ic, membrane-associated bacterial [[ribosome]] (image at right).<ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999"/> (Aminoglycosides first cross bacterial cell walls—[[lipopolysaccharide]] in gram-negative bacteria—and cell membranes, where they are [[active transport|actively transported]].<ref name="DVM Boothe, DVM 2012"/>) While specific steps in protein synthesis affected may vary somewhat between specific aminoglycoside agents, as can their affinity and degree of binding,<ref name="DVM Boothe, DVM 2012"/> aminoglycoside presence in the cytosol generally disturbs peptide elongation at the [[30S]] [[ribosome|ribosomal]] subunit, giving rise to inaccurate mRNA translation and therefore biosynthesis of proteins that are truncated, or bear altered amino acid compositions at particular points.<ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999"/> Specifically, binding impairs [[proofreading (biology)|translational proofreading]] leading to misreading of the RNA message, premature termination, or both, and so to inaccuracy of the [[Translation (biology)|translated]] protein product. The subset of aberrant proteins that are incorporated into the bacterial cell membrane may then lead to changes in its permeability and then to "further stimulation of aminoglycoside transport".<ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999"/> The [[amino sugar]] portion of this class of molecules (e.g., the 2-deoxystreptamine in kanamycins, gentamicins, and tobramycin, see above) are implicated in the association of the small molecule with ribosomal structures that lead to the infidelities in translation (ibid.). Inhibition of [[bacterial translation#Elongation|ribosomal translocation]]—i.e., movement of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A- to the P-site—has also been suggested{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Recent single-molecule tracking experiments in live ''E. coli'' showed an ongoing but slower protein synthesis upon treatment with different aminoglycoside drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aguirre Rivera|first1=Javier|date=2021|title=Real-time measurements of aminoglycoside effects on protein synthesis in live cells|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=118|issue=9|pages=e2013315118|doi=10.1073/pnas.2013315118|pmid=33619089|pmc=7936356|bibcode=2021PNAS..11813315A |doi-access=free}}</ref> ([[Spectinomycin]], a related but distinct chemical structure class often discussed with aminoglycosides, does not induce mRNA misreading and is generally not bactericidal.)<ref name="DVM Boothe, DVM 2012"/>

It has been proposed that aminoglycoside antibiotics cause oxidation of guanine nucleotides in the bacterial nucleotide pool, and that this contributes to the cytotoxicity of these antibiotics.<ref name = Foti2012>Foti JJ, Devadoss B, Winkler JA, Collins JJ, Walker GC. Oxidation of the guanine nucleotide pool underlies cell death by bactericidal antibiotics. Science. 2012 Apr 20;336(6079):315-9. doi: 10.1126/science.1219192. PMID 22517853; PMCID: PMC3357493</ref>  The incorporation of oxidized guanine nucleotides into [[DNA]] could be bactericidal since incomplete repair of closely spaced [[8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine]]  in the DNA can result in lethal double-strand breaks.<ref name = Foti2012/>

Finally, a further "cell-membrane effect" also occurs with aminoglycosides; "functional integrity of the bacterial cell membrane" can be lost, later in time courses of aminoglycoside exposure and transport.<ref>As Boothe notes, "high concentrations of aminoglycosides may cause nonspecific membrane toxicity, even to the point of bacterial cell lysis", though the physiologic relevance of these concentrations to specific clinical situations is unclear.

===Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics===
There is a significant variability in the relationship between the dose administered and the resultant plasma level in blood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Therapeutic drug monitoring]] (TDM) is necessary to obtain the correct dose. These agents exhibit a [[Post Antibiotic Effect|post-antibiotic effect]] in which there is no or very little drug level detectable in blood, but there still seems to be inhibition of bacterial re-growth. This is due to strong, irreversible binding to the ribosome, and remains intracellular long after plasma levels drop, and allows a prolonged dosage interval.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Depending on their concentration, they act as [[bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] or [[bactericide|bactericidal]] agents.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aminoglycosides - Infectious Diseases|url=https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/bacteria-and-antibacterial-drugs/aminoglycosides|access-date=2021-12-14|website=MSD Manual Professional Edition|language=en}}</ref>

===Indications===
Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving [[aerobic organism|aerobic]], [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter]]'', and ''[[Enterobacter]]''. In addition, some ''[[Mycobacteria]]'', including the bacteria that cause [[tuberculosis]], are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Streptomycin was the first effective drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, though the role of aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and amikacin has been eclipsed (because of their toxicity and inconvenient route of administration) except for multiple-drug-resistant strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The most frequent use of aminoglycosides is empiric therapy for serious infections such as [[sepsis]], complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Usually, once cultures of the causal organism are grown and their susceptibilities tested, aminoglycosides are discontinued in favor of less toxic antibiotics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

As noted, aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and viruses.<ref name="M-P Mingeot-Leclercq 1999"/> Infections caused by [[Gram-positive]] bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, but other types of antibiotics are more potent and less damaging to the host. In the past, the aminoglycosides have been used in conjunction with beta-lactam antibiotics in streptococcal infections for their synergistic effects, in particular in [[endocarditis]]. One of the most frequent combinations is [[ampicillin]] (a [[beta-lactam]], or penicillin-related antibiotic) and gentamicin. Often, hospital staff refer to this combination as "amp and gent" or more recently called "pen and gent" for penicillin and gentamicin.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Nonsense suppression===
The interference with mRNA proofreading has been exploited to treat genetic diseases that result from premature [[stop codons]] (leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins). Aminoglycosides can cause the cell to overcome the stop codons, insert a random amino acid, and express a full-length protein.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feero |first1=W. Gregory |last2=Guttmacher |first2=Alan E. |last3=Dietz |first3=Harry C. |s2cid=5809127 |title=New Therapeutic Approaches to Mendelian Disorders |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=363 |issue=9 |pages=852–63 |year=2010 |pmid=20818846 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0907180|doi-access=free }}</ref> The aminoglycoside [[gentamicin]] has been used to treat [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF) cells in the laboratory to induce them to grow full-length proteins. CF is caused by a mutation in the [[gene]] coding for the ''[[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]]'' (''CFTR'') protein. In approximately 10% of CF cases, the mutation in this gene causes its early termination during [[translation (biology)|translation]], leading to the formation of a truncated and non-functional CFTR protein. It is believed that [[gentamicin]] distorts the structure of the ribosome-RNA complex, leading to a mis-reading of the [[stop codon|termination codon]], causing the [[ribosome]] to "skip" over the stop sequence and to continue with the normal elongation and production of the CFTR protein.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wilschanski |first1=Michael |last2=Yahav |first2=Yaacov |last3=Yaacov |first3=Yasmin |last4=Blau |first4=Hannah |last5=Bentur |first5=Lea |last6=Rivlin |first6=Joseph |last7=Aviram |first7=Micha |last8=Bdolah-Abram |first8=Tali |last9=Bebok |first9=Zsuzsa |display-authors=8|title=Gentamicin-Induced Correction of CFTR Function in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and CFTR Stop Mutations |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=349 |issue=15 |pages=1433–41 |year=2003 |pmid=14534336 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa022170|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Routes of administration==
Since they are not absorbed from the gut, they are administered [[intravenous]]ly and [[intramuscular]]ly. Some are used in topical preparations for wounds. Oral administration can be used for gut decontamination (e.g., in hepatic encephalopathy). Tobramycin may be administered in a nebulized form.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pai VB, Nahata MC |title=Efficacy and safety of aerosolized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis |journal=Pediatr. Pulmonol. |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=314–27 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11568993 |doi= 10.1002/ppul.1125|s2cid=30108514 }}</ref>

==Clinical use==
The recent emergence of infections due to Gram-negative bacterial strains with advanced patterns of [[antimicrobial resistance]] has prompted physicians to reevaluate the use of these antibacterial agents.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Falagas |first1=Matthew E |last2=Grammatikos |first2=Alexandros P |last3=Michalopoulos |first3=Argyris |title=Potential of old-generation antibiotics to address current need for new antibiotics |journal=Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=593–600 |year=2008 |pmid=18847400 |doi=10.1586/14787210.6.5.593|s2cid=13158593 }}</ref> This revived interest in the use of aminoglycosides has brought back to light the debate on the two major issues related to these compounds, namely the spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility and toxicity. Current evidence shows that aminoglycosides do retain activity against the majority of Gram-negative clinical bacterial [[isolation (microbiology)|isolate]]s in many parts of the world. Still, the relatively frequent occurrence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity during aminoglycoside treatment makes physicians reluctant to use these compounds in everyday practice. Recent advances in the understanding of the effect of various dosage schedules of aminoglycosides on toxicity have provided a partial solution to this problem, although more research still needs to be done in order to overcome this problem entirely.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Durante-Mangoni |first1=Emanuele |last2=Grammatikos |first2=Alexandros |last3=Utili |first3=Riccardo |last4=Falagas |first4=Matthew E. |title=Do we still need the aminoglycosides? |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=201–5 |year=2009 |pmid=18976888 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.09.001}}</ref>
