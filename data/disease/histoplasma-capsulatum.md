'''''Histoplasma capsulatum''''' is a species of [[dimorphic fungus]].  Its sexual form is called '''''Ajellomyces capsulatus'''''.  It can cause pulmonary and disseminated [[histoplasmosis]].

''Histoplasma capsulatum'' is "distributed worldwide, except in Antarctica, but most often associated with [[Valley#River valleys|river valleys]]"<ref name="CDC_Yellow_Book_2016_Histoplasmosis">{{Citation |last=Chiller |first=Tom M. |year=2016 |title=Histoplasmosis |work=CDC Yellow Book: CDC Health Information for International Travel |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/histoplasmosis |postscript=.}}</ref> and occurs chiefly in the "[[central United States|Central]] and [[Eastern United States]]"<ref name="CDC_Fungal_Diseases">{{Citation |author=CDC |authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2014 |title=Fungal Diseases > Global fungal diseases > Preventing Deaths from Histoplasmosis |url=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/global/histoplasmosis.html |postscript=.}}</ref> followed by "[[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and other areas of the world".<ref name="CDC_Fungal_Diseases"/> It is most prevalent in the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi]] River valleys. It was discovered by [[Samuel Taylor Darling]] in 1906.

==Growth and morphology==
''Histoplasma capsulatum'' is an ascomycetous fungus closely related to ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]''. It is potentially sexual, and its sexual state, ''Ajellomyces capsulatus'', can readily be produced in culture, though it has not been directly observed in nature. ''H. capsulatum'' groups with ''B. dermatitidis'' and the [[South America]]n pathogen ''[[Paracoccidioides brasiliensis]]'' in the recently recognized fungal family [[Ajellomycetaceae]].<ref name=untereiner2002 /><ref name=untereiner2004 /> It is dimorphic and switches from a mould-like (filamentous) growth form in the natural habitat to a small, budding [[yeast]] form in the warm-blooded animal host.

Like ''B. dermatitidis'', ''H. capsulatum'' has two mating types, "+" and "–". The great majority of North American isolates belongs to a single genetic type,<ref name= karimi2002 /><ref name=kasuga2003 /> but a study of multiple genes suggests a recombining, sexual population.<ref name=kasuga2003 /> A recent analysis has suggested that the prevalent North American genetic type and a less common type should be considered separate phylogenetic species, distinct from ''H. capsulatum'' isolates obtained in Central and South America and other parts of the world. These entities are temporarily designated NAm1 (the rare type, which includes a famous experimental isolate designated "the Downs strain") and NAm2 (the common type).<ref name=kasuga2003 /> As yet, no well-established clinical or geographic distinction is seen between these two genetic groups.

In its asexual form, the fungus grows as a colonial microfungus strongly similar in macromorphology to ''B. dermatitidis''. A microscopic examination shows a marked distinction: ''H. capsulatum'' produces two types of conidia, globose macroconidia, 8–15&nbsp;μm, with distinctive tuberculate or finger-like cell wall ornamentation, and ovoid microconidia, 2–4&nbsp;μm, which appear smooth or finely roughened. Whether either of these conidial types is the principal infectious particle is unclear. They form on individual short stalks and readily become airborne when the colony is disturbed. Ascomata of the sexual state are 80–250&nbsp;μm, and are very similar in appearance and anatomy to those described above for ''B. dermatitidis''. The ascospores are similarly minute, averaging 1.5&nbsp;μm.

The budding yeast cells formed in infected tissues are small (about 2–4&nbsp;μm) and are characteristically seen forming in clusters within phagocytic cells, including [[histiocyte]]s and other macrophages, as well as monocytes. An African phylogenetic species, ''[[Histoplasma duboisii|H. duboisii]]'', often forms larger yeast cells to 15&nbsp;μm.

==Geographic distribution==
''Histoplasma capsulatum'' is "distributed worldwide, except in Antarctica, but most often associated with [[Valley#River valleys|river valleys]]"<ref name="CDC_Yellow_Book_2016_Histoplasmosis"/> and occurs chiefly in the "Central and Eastern United States"<ref name="CDC_Fungal_Diseases"/> followed by "Central and South America, and other areas of the world"<ref name="CDC_Fungal_Diseases"/> It is most prevalent in the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi]] river valleys.

The [[enzootic]] and [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones of ''H. capsulatum'' can be roughly divided into core areas, where the fungus occurs widely in soil or on vegetation contaminated by bird droppings or equivalent organic inputs, and peripheral areas, where the fungus occurs relatively rarely in association with soil, but is still found abundantly in heavy accumulations of bat or bird guano in enclosed spaces such as caves, buildings, and hollow trees. The principal core area for this species includes the valleys of the Mississippi, Ohio, and [[Potomac River]]s in the USA, as well as a wide span of adjacent areas extending from [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]] in the north to [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]] in the south.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=chamany2004 /><ref name=stobierski1996 /> In some areas, such as [[Kansas City]], skin testing with the histoplasmin antigen preparation shows that 80–90% of the resident population have an antibody reaction to ''H. capsulatum'', probably indicating prior subclinical infection.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Northern U.S. states such as [[Minnesota]], [[Michigan]], New York and [[Vermont]] are peripheral areas for histoplasmosis, but have scattered counties where 5–19% of lifetime residents show exposure to ''H. capsulatum''. One [[New York (state)|New York]] county, St. Lawrence county (across the [[St. Lawrence River]] from the [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]– [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]] – [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]] area of [[Ontario, Canada]]) shows exposures over 20%.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 />

The distribution of ''H. capsulatum'' in Canada is not as well documented as in the US. The St. Lawrence Valley is probably the best known endemic region based both on case reports and on a number of skin test reaction studies that were done between 1945 and 1970. The [[Montreal]] area is a particularly well documented endemic focus, not just in the agricultural regions surrounding the city<ref name=guy1949b /> but also within the city itself.<ref name=leznoff1969 /> The [[Mount Royal]] area in central Montreal, especially the north and east sides of Mt. Royal Park, showed exposure rates between 20 and 50% in schoolchildren<ref name=leznoff1969 /> and locally lifetime-resident university students.<ref name=maceachern1971 /> A particularly high rate of 79.3% exposure was shown in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], south of [[London, Ontario]], after 7 local residents had died of histoplasmosis in 1957.<ref name=haggar1957 /> Based on numerous small regional studies, histoplasmin skin test reactors form ca. 10–50&nbsp;% of the population in much of southern Ontario and in Quebec’s St. Lawrence Valley, ca. 5% in southern Manitoba and some northerly parts of [[Quebec]] (e.g., [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]]), and ca. 1% in [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=maceachern1971 /><ref name=haggar1957 /><ref name=rostocka1966 /><ref name=hoff1970 /><ref name=mochi1952 /> Exposure of aboriginal Canadians occurs remarkably far north in Quebec,<ref name=guy1949a /><ref name=schaefer1966 /> but has not been reported in similar boreal biogeoclimatic zones in many other parts of Canada. Recently and remarkably, a cluster of four indigenously acquired cases of histoplasmosis was shown to be associated with a golf course in suburban [[Edmonton, Alberta]].<ref name=anderson2006 /> Examination suggested that local soil was the source.

==Spectrum of disease==
Histoplasmosis is usually a subclinical infection that does not come to the attention of the person involved. The organism tends to remain alive in the scattered pulmonary calcifications; therefore, some cases are detected by emergence of serious infection when a patient becomes immunocompromised, perhaps decades later. Frank cases are most often seen as acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, a disease that resembles acute pneumonia but is usually self-limited.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kauffman2007 /> It is most often seen in children newly exposed to ''H. capsulatum'' or in heavily exposed individuals. Erythematous skin conditions arising from antigen reactions may complicate the disease, as may myalgias, arthralgias, and rarely, arthritic conditions. Emphysema sufferers may contract chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis as a disease complication; eventually the cavity formed may be occupied by an ''[[Aspergillus]]'' fungus ball ([[aspergilloma]]), potentially leading to massive hemoptysis.<ref name=kauffman2007 /> Another uncommon form of histoplasmosis is a slowly progressing condition known as granulomatous mediastinitis, in which the lymph nodes in the mediastinal cavity between the lungs become inflamed and ultimately necrotic; the swollen nodes or draining fluid may ultimately affect the bronchi, the superior vena cava, the esophagus or the pericardium. A particularly dangerous condition is mediastinal fibrosis, in which a subset of individuals with granulomatous mediastinitis develop an uncontrolled fibrotic reaction that may press on the lungs or the bronchi, or may cause right heart failure. There are a number of other rare pulmonary manifestations of histoplasmosis.

Histoplasmosis, like blastomycosis, may disseminate haematogenously to infect internal organs and tissues, but it does so in a very low proportion of cases, and half or more of these dissemination cases involve immunocompromisation. Unlike blastomycosis, histoplasmosis is a recognized [[HIV/AIDS#Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|AIDS]]-defining illness in people with [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] infection; disseminated histoplasmosis affects approximately 5% of AIDS patients with [[CD4]]+ cell counts <150 cells/μL in highly endemic areas.<ref name=hajjeh1995 /> The incidence of this condition dropped significantly after introduction of current anti-HIV therapies.<ref name=kauffman2007 /> Other conditions very uncommonly associated with ''H. capsulatum'' include [[endocarditis]] and [[peritonitis]].<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=rippon1988 />

==Ecology and epidemiology==
''Histoplasma capsulatum'' appears to be strongly associated with the droppings of certain bird species as well as bats.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> A mixture of these droppings and certain soil types is particularly conducive to proliferation. In highly endemic areas there is a strong association with soil under and around chicken houses, and with areas where soil or vegetation has become heavily contaminated with faecal material deposited by flocking birds such as [[starling]]s and [[New World blackbird|blackbird]]s. Bird roosting areas that are ''Histoplasma''-free appear to be lower in nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter and moisture than contaminated roosting areas.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The guano of gulls and other colonially nesting water-associated birds is rarely connected to histoplasmosis.<ref name=waldman1983 /> Bat dwellings, including caves, attics and hollow trees, are classic ''H. capsulatum'' habitats.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=rippon1988 />

Histoplasmosis outbreaks are typically associated with cleaning guano accumulations or clearing guano-covered vegetation, or with exploration of bat caves. In addition, however, outbreaks may be associated with wind-blown dust liberated by construction projects in endemic areas: a classic outbreak is one associated with intense construction activity, including subway construction, in Montreal in 1963.<ref name="leznoff1964" />

As with [[blastomycosis]], a good understanding of the precise ecological affinities of ''H. capsulatum'' is greatly complicated by the difficulty of isolating the fungus directly from nature. Again, the mouse passage procedure originally devised by Emmons<ref name=emmons1961 /> must be used. A direct PCR technique for detection of ''H. capsulatum'' in soil has been published.<ref name=reid1999 /> ''H. capsulatum'' appears particularly likely to cause clinical disease in young children, persons working in sites contaminated by conducive bird or bat droppings, persons exposed to construction dust raised from contaminated sites, immunocompromised patients, and emphysema sufferers. Elimination of the agent from contaminated soils typically involves the use of toxic fumigants with limited success.<ref name=ajello1983 />

==Etymology==
In 1905, [[Samuel Taylor Darling]] serendipitously identified a protozoan-like microorganism in an autopsy specimen while trying to understand [[malaria]], which was prevalent during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. He named this microorganism ''Histoplasma capsulatum'' because it invaded the cytoplasm ('''plasma''') of histiocyte-like cells ('''Histo''') and had a refractive halo mimicking a capsule ('''capsulatum'''), a misnomer. <ref> {{cite journal|last1=Mahajan|first1=Monika|title=Etymologia: Histoplasma capsulatum|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=2021|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969|doi=10.3201/eid2703.et2703|quote=Citing public domain text from the CDC|doi-access=free|pmc=7920646}}</ref>
