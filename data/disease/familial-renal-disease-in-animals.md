'''Familial renal disease''' is an uncommon cause of [[kidney failure]] in [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Most causes are breed-related (familial) and some are inherited.  Some are [[congenital disorder|congenital]] (present at birth).  '''Renal dysplasia''' is a type of familial kidney disease characterized by abnormal [[cellular differentiation]] of [[kidney]] tissue.  Dogs and cats with kidney disease caused by these diseases have the typical symptoms of kidney failure, including weight loss, loss of appetite, depression, and increased water consumption and urination.  A list of familial kidney diseases by dog and cat breeds is found below.

==Familial renal disease in dogs==

===Basenji===
[[Basenji]]s can be affected by a type of kidney tubular dysfunction similar to that of [[Fanconi syndrome]] in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Easley|first1=JR|last2=Breitschwerdt|first2=DB|title=Glucosuria associated with renal tubular dysfunction in three Basenji dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=15 May 1976|volume=168|issue=10|pages=938–43|pmid=1270337}}</ref>

===Beagle===
[[Beagle]]s can be affected by [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerular]] [[amyloidosis]], which is deposition of [[amyloid]] in the kidney. Findings include [[Proteinuria|protein in the urine]]. It does progress.

===Bull Terrier===
[[Bull Terrier]]s can be affected by an inherited type of kidney disease caused by [[basal lamina|basement membrane]] disease. Protein in the urine is a consistent finding. Bull Terriers are affected between the ages of one and eight years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7216-6795-9}}</ref>

===Cairn Terrier===
[[Cairn Terrier]]s can be affected by polycystic kidney disease. Multiple small [[cyst]]s are found in the kidneys. Cysts are present by the age of six weeks.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  It is inherited through an [[recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] mechanism.<ref name=Giger>{{cite web | last = Giger | first = Urs | title = Diseases of the Kidneys | work = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2621 | accessdate = 2007-03-25 }}</ref>

===Chow Chow===
[[Chow Chow]]s can be affected by renal dysplasia that progresses to kidney failure and secondary fibrous [[renal osteodystrophy]], causing fractures and "rubber jaw".

===Cocker Spaniel===
[[Cocker Spaniel]]s can be affected by glomerular disease before the age of four years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  It does progress to kidney failure.  It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lees G, Helman R, Homco L, Millichamp N, Hunter J, Frey M |title=Early diagnosis of familial nephropathy in English cocker spaniels |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=189–95 |year=1998 |pmid=9590445}}</ref>

===Doberman Pinscher===
[[Doberman Pinscher]]s can be affected by basement membrane disease of the kidneys that can progress to kidney failure.

===German Shepherd===
[[German Shepherd dog]]s can be affected by multiple [[cystadenocarcinoma]]s of the kidney. It is inherited and appears between the ages of five and 11 years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Blood in the urine is often seen.  It is sometimes accompanied by nodules in the skin or multiple [[uterus|uterine]] [[leiomyoma]]s.

===Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu===
[[Lhasa Apso]]s and [[Shih Tzu]]s can both be affected by renal dysplasia before the age of five years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  It does progress to kidney failure.  It can be accompanied by fibrous osteodystrophy, caused by [[calcium]] absorption from the bone.  Signs include bone fractures and "rubber jaw".

===Miniature Schnauzer===
[[Miniature Schnauzer]]s can be affected by renal dysplasia before the age of five years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/> It does progress to kidney failure.

===Norwegian Elkhound===
[[Norwegian Elkhound]]s can be affected by kidney tubule disease (Fanconi syndrome) that does not progress to kidney failure. A consistent finding is glucose in the urine.

===Rottweiler===
[[Rottweiler]]s can be affected by glomerular disease before the age of one year that does progress to kidney failure.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Findings include protein in the urine and high [[cholesterol]] levels in the blood.

===Samoyed===
{{main|Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy}}
[[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]]s can be affected by basement membrane disease of the kidneys. It is inherited through the [[X chromosome]] and is therefore more severe in affected male dogs. Findings in male dogs include the presence of protein and glucose in the urine and the inability to concentrate urine, and progression to kidney failure by the age of 9 months and death by 16 months.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Affected female dogs have protein in the urine and a failure to gain a normal amount of weight, but are usually otherwise normal.

===Shar Pei===
[[Shar Pei]]s can be affected by glomerular amyloidosis caused by deposition of amyloid in the kidneys and occurs secondary to [[Shar Pei fever]]. It progresses to kidney failure by the age of six years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

===Shih Tzu===
[[Shih Tzu]]s have a type of renal dysplasia characterized by persistence of the fetal [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]]. The predominating signs are of chronic kidney failure. Severely affected dogs only live for a few months. The mechanism of inheritance appears to be through an [[autosomal dominant]] gene with incomplete [[penetrance]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Bovee | first = Kenneth C. | title = Renal Dysplasia in Shih Tzu Dogs | work = Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2003 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6602&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-03-25 }}</ref>

===Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier===
[[Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier]]s can be affected by renal dysplasia that progresses to kidney failure. It is usually seen by the age of three years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

===Standard Poodle===
[[Standard Poodle]]s can be affected by renal dysplasia by the age of two years that progresses to kidney failure.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Secondary fibrous osteodystrophy can be seen.

===Welsh Corgi===
[[Welsh Corgi]]s can be affected by kidney [[telangiectasia]]s between the ages of five and thirteen years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  It is characterized by red-black nodules in the kidneys.  It can cause [[hydronephrosis]] and abdominal pain.  It usually does not progress to kidney failure.

==Familial renal disease in cats==

===Abyssinian===
[[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian]]s can be affected by glomerular [[amyloid]]osis between the ages of one and five years.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  It progresses to renal failure.  Findings include protein in the urine.  It is inherited.

===Persian===

[[Persian (cat)|Persian]]s can be affected by [[polycystic kidney disease]], characterized by small cysts in the kidneys.  It is inherited through an [[autosomal dominant]] mechanism and can progress to kidney disease later in life.<ref name=Giger/>
