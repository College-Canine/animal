==Causes==
Urinary incontinence can result from both [[Urology|urologic]] and non-urologic causes. Urologic causes can be classified as either [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] dysfunction or [[Urethral sphincters|urethral sphincter]] incompetence and may include [[Overactive bladder|detrusor overactivity]], poor bladder compliance, [[urethral hypermobility]], or [[intrinsic sphincter deficiency]]. Non-urologic causes may include [[infection]], medication or drugs, psychological factors, [[polyuria]], [[hydrocephalus]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards RJ, Dombrowski SM, Luciano MG, Pople IK | title = Chronic hydrocephalus in adults | journal = Brain Pathology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–336 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15446589 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3639.2004.tb00072.x | pmc = 8096062 }}</ref> [[fecal impaction|stool impaction]], and restricted mobility.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Urological Association - Medical Student Curriculum: Urinary Incontinence|url=http://www.auanet.org/education/auauniversity/medical-student-education/medical-student-curriculum/urinary-incontinence|website=www.auanet.org|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> The causes leading to urinary incontinence are usually specific to each sex, however, some causes are common to both men and women.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== Women ===
[[File:1116 Muscle of the Female Perineum.png|alt=Pelvic floor muscles in women|thumb|upright=1.5|Pelvic floor muscles in women]]
The most common types of urinary incontinence in women are [[Stress incontinence|stress urinary incontinence]] and [[Overactive bladder|urge urinary incontinence]]. Women that have symptoms of both types are said to have "mixed" urinary incontinence. After [[menopause]], [[estrogen]] production decreases and, in some women, [[urethra]]l tissue will demonstrate [[atrophy]], becoming weaker and thinner, possibly playing a role in the development of urinary incontinence.<ref name="womengov" />

[[Stress incontinence|Stress urinary incontinence]] in women is most commonly caused by loss of support of the [[urethra]], which is usually a consequence of damage to [[Pelvic floor|pelvic support structures]] as a result of [[pregnancy]], childbirth, [[obesity]], age, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Urinary incontinence - Causes|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-incontinence/causes/|date=2017-10-23|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref> About 33% of all women experience urinary incontinence after giving birth, and women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a [[Caesarean section]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom DH, Rortveit G | title = Prevalence of postpartum urinary incontinence: a systematic review | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 1511–1522 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21050146 | doi = 10.3109/00016349.2010.526188 | s2cid = 18385231 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Stress incontinence is characterized by leaking of small amounts of urine with activities that increase abdominal pressure such as coughing, sneezing, laughing and lifting. This happens when the urethral sphincter cannot close completely due to the damage in the sphincter itself, or the surrounding tissue.  Additionally, frequent exercise in high-impact activities can cause [[athletic incontinence]] to develop. Urge urinary incontinence, is caused by uninhibited contractions of the [[detrusor muscle]], a condition known as [[Overactive bladder|overactive bladder syndrome]]. This type of urinary incontinence is more commonly seen in women of older age.<ref name="auto">{{Cite report |url=https://www.pcori.org/sites/default/files/PCORI-AHRQ-Nonsurgical-Treatments-Urinary-Incontinence-Women-Systematic-Review-Update-Report-August-2018.pdf |title=Nonsurgical Treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Women: A Systematic Review Update |last1=Balk |first1=Ethan |last2=Adam |first2=Gaelen P. |date=2018-08-08 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) |issue=Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 212 |doi=10.23970/ahrqepccer212 |location=Rockville, MD |last3=Kimmel |first3=Hannah |last4=Rofeberg |first4=Valerie |last5=Saeed |first5=Iman |last6=Jeppson |first6=Peter |last7=Trikalinos |first7=Thomas}}

=== Men ===
[[File:Prostatic urethra.svg|alt=prostatic urethra|thumb|upright=1.5|The prostate with the urethra passing through it ([[prostatic urethra]])]]
[[Overactive bladder|Urge incontinence]] is the most common type of incontinence in men.<ref name="Clemens_2022">{{Cite web | vauthors = Clemens JQ | date = 3 January 2022 | veditors = O'Leary MP, Law K |title=Urinary Incontinence in Men|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men|work = UptoDate|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref> Similar to women, urine leakage happens following a very intense feeling of urination, not allowing enough time to reach the bathroom, a condition called [[Overactive bladder|overactive bladder syndrome]].

[[Stress incontinence|Stress urinary incontinence]] is the other common type of incontinence in men, and it most commonly happens after prostate surgery.<ref name="Wang">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang W, Huang QM, Liu FP, Mao QQ | title = Effectiveness of preoperative pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis | journal = BMC Urology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 99 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25515968 | pmc = 4274700 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2490-14-99 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Prostatectomy]], [[transurethral resection of the prostate]], [[prostate brachytherapy]], and [[Radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] can all damage the [[Urethral sphincters|urethral sphincter]] and surrounding tissue, causing it to be incompetent.

Continence usually improves within 6 to 12 months after prostate surgery without any specific interventions, and only 5 to 10% of people report persistent symptoms.<ref name="Clemens_2022" />

=== Both ===
* Age is a risk factor that increases both the severity and prevalence of UI
* [[Polyuria]] (excessive urine production) of which, in turn, the most frequent causes are: uncontrolled [[diabetes mellitus]], [[primary polydipsia]] (excessive fluid [[drinking]]), [[central diabetes insipidus]] and [[nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]].<ref name="merck">{{cite web | vauthors = Maddukuri G | date = December 2022 | title = Pathophysiology of Polyuria | url = http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch226/ch226i.html | work = [[Merck Manual]] }}</ref> Polyuria generally causes [[urinary urgency]] and [[urinary frequency|frequency]], but does not necessarily lead to incontinence.

* [[Overactive bladder|Overactive bladder syndrome]]. However, the etiology behind this is usually different between men and women, as mentioned above.
* Other suggested risk factors include [[smoking]], caffeine intake and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]

==Mechanism==
=== Adults ===
The body stores urine — water and wastes removed by the kidneys — in the [[urinary bladder]], a balloon-like organ. The bladder connects to the [[urethra]], the tube through which urine leaves the body.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersson KE, Arner A | title = Urinary bladder contraction and relaxation: physiology and pathophysiology | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 935–986 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15269341 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00038.2003 }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Continence and [[micturition]] involve a balance between [[urethral]] closure and [[detrusor]] muscle activity (the muscle of the bladder). During [[urination]], [[detrusor muscle]]s in the wall of the bladder contract, forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, [[sphincter]] muscles surrounding the urethra relax, letting urine pass out of the body.  The [[Urethral sphincters|urethral sphincter]] is the muscular ring that closes the outlet of the urinary bladder preventing urine to pass outside the body. Urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder pressure, resulting in urine remaining in the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and maintaining continence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeLancey JO | title = Anatomy and physiology of urinary continence | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 298–307 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2190733 | doi = 10.1097/00003081-199006000-00014 | s2cid = 43806356 }}</ref> The urethra is supported by [[Pelvic floor|pelvic floor muscles]] and tissue, allowing it to close firmly. Any damage to this balance between the [[detrusor muscle]], [[Urethral sphincters|urethral sphincter]], supportive tissue and nerves can lead to some type of incontinence .{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

For example, [[Stress incontinence|stress urinary incontinence]] is usually a result of the incompetent closure of the urethral sphincter. This can be caused by damage to the sphincter itself, the muscles that support it, or nerves that supply it. In men, the damage usually happens after prostate surgery or radiation,<ref name="Clemens_2022" /> and in women, it's usually caused by childbirth and pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeLancey JO | title = The pathophysiology of stress urinary incontinence in women and its implications for surgical treatment | journal = World Journal of Urology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 268–274 | date = 1997-10-01 | pmid = 9372577 | doi = 10.1007/BF02202011 | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 12952663 | hdl = 2027.42/47055 }}</ref> The pressure inside the abdomen (from coughing and sneezing) is normally transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally, leaving the pressure difference unchanged, resulting in continence. When the sphincter is incompetent, this increase in pressure will push the urine against it, leading to incontinence.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Another example is urge incontinence. This incontinence is associated with sudden forceful contractions of the [[detrusor muscle]] (bladder muscle), leading to an intense feeling of urination, and incontinence if the person does not reach the bathroom on time. The syndrome is known as [[Overactive bladder|overactive bladder syndrome]], and it's related to dysfunction of the detrusor muscle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Overactive Bladder (OAB): Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment | work = Urology Care Foundation |url= https://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/overactive-bladder-(oab) |access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref>

===Children===
[[File:Voiding dysfunction.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Voiding dysfunction]]
{{main|Enuresis}}
Urination, or voiding, is a complex activity. The bladder is a balloon-like muscle that lies in the lowest part of the abdomen. The bladder stores urine and then releases it through the urethra, which is the canal that carries urine to the outside of the body. Controlling this activity involves nerves, muscles, the spinal cord and the brain.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The bladder is made of two types of muscles: the detrusor and the sphincter. The detrusor is a muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to empty. Connected to the bottom or next of the bladder, the sphincter is a circular group of muscles that automatically stays contracted to hold the urine in. It will automatically relax when the detrusor contracts to let the urine into the urethra. A third group of muscles below the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) can contract to keep urine back.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

A baby's bladder fills to a set point, then automatically contracts and empties. As the child gets older, the nervous system develops. The child's brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and place to void.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

Failures in this control mechanism result in incontinence. Reasons for this failure range from the simple to the complex.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Ultrasound of trabeculated urinary bladder.jpg|alt=Ultrasound of the urinary bladder|thumb|upright=1.4|Ultrasound of the urinary bladder of an 85-year-old man. It shows a trabeculated wall, which is a sign of [[urinary retention]].]]
The pattern of voiding and urine leakage is important as it suggests the type of incontinence. Other points include straining and discomfort, use of drugs, recent surgery, and illness.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

The [[physical examination]] looks for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, such as tumors that block the urinary tract, stool impaction, and poor reflexes or sensations, which may be evidence of a nerve-related cause.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

Other tests include:<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Lukacz ES | date = 2 August 2023 | veditors = Schmader KE, Law K | title=Evaluation of Females with Urinary Incontinence|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-females-with-urinary-incontinence|website=UptoDate}}</ref>
* [[Stress testing|Stress test]]&nbsp;– the patient relaxes, then coughs vigorously as the doctor watches for loss of urine.
* [[Urinalysis]]&nbsp;– urine is tested for evidence of infection, urinary stones, or other contributing causes.
* [[Blood test]]s&nbsp;– blood is taken, sent to a laboratory, and examined for substances related to causes of incontinence.
* [[Ultrasound]]&nbsp;– sound waves are used to visualize the kidneys and urinary bladder, assess the capacity of the bladder before voiding, and the remaining amount of urine after voiding. This helps know if there's a problem in emptying.
* [[Cystoscopy]]&nbsp;– a thin tube with a tiny camera is inserted in the urethra and used to see the inside of the urethra and bladder.
* [[Urodynamics]]&nbsp;– various techniques measure pressure in the bladder and the flow of urine.

People are often asked to keep a diary for a day or more, up to a week, to record the pattern of voiding, noting times and the amounts of urine produced.

Research projects that assess the [[efficacy]] of anti-incontinence therapies often quantify the extent of urinary incontinence. The methods include the 1-h pad test, measuring leakage volume; using a voiding diary, counting the number of incontinence episodes (leakage episodes) per day; and assessing of the strength of pelvic floor muscles, measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure.

=== Main types ===
There are 4 main types of urinary incontinence:
# [[Stress incontinence]], also known as effort incontinence, is essentially due to incomplete closure of the urinary sphincter, due to problems in the sphincter itself or insufficient strength of the pelvic floor muscles supporting it. This type of incontinence is when urine leaks during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing or bearing down.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Urinary incontinence: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003142.htm|access-date=2021-03-31| work = MedlinePlus | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine |language=en}}</ref>
# [[Urge incontinence]] is an involuntary loss of urine occurring while suddenly feeling the need or urge to urinate, usually secondary to [[Overactive bladder|overactive bladder syndrome]].
# [[Overflow incontinence]] is the incontinence that happens suddenly without feeling the urge to urinate and without necessarily doing any physical activities. It is also known as under-active bladder syndrome. This usually happens with chronic obstruction of the bladder outlet or with diseases damaging the nerves supplying the urinary bladder. The urine stretches the bladder without the person feeling the pressure, and eventually, it overwhelms the ability of the urethral sphincter to hold it back.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Overflow Incontinence | work = Michigan Medicine|url=https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/uh1227 |access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref>
# [[Mixed incontinence]] contains symptoms of multiple other types of incontinence. It is not uncommon in the elderly female population and can sometimes be complicated by [[urinary retention]].

=== Other types ===
* [[Functional incontinence]] occurs when a person recognizes the need to urinate but cannot make it to the bathroom. The loss of urine may be large. There are several causes of functional incontinence including confusion, dementia, poor eyesight, mobility or dexterity, unwillingness to use the toilet because of depression or anxiety or inebriation due to alcohol.<ref name="au">{{cite web|title=Functional incontinence|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/continence-what-functional.htm|year=2008|publisher=Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723150611/http://health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/continence-what-functional.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=2008-07-23|access-date=2008-08-29}}</ref>  Functional incontinence can also occur in certain circumstances where no biological or medical problem is present. For example, a person may recognize the need to urinate but may be in a situation where there is no toilet nearby or access to a toilet is restricted.
* Structural incontinence: Rarely, structural problems can cause incontinence, usually diagnosed in childhood (for example, an [[ectopic ureter]]). [[Fistula]]s caused by obstetric and gynecologic trauma or injury are commonly known as [[obstetric fistula]]s and can lead to incontinence. These types of vaginal fistulas include, most commonly, vesicovaginal fistula and, more rarely, ureterovaginal fistula. These may be difficult to diagnose. The use of standard techniques along with a [[vaginogram]] or radiologically viewing the [[vaginal vault]] with instillation of contrast media.<ref name="pmid7265431">{{cite journal | vauthors = Macaluso JN, Appell RA, Sullivan JW | title = Ureterovaginal fistula detected by vaginogram | journal = JAMA | volume = 246 | issue = 12 | pages = 1339–1340 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 7265431 | doi = 10.1001/jama.246.12.1339 }}</ref>
* [[Nocturnal enuresis]] is episodic UI while asleep. It is normal in young children.
* Transient incontinence is temporary incontinence most often seen in pregnant women when it subsequently resolves after the birth of the child.<ref name="SangsawangSangsawang2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sangsawang B, Sangsawang N | title = Stress urinary incontinence in pregnant women: a review of prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment | journal = International Urogynecology Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 901–912 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23436035 | pmc = 3671107 | doi = 10.1007/s00192-013-2061-7 }}</ref>
* [[Giggle incontinence]] is an involuntary response to laughter. It usually affects children.
* Double incontinence. There is also a related condition for [[defecation]] known as [[fecal incontinence]]. Due to involvement of the same muscle group ([[levator ani]]) in bladder and bowel continence, patients with urinary incontinence are more likely to have fecal incontinence in addition.<ref name="Shamliyan 2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shamliyan T, Wyman J, Bliss DZ, Kane RL, Wilt TJ | title = Prevention of urinary and fecal incontinence in adults | journal = Evidence Report/Technology Assessment | issue = 161 | pages = 1–379 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18457475 | pmc = 4781595 }}</ref>  This is sometimes termed "double incontinence".
* [[Post-void dribbling]] is the phenomenon where urine remaining in the urethra after voiding the bladder slowly leaks out after urination.
* [[Coital incontinence]] (CI) is urinary leakage that occurs during either [[coitus|penetration]] or [[orgasm]] and can occur with a sexual partner or with [[masturbation]]. It has been reported to occur in 10% to 24% of sexually active women with pelvic floor disorders.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Karlovsky ME | url = http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sig/uroG/articles/034_08_032.asp | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101122151307/http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sig/uroG/articles/034_08_032.asp | archive-date = 22 November 2010 | title = Female Urinary Incontinence During Sexual Intercourse (Coital Incontinence): A Review | work = The Female Patient }}</ref>
* [[Climacturia]] is urinary incontinence at the moment of orgasm. It can be a result of radical [[prostatectomy]].

=== Behavioral therapy, physical therapy and exercise ===
Behavioral therapy involves the use of both suppressive techniques (distraction, relaxation) and learning to avoid foods that may worsen urinary incontinence. This may involve avoiding or limiting consumption of caffeine and alcohol. Behavioral therapies, including bladder training, biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle training, are most effective for improving urinary incontinence in women, with a low risk of adverse events.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Balk EM, Adam GP, Corsi K, Mogul A, Trikalinos TA, Jeppson PC | title = Adverse Events Associated with Nonsurgical Treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Women: a Systematic Review | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1615–1625 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31062225 | pmc = 6667523 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-019-05028-0 }}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Todhunter-Brown A, Hazelton C, Campbell P, Elders A, Hagen S, McClurg D | title = Conservative interventions for treating urinary incontinence in women: an Overview of Cochrane systematic reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2022 | issue = 9 | pages = CD012337 | date = September 2022 | pmid = 36053030 | pmc = 9437962 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012337.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Incontinence Group }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Imamura M, Williams K, Wells M, McGrother C | title = Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2015 | issue = 12 | pages = CD003505 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26630349 | pmc = 8612696 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003505.pub5 | collaboration = Cochrane Incontinence Group }}</ref><ref name="auto" /> Behavioral therapy is not curative for urinary incontinence, but it can improve a person's quality of life.

[[Biofeedback]] uses measuring devices to help the patient become aware of his or her body's functioning. By using electronic devices or diaries to track when the bladder and urethral muscles contract, the patient can gain control over these muscles.

===Devices===
[[File:Foley Catheter Drainage.png|alt=foley catheter|thumb|279x279px|Example of a [[foley catheter]]]]
Individuals who continue to experience urinary incontinence need to find a management solution that matches their individual situation. The use of mechanical devices has not been well studied in women, as of 2014.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipp A, Shaw C, Glavind K | title = Mechanical devices for urinary incontinence in women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2014 | issue = 12 | pages = CD001756 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25517397 | pmc = 7061494 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001756.pub6 }}</ref>

Solutions exist for all levels of incontinence. Advantages with collecting systems are that they are discreet, the skin stays dry all the time, and they are convenient to use both day and night.  Disadvantages are that it is necessary to get measured to ensure proper fit, and in some countries, a prescription is needed.
* Absorbent products (include [[Incontinence pad|shields]], [[incontinence pad]]s, undergarments, protective underwear, briefs, diapers, [[adult diapers]] and underpants) are the best-known product types to manage incontinence. They are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets. The advantages of using these are that they barely need any fitting or introduction by a healthcare specialist. The disadvantages with absorbent products are that they can be bulky, leak, have odors and can cause skin breakdown due to the constant dampness.
* [[Intermittent catheterisation|Intermittent catheters]] are single-use catheters that are inserted into the bladder to empty it, and once the bladder is empty they are removed and discarded. Intermittent catheters are primarily used for urinary retention (inability to empty the bladder), but for some people they can be used to reduce or avoid incontinence.  These are prescription-only medical devices.
* [[File:Pessaries.JPG|alt=Vaginal pessaries|thumb|321x321px|Different types of pessaries.

These are also prescription-only medical devices. The indwelling catheter is typically connected to a urine bag that can be worn on the leg or hung on the side of the bed. Indwelling catheters need to be monitored and changed on a regular basis by a healthcare professional. The advantage of indwelling catheters is that because the urine is funneled away from the body, the skin remains dry. However, the disadvantage is that it is very common to incur urinary tract infections when using indwelling catheters.  Bladder spasms and other problems can also occur with long-term use of indwelling catheters.<ref name="pmid10670503">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cravens DD, Zweig S | title = Urinary catheter management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–376 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10670503 }}</ref>

The [[artificial urinary sphincter]] is an implantable device used to treat stress incontinence, mostly in men. The device is made of 2 or 3 parts: The pump, cuff, and balloon reservoir connected to each other by specialized tubes.  The cuff wraps around the urethra and closes it. When the person wants to urinate, he presses the pump (implanted in the scrotum), to deflate the cuff, and allow the urine to pass.

Incontinence is expensive both to individuals in the form of bladder control products and to the health care system and nursing home industry. Injury-related to incontinence is a leading cause of admission to assisted living and nursing care facilities. In 1997 more than 50% of nursing facility admissions were related to incontinence.<ref name="pmid9351481">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thom DH, Haan MN, Van Den Eeden SK | title = Medically recognized urinary incontinence and risks of hospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–374 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9351481 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/26.5.367 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Women ===
Approximately 17% of non-pregnant women have urinary incontinence, with the most common types being stress, urgency, and mixed. <ref>{{Cite report |url=https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/topics/urinary-incontinence-update/final-report-2018 |title=Nonsurgical Treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Women: A Systematic Review Update |last=Balk |first=Ethan |last2=Adam |first2=Gaelen P. |date=2018-08-08 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) |doi=10.23970/ahrqepccer212 |last3=Kimmel |first3=Hannah |last4=Rofeberg |first4=Valerie |last5=Saeed |first5=Iman |last6=Jeppson |first6=Peter |last7=Trikalinos |first7=Thomas}}</ref> Bladder symptoms affect women of all ages.

=== Men ===
Men tend to experience incontinence less often than women, and the structure of the male [[urinary tract]] accounts for this difference. Stress incontinence is common after [[prostate cancer]] treatments.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

While urinary incontinence affects older men more often than younger men, the onset of incontinence can happen at any age. Estimates around 2007 suggested that 17 percent of men over age 60, an estimated 600,000 men in the [[US]], experienced urinary incontinence, with this percentage increasing with age.<ref>{{cite book|title=Urologic Diseases in America Report|vauthors=Stothers L, Thom D, Calhoun E|date=2007|publisher= ([[US]]) [[National Institutes of Health]]|chapter=Chapter 6: Urinary Incontinence in Men}}</ref>

=== Children ===
Incontinence happens less often after age 5: About 10 percent of 5-year-olds, 5 percent of 10-year-olds, and 1 percent of 18-year-olds experience episodes of incontinence. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pediatric incontinence - Franco - 2015 - Wiley Online Books - Wiley Online Library|year=2015|isbn=9781118814789| veditors = Franco I, Austin PF, Bauer SB, von Gontard A, Homsy Y |doi=10.1002/9781118814789}}</ref>

== History ==
The management of urinary incontinence with pads is mentioned in the earliest medical book known, the [[Ebers Papyrus]] (1500 BC).<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Becker HD, Stenzl A, Wallwiener D, Zittel TT |title=Urinary and fecal incontinence : an interdisciplinary approach; with 89 tables|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=978-3540222255|location=Berlin [u.a.]|page=232|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

Incontinence has historically been a taboo subject in Western culture. However, this situation changed some when [[Kimberly-Clark]] aggressively marketed [[adult diaper]]s in the 1980s with actor [[June Allyson]] as spokeswoman. Allyson was initially reticent to participate, but her mother, who had incontinence, convinced her that it was her duty in light of her successful career. The product proved a success.<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = O'Reilly T |date=8 June 2017|title=Now Splinter Free: How Marketing Broke Taboos|publisher=CBC Radio One|agency=Pirate Radio|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/now-splinter-free-how-marketing-broke-taboos-1.4149558|access-date=10 June 2017|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

== Law ==
The case ''Hiltibran et al v. Levy et al'' in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]] resulted in that court issuing an order in 2011. That order requires [[adult diaper|incontinence briefs]] funded by [[Medicaid]] to be given by Missouri to adults who would be institutionalized without them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.olmsteadrights.org/advocacytools/recent-cases/|title=Recent Cases - Olmstead Rights|website=www.olmsteadrights.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite court |litigants= Hiltibran et al v.

== Research ==
The effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches to treating urinary incontinence is not well studied for some medical conditions. For example, for people who experience urinary incontinence due to stroke, treatment approaches such as physical therapy, cognitive therapy, complementary medicine, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals are sometimes suggested, however it is not clear how effective these are at improving incontinence and there is no strong medical evidence to guide clinical practice.<ref name="Thomas_2019" />
