The '''Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever''' is a medium-sized [[gundog]] bred primarily for hunting. It is often referred to as a "toller". It is the smallest of the retrievers, and is often mistaken for a small [[Golden Retriever]]. Tollers are intelligent, eager to please, alert, and energetic.<ref name="akc-toller">{{Cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever/|title=American Kennel Club|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> The name "toller" is derived from their ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot range. The breed originated in [[Yarmouth County]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada.<ref name="ckc-choosing">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ckc.ca/en/Choosing-a-Dog/Choosing-a-Breed/Sporting-Dogs/Retriever-Nova-Scotia-Duck-Tolling|title=Canadian Kennel Club|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> The [[American Kennel Club]] ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.<ref name="akc-toller"/>

== History ==
The breed was developed in the [[Acadian]] community of [[Little River Harbour, Nova Scotia|Little River Harbour]] in [[Yarmouth County]], [[Nova Scotia]], around the beginning of the 19th century. The toller was originally referred to as the Little River Duck Dog before being officially recognized by the [[Canadian Kennel Club]] in 1945 as a purebred dog. The toller is a mixture of [[retriever]]s, [[spaniel]]s, [[setter]]s, and possibly a farm [[collie]] [[mongrel]], although this has yet to be confirmed. The breed was perfected in the second half of the 19th century.<ref name="ckc-choosing"/>

The breed gained national recognition in 1980, and was declared the provincial dog of Nova Scotia in 1995, when two Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were awarded Best in Show at championship events that included many breeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nslegislature.ca/index.php/about/symbols/nova_scotia_duck_tolling_retriever |title=Nova Scotia Legislature: Duck Toller |publisher=Nslegislature.ca |date=March 29, 2012 |access-date=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

== Use in hunting ==
Tollers are named for their ability to entice or lure [[waterfowl]] within gunshot range, called "tolling".<ref name="CKC_Profile" /> The hunter stays hidden in a [[hunting blind|blind]] and sends the dog out to romp and play near the water, usually by tossing a ball or stick to be retrieved. The dog's appearance is similar to that of a fox. Its unusual activity and white markings pique the curiosity of ducks and geese, which swim over to investigate.<ref name="AKC_Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/nova_scotia_duck_tolling_retriever/index.cfm|title=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever|author=American Kennel Club|access-date=September 7, 2010|archive-date=February 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209121421/http://www.akc.org/breeds/nova_scotia_duck_tolling_retriever/index.cfm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When the birds are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, then rises, putting the birds to flight and allowing themselves a shot. The Toller then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving in cold water climates because of their water-repellent double coat.<ref name="AKC_Profile" />

Tollers are often mistaken for small [[Golden Retriever]]s, but the Toller is more active, both physically and mentally.<ref name=howell /> According to the [[breed standard]]s, the Toller is athletic, muscular, compact, medium to heavy boned, balanced and powerful.<ref name="ckc-choosing"/> The chest is deep. Conformation judges require Tollers to be capable of tolling and physical faults that inhibit working ability are heavily penalized. They should be of moderate build — a lack of substance or a heavy build are penalized by judges because both detract from the breed standard and athleticism. The legs are sturdy and solid and they have webbed feet.<ref name="CKC_Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.ckc.ca/en/Default.aspx?tabid=99&BreedCode=RNS|title=CKC Breeding Standards: Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever|author=Canadian Kennel Club|access-date=September 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="AKC_Profile" />

Tollers can be any shade of red ranging from a golden red through dark coppery red with lighter featherings on the underside of the tail, pantaloons, and body. The lighter shades of golden red are deeply pigmented and rich in colour. The Toller should not be buff, brown, or beige, though some buff and sable Tollers do appear in breeding lines.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" />

It is common for a Toller to have at least one of the following white markings: tip of tail, feet (not extending above the [[pastern]]s) and chest. Lack of white is not a fault; Tollers can be born without white markings. Dogs with white on the shoulders, around ears, back of neck, across back or flanks, or with silvery, grey or black areas in coat are disqualified from conformation shows.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" />

The Toller was bred to retrieve from icy waters and must have a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness and a soft dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length, the tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" /> The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" />

Those who breed Tollers for [[conformation show]]s consider the head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) to be an important feature and believe it should resemble that of a [[Red Fox|fox]] and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" /> The pigment on a toller's nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but Tollers must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and medium-sized and amber to dark brown in colour. Expression is friendly, alert, and intelligent.

=== Size and proportions ===
Tollers are the smallest of all the retriever breeds.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" /><ref name="GNS_Symbols">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/HOUSE_OF_ASSEMBLY/Symbols/dog.htm|title=Symbols: Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever|author=Government of Nova Scotia|access-date=September 7, 2010|archive-date=August 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817022648/http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/house_of_assembly/symbols/dog.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> They range in height from {{convert|17|-|21|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]], and weigh {{convert|30|-|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with females being slightly shorter and lighter.<ref name="howell">{{cite book|last=Palika|first=Liz|title=The Howell Book of Dogs|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-00921-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9z_n9mDY2tcC&pg=PA307|page=307}}</ref> Tollers are a medium-sized breed.<ref name="CKC_Profile" /><ref name="AKC_Profile" />

Tollers do not have an aggressive bark. Some have a unique sounding bark known as the "Toller scream", a high-pitched [[Howl (sound)|howl]]-like sound which is often referred to as their "singing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsdtrc-usa.org/breed/temperament |title=Temperament &#124; NSDTRC (USA) |publisher=Nsdtrc-usa.org |date=January 24, 2013 |access-date=February 12, 2014}}</ref> They do not use this in violent situations, rather; the "toller scream" is expressed when they are excited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsdtrc-usa.org/breed/top10/ |title=Top 10 &#124; NSDTRC (USA) |publisher=Nsdtrc-usa.org |date=January 24, 2013 |access-date=February 12, 2014}}</ref>

=== Socialization ===
[[File:Viljo koirarannalla 18-edit2.jpg|thumb]]
Tollers have the capacity to be very social dogs as long as they are sufficiently socialized early on in life. While Tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, smells, and sights are crucial to the healthy development of the Toller breed. They tend to get along well with other dogs, however, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a Toller's life. Failure to properly socialize Tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Facts - Wisdom Panel™ Dog Breeds |url=https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/dog-breeds/nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Wisdom Panel™ |language=en-us}}</ref>

== Health ==
Tollers are generally hardy.<ref name="Burkes factsheet">{{cite book |title=The Complete Burke's Backyard: The Ultimate Book of Fact Sheets |last=Burke |first=Don |year=2005 |publisher=Murdoch Books |isbn=1740457390 |page=842 }}</ref> However, like almost all dog breeds, certain genetic disorders are known to occur in the breed. This is sometimes blamed on a relatively small gene pool. The Finnish breed club states the largest health problems in the breed tend to be immunity related.<ref name="Maki (2010)"/> They can be affected by eye problems and [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] and are predisposed to immune-mediated rheumatic disease and steroid-responsive meningitis–arthritis.<ref name="Maki (2010)"/><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilbe | first1 = M. | last2 = Jokinen | first2 = P.

[[Progressive retinal atrophy]] (PRA) affects about 7% of Tollers with an estimated 40% being carriers.<ref>{{cite web|title=prcd-PRA Test For: Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers|url=http://www.optigen.com/opt9_test_pra_toller.html|publisher=OptiGen|access-date=August 27, 2012}}</ref> The type of PRA associated with the breed is known as progressive rod-cone degeneration. The disease causes cells in the retina to degenerate and die. This causes night blindness at first and eventually complete blindness.<ref>{{cite web|title=The OptiGen prcd-PRA Test|url=http://www.optigen.com/opt9_test_prcd_pra.html|publisher=OptiGen|access-date=August 27, 2012}}</ref> [[Collie eye anomaly]] is estimated to have a carrier rate of 5% and an affected rate of 0.5%. It generally only causes mildly impaired vision, although in more severe cases it can lead to retinal hemorrhaging and detachments resulting in blindness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Collie Eye Anomaly in the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever|url=http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/programs/health_program/cea_info.html|publisher=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club (U.S.)|access-date=August 27, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914020150/http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/programs/health_program/cea_info.html|archive-date=September 14, 2012}}</ref>

Thyroid problems have been identified by American breeders as a priority issue, together with epilepsy and hip dysplasia. As many as 1 in 6 Tollers may have [[autoimmune thyroiditis]]. Symptoms of thyroid problems includes weight gain, skin and hair problems including hair loss, weakness, cold intolerance or infertility.<ref>{{cite web|last=Folkman|first=Jane|title=Thyroid/Addison's Study in Tollers – Michigan State University|url=http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/PDF_forms/ThyroidAddisonsStudyinToller.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club (U.S.)|access-date=August 27, 2012}}</ref>

[[Addison's disease]] affected 1% of Tollers in a health survey, an incidence rate 10 times more than the general dog population. Carrier rate is estimated at 18%. This disease is also considered an important issue in the breed. Signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, increased drinking and urination, and shivering.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update – UC Davis Addison's Study in Tollers|url=http://www.nsdtrc-usa.org/PDF_forms/HGC/UCDavisUpdateAMH-0806.pdf|publisher=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club (U.S.)|access-date=August 27, 2012}}</ref>

[[Aseptic meningitis]] (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) has been diagnosed in increasing numbers in the Norwegian Toller population in recent years. Symptoms include intensive neck pain, fever, and lethargy. Prevalence is estimated at 2.5% in the Norwegian population.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A retrospective epidemiological study of clinical signs and familial predisposition associated with aseptic meningitis in the Norwegian population of Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers born 1994–2003|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|date=July 2008|pmc=2442678|pmid=18783024|volume=72|issue=4|pages=350–5|last1=Anfinsen|first1=K.

Health tests are available for both eye diseases and autoimmune thyroiditis. A test for Addison's disease is available but it is only for one form of the disease and there are other forms which also affect the breed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Explanation of JADD Testing Results|url=https://secure.offa.org/dnatesting/jaddexplanation.html|publisher=Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|access-date=August 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730123642/https://secure.offa.org/dnatesting/jaddexplanation.html|archive-date=July 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> A test is also available for one form of [[cleft palate]] that is exclusive to Tollers.

A survey conducted in 2002 by the Canadian Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed club to discover which diseases and conditions occur in the Toller population, involving owners of 1180 dogs worldwide, showed 73% reported in excellent health and a total of 7.5% reporting poor or bad health. 141 dogs (12%) were reported as deceased with the average age at death being 6.4 years. The most common cause of death was cancer, reported in 25% of deaths, with old age being the next most common at 9%.<ref>{{cite web|title=2002 Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Health Survey|url=http://www.toller.ca/tollerhealth/SurveySummary.html|publisher=Toller Health Coalition/NSDTR Club of Canada|access-date=June 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709021639/http://www.toller.ca/tollerhealth/SurveySummary.html|archive-date=July 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012|reason=This is a self-reported primary source that specializes in unusual early mortality.}}

A worldwide study of the Tollers' registration history in 17 countries shows that about 90% of the genetic diversity present in the founding population has been lost. Tollers born between 1999 and 2008 have an effective founder size of 9.8, realized effective [[Small population size|population size]] of 18 and an average [[Coefficient of relationship|inbreeding coefficient]] of 0.26. Breeders are working to prevent [[loss of heterozygosity|losing heterozygosity]] and to maintain sufficient genetic variations. High [[Consanguinity|kinship value]] means the breed is not able to maintain a steady level of inbreeding in the long term.<ref name="Maki (2010)">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mäki | first1 = K. | title = Population structure and genetic diversity of worldwide Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Lancashire Heeler dog populations | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0388.2010.00851.x | journal = Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics | volume = 127 | issue = 4 | pages = 318–326 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20646119}}</ref>

== Activities ==
[[File:Agility - Slalom 8.jpg|thumb|A Toller participating in an agility event]]
The Toller is known to excel in various sporting and obedience activities, and health and safety related jobs. The breeds' high energy and intelligence makes them perfect candidates for difficult jobs that require tremendous dedication and skill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nsdtrc-usa.org/breed/temperament/|title=Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club USA|access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> Tollers enjoy working and being outside, therefore, it is no surprise that they excel at various sport and job related activities.<ref name="ckc-choosing" />
