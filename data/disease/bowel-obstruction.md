'''Bowel obstruction''', also known as '''intestinal obstruction''', is a mechanical or [[Ileus|functional obstruction]] of the [[Gastrointestinal tract#Lower gastrointestinal tract|intestine]]s which prevents the normal movement of the products of [[digestion]].<ref name=SBO2010>{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=J.

<!-- Prevention and treatment -->
The condition may be treated conservatively or with [[surgery]].<ref name=SBO2010/> Typically [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] are given, a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric (NG) tube is placed through the nose into the stomach]] to decompress the intestines, and [[analgesics|pain medications]] are given.<ref name=SBO2010/> [[Antibiotic]]s are often given.<ref name=SBO2010/> In small bowel obstruction about 25% require surgery.<ref name=Fer2014/> Complications may include [[sepsis]], bowel [[ischemia]] and [[bowel perforation]].<ref name=Gor2015/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Depending on the level of obstruction, bowel obstruction can present with [[abdominal pain]], [[abdominal distension]], and [[constipation]]. Bowel obstruction may be complicated by [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte abnormalities]] due to vomiting; respiratory compromise from pressure on the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] by a distended abdomen, or [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of vomitus; bowel [[ischemia]] or [[Gastrointestinal perforation|perforation]] from prolonged distension or pressure from a foreign body and subsequently [[sepsis]] due to [[Gut microbiota|bowel flora]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/large-bowel-obstruction/| title=Large Bowel Obstruction

In small bowel obstruction, the [[pain]] tends to be colicky (cramping and intermittent) in nature, with spasms lasting a few minutes. The pain tends to be central and mid-abdominal. Vomiting may occur before constipation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/large-bowel-obstruction/| title=Large Bowel Obstruction

In large bowel obstruction, the pain is felt lower in the abdomen and the spasms last longer. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, distension, and severe constipation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ferri |first=Fred |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2024 |date=July 12, 2023 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-75576-4 |edition=1st |pages=829.e4–829.e6}}</ref> Constipation occurs earlier and vomiting may be less prominent.

Common physical exam findings may include a palpable [[hernia]], abdominal distension with tympany, nonspecific lower abdominal tenderness, and a rectal mass.<ref name="Fer2014" />

====Outlet obstruction====
Outlet obstruction is a sub-type of large bowel obstruction and refers to conditions affecting the anorectal region that obstruct [[defecation]], specifically conditions of the pelvic floor and anal sphincters. Outlet obstruction can be classified into four groups.<ref name="The Surgical Management of Evacutory Dysfunction">{{cite book| first1 = Andrew P | last1 = Zbar | first2 = Steven D | last2 = Wexner |title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4|page=140}}</ref>
* Functional outlet obstruction
** Inefficient inhibition of the internal anal sphincter
*** Short-segment [[Hirschsprung's disease]]
*** [[Chagas disease]]
*** Hereditary internal sphincter myopathy
** Inefficient relaxation of the striated pelvic floor muscles
*** [[Anismus]] (pelvic floor dyssynergia)
*** [[Multiple sclerosis]]
*** [[Spinal cord]] lesions
* Mechanical outlet obstruction
** [[Internal intussusception]]
** [[Enterocele]]
* Dissipation of force vector
** [[rectocele]]
** [[Descending perineum]]
** [[Rectal prolapse]]
* Impaired rectal sensitivity
** [[Megarectum]]
** Rectal hyposensitivity

==Treatment==
Treatment of small and large bowel obstructions are initially similar and non-operative management is usually the initial management strategy as the majority of small bowel obstruction resolve spontaneously with non-operative management.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last1=Vercruysse |first1=Gary |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572336/ |title=Evaluation and Management of Mechanical Small Bowel Obstruction in Adults |last2=Busch |first2=Rebecca |last3=Dimcheff |first3=Derek |last4=Al-Hawary |first4=Mahmoud |last5=Saad |first5=Richard |last6=Seagull |first6=F.

===Small bowel obstruction===

A small flexible tube ([[nasogastric tube]]) may be inserted through the nose into the stomach to help decompress the dilated bowel. This tube is uncomfortable but relieves the abdominal cramps, distention, and vomiting. [[Intravenous therapy]] is utilized and the urine output may be monitored with a [[catheter]] in the [[urinary bladder|bladder]].<ref>[http://www.smallbowelobstruction.net/ Small Bowel Obstruction overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212215648/http://smallbowelobstruction.net/ |date=February 12, 2010 }}.

Most people with SBO are initially managed conservatively because in many cases, the bowel will open up. Some adhesions loosen up and the obstruction resolves. The patient is examined several times a day, and [[X-ray imaging|X-ray images]] are made to ensure he or she is not getting clinically worse.<ref>[http://www.clearpassage.com/small-bowel-obstruction.php Small Bowel Obstruction:  Treating Bowel Adhesions Non-Surgically] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227012047/http://www.clearpassage.com/small-bowel-obstruction.php |date=February 27, 2010 }}.

Conservative treatment involves insertion of a [[nasogastric tube]], correction of dehydration and [[electrolyte]] abnormalities. [[Opioid]] pain relievers may be used for patients with severe pain but alternate pain relievers are preferred as opioids can decrease bowel motility.<ref name=":04">{{Cite book |last1=Vercruysse |first1=Gary |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572336/ |title=Evaluation and Management of Mechanical Small Bowel Obstruction in Adults |last2=Busch |first2=Rebecca |last3=Dimcheff |first3=Derek |last4=Al-Hawary |first4=Mahmoud |last5=Saad |first5=Richard |last6=Seagull |first6=F.

Adhesive obstructions often settle without surgery. If the obstruction is complete surgery is usually required.

Most patients improve with conservative care in 2–5 days. When the obstruction is cancer, surgery is the only treatment. Those with [[bowel resection]] or [[lysis]] of adhesions usually stay in the hospital a few more days until they can eat and walk.<ref>[http://www.east.org/tpg/sbo.pdf  Small Bowel Obstruction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705063225/http://www.east.org/tpg/sbo.pdf |date=July 5, 2010 }} The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma.

Small bowel obstruction caused by [[Crohn's disease]], peritoneal [[carcinomatosis]], sclerosing [[peritonitis]], [[radiation enteritis]], and postpartum bowel obstruction are typically treated conservatively, i.e. without surgery.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for non-ischemic cases of SBO is good with mortality rates of 3–5%, while prognosis for SBO with ischemia is fair with mortality rates as high as 30%.<ref>{{cite conference |vauthors=Kakoza R, Lieberman G |title=Mechanical Small Bowel Obstruction |date=May 2006 |url=http://eradiology.bidmc.harvard.edu/LearningLab/gastro/Kakoza.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507080137/http://eradiology.bidmc.harvard.edu/LearningLab/gastro/Kakoza.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013  |access-date=October 9, 2012 }}</ref>

Cases of SBO related to cancer are more complicated and require additional intervention to address the [[malignancy]], recurrence, and [[metastasis]], and thus are associated with a more poor prognosis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/small-bowel-obstruction/| title=Small Bowel Obstruction|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= July 10, 2021}}</ref> Surgical options in patients with malignant bowel obstruction need to be considered carefully as while it may provide relief of symptoms in the short term, there is a high risk of mortality and re-obstruction.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Song |first1=Yun |last2=Metzger |first2=Daniel Aryeh |last3=Bruce |first3=Adrienne N. |last4=Krouse |first4=Robert S. |last5=Roses |first5=Robert E. |last6=Fraker |first6=Douglas L. |last7=Kelz |first7=Rachel R. |last8=Karakousis |first8=Giorgos C. |date=January 2022 |title=Surgical Outcomes in Patients With Malignant Small Bowel Obstruction: A National Cohort Study |url=https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/SLA.0000000000003890 |journal=Annals of Surgery |language=en |volume=275 |issue=1 |pages=e198–e205 |doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000003890 |pmid=32209901 |s2cid=214643950 |issn=0003-4932}}</ref>
