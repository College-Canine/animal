'''Cryptorchidism''', also known as '''undescended testis''', is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. The word is from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κρυπτός}} ({{transliteration|grc|kryptos}}) 'hidden' and {{lang|grc|ὄρχις}} ({{transliteration|el|orchis}}) 'testicle'. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=HM|last2=Elder|first2=JS|title=Cryptorchidism and testicular cancer: separating fact from fiction.|journal=The Journal of Urology|date=February 2009|volume=181|issue=2|pages=452–61|pmid=19084853|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2008.10.074}}</ref> About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/cryptorchidism/| title=Cryptorchidism|newspaper=Lecturio |access-date= 11 July 2021}}</ref>
However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life (the majority within three months), making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.
[[File:CryptorchidismForms.jpg|thumb|Different forms of cryptorchidism, depending on the position of the undescended testicle. Sometimes the retractile testicle is added.]]

Cryptorchidism is distinct from [[monorchism]], the condition of having only one testicle. Though the condition may occur on one or both sides, it more commonly affects the right testis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tamparo|first1=Carol|title=Diseases of the Human Body|url=https://archive.org/details/diseaseshumanbod00tamp|url-access=limited|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-8036-2505-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/diseaseshumanbod00tamp/page/n152 125]|edition=Fifth|year=2011}}</ref>

A testis absent from the normal scrotal position may be:
# Anywhere along the "path of descent" from high in the posterior (retroperitoneal) abdomen, just below the [[kidney]], to the [[Deep inguinal ring|inguinal ring]]
# In the [[inguinal canal]]
# Ectopic, having "wandered" from the path of descent, usually outside the inguinal canal and sometimes even under the skin of the thigh, the [[perineum]], the opposite scrotum, or the [[femoral canal]]
# Undeveloped (hypoplastic) or severely abnormal (dysgenetic)
# Missing (also see [[anorchia]]).

About two-thirds of cases without other abnormalities are unilateral; most of the other third involve both testes. In 90% of cases, an undescended testis can be felt in the inguinal canal. In a small minority of cases, missing testes may be found in the abdomen or appear to be nonexistent (truly "hidden").

Undescended testes are associated with reduced [[fertility]], increased risk of [[Germ cell tumor|testicular germ-cell tumors]], and psychological problems when fully-grown. Undescended testes are also more susceptible to [[testicular torsion]] (and subsequent infarction) and [[inguinal hernia]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}} Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend during the first year of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an [[orchiopexy]].<ref name="ADAM Encyclopedia 2022">{{cite encyclopedia | article=Undescended testicle |title=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia | date=31 July 2019 |location=Johns Creek, Georgia, USA |publisher=[[Ebix]] | url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000973.htm | access-date=9 February 2022}}</ref>

Although cryptorchidism nearly always refers to [[congenital]] absence or maldescent, a testis observed in the scrotum in early infancy can occasionally "reascend" (move back up) into the inguinal canal. A testis that can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal is referred to as retractile.

Cryptorchidism, [[hypospadias]], [[testicular cancer]], and poor [[semen quality]] make up the syndrome known as [[testicular dysgenesis syndrome]].

==Signs and symptoms==

===Infertility===
Many men who were born with undescended testes have reduced fertility, even after [[orchiopexy]] in infancy. The reduction with unilateral cryptorchidism is subtle, with a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported by the same study for the general population of adult men.

The fertility reduction after orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked, about 38%, or six times that of the general population. The basis for the universal recommendation for early surgery is research showing degeneration of [[spermatogenic]] tissue and reduced spermatogonia counts after the second year of life in undescended testes. The degree to which this is prevented or improved by early orchiopexy is still uncertain.

===Cancer risk===

One of the strongest arguments for early orchiopexy is reducing the risk of [[testicular cancer]]. About one in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a four- to 40-fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the third and fourth decades of life. The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The most common type of testicular cancer occurring in undescended testes is [[seminoma]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dähnert|first=Wolfgang|title=Radiology Review Manual|year=2011|location=995}}</ref> It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught [[testicular self-examination]], to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and one of the advantages of orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.

Orchidopexy was originally thought to result in easier detection of testicular cancer, but did not lower the risk of actually developing cancer.  However, recent data have shown a paradigm shift.  ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' published in 2007 that orchidopexy performed before puberty resulted in a significantly reduced risk of testicular cancer than if done after puberty.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pettersson|first=Andreas|author2=Lorenzo Richiardi |author3=Agneta Nordenskjold |author4=Magnus Kaijser |author5=Olof Akre |date=May 3, 2007|title=Age at Surgery for Undescended Testis and Risk of Testicular Cancer|journal=NEJM|volume=356|pages=1835–41|pmid=17476009|issue=18|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067588|hdl=2318/58479|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

The risk of malignancy in the undescended testis is 4 to 10 ten times higher than that in the general population and is about one in 80 with a unilateral undescended testis and one in 40 to one in 50 for bilateral undescended testes. The peak age for this tumor is 15–45 years old. The most common tumor developing in an undescended testis is a seminoma (65%); in contrast, after orchiopexy, seminomas represent only 30% of testicular tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leslie S, Sajjad H, Villanueva C|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470270/| title=Cryptorchidism|website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2021|pmid=29261861|access-date= 11 July 2021}}</ref>

==Causes==

=== Environmental hypotheses ===
In most full-term infant boys with cryptorchidism but no other genital abnormalities, a cause cannot be found, making this a common, sporadic, unexplained ([[idiopathic]]) birth defect. A combination of genetics, maternal health, and other environmental factors may disrupt the hormones and physical changes that influence the development of the testicles.
* Severely [[Premature birth|premature]] infants can be born before descent of testes.  Low birth weight is also a known factor.<ref name="mayoclinic.com">{{cite web|title=Undescended testicle - Symptoms and causes|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/undescended-testicle/symptoms-causes/syc-20351995|website=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>
* A contributing role of environmental [[chemical]]s called [[endocrine disruptor]]s that interfere with normal fetal hormone balance has been proposed.

*''[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]]'' generally manifests itself in Cryptorchidism. In [[Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome|CAIS]], the testis are generally located completely undescended where the [[ovaries]] usually are, in [[Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome|PAIS]], the testis are generally partially undescended. This also occurs with [[5α-Reductase 2 deficiency]] ([[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] insensitivity) however, the testis generally descend during [[puberty]].

In 2008, a study was published that investigated the possible relationship between cryptorchidism and prenatal exposure to a chemical called [[phthalate]] (DEHP), which is used in the manufacture of plastics. The researchers found a significant association between higher levels of DEHP metabolites in pregnant mothers and several sex-related changes, including incomplete descent of the testes in their sons.  According to the lead author of the study, a national survey found that 25% of U.S. women had phthalate levels similar to the levels that were found to be associated with sexual abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pelley|first1=Janet|journal=Environmental Science & Technology |title=Plasticizer may make boys less masculine |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/story/10.1021/on.2008.11.12.154968 |date=12 November 2008 |access-date=2019-01-20|doi=10.1021/on.2008.11.12.154968|doi-broken-date=31 January 2024}}</ref>

A 2010 study <!-- published in the European medical journal ''Human Reproduction'' --> examined the prevalence of congenital cryptorchidism among offspring whose mothers had taken mild [[analgesics]], primarily over-the-counter pain medications including [[ibuprofen]] (e.g. Advil) and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen).<ref name="humrep.oxfordjournals.org">{{cite journal|last1=Kristensen|first1=DM|last2=Hass|first2=U|last3=Lesné|first3=L|last4=Lottrup|first4=G|last5=Jacobsen|first5=PR|last6=Desdoits-Lethimonier|first6=C|last7=Boberg|first7=J|last8=Petersen|first8=JH|last9=Toppari|first9=J|last10=Jensen|first10=TK|last11=Brunak|first11=S|last12=Skakkebaek|first12=NE|last13=Nellemann|first13=C|last14=Main|first14=KM|last15=Jégou|first15=B|last16=Leffers|first16=H|title=Intrauterine exposure to mild analgesics is a risk factor for development of male reproductive disorders in human and rat|journal=[[Human Reproduction (journal)|Human Reproduction]]|date=January 2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=235–44|doi=10.1093/humrep/deq323 |doi-access=free |pmid=21059752}}</ref> Combining the results from a survey of pregnant women prior to their due date in correlation with the health of their children and an ''ex vivo'' rat model, the study found  that pregnant women who had been exposed to mild analgesics had a higher prevalence of baby boys born with congenital cryptorchidism.<ref name="humrep.oxfordjournals.org"/>

New insight into the testicular descent mechanism has been hypothesized by the concept of a male programming window derived from animal studies. According to this concept, testicular descent status is "set" during the period from 8 to 14 weeks of gestation in humans. Undescended testis is a result of disruption in androgen levels only during this programming window.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = M. | last2 = Saunders | first2 = P.

=== Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marker hypothesis ===
When one identical twin is born with cryptorchidism, his identical twin also has the trait only 25% of the time, despite sharing their genes and prenatal hormonal environment.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Rice |first=William R. |last2=Friberg |first2=Urban |last3=Gavrilets |first3=Sergey |date=2012 |title=Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development |url=http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Rice-et-al.-2012.pdf |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |language=en |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=355-356 |doi=10.1086/668167 |issn=0033-5770}}</ref> Animal studies have found that androgen antagonists during early fetal development cause elevated rates of hypospadias and cryptorchidism, however, in humans these traits rarely occur together.<ref name=":2" /> In addition, levels of circulating testosterone overlap for both male and female fetuses throughout fetal development. Rice et al. have proposed that sexually dimorphic development occurs through [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] markers which are laid down during stem cell development, which blunt androgen signalling in XX fetuses, and boost sensitivity in XY fetuses.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Rice |first=William R. |last2=Friberg |first2=Urban |last3=Gavrilets |first3=Sergey |date=2016 |title=Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development |url=http://volweb2.utk.edu/~gavrila/papers/mol_ecol_16.pdf |journal=Molecular Ecology |language=en |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1812–1822 |doi=10.1111/mec.13490 |issn=0962-1083}}</ref> If this marks are [[Sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic]], and if a subset of these epigenetic marks carry over generations, they are expected to produce mosaicism of sexual development in opposite-sex offspring, sometimes producing hypospadias or cryptorchidism when passed from a mother to son (feminizing the external genitalia). Rice's model requires further testing with currently available technology to support or falsify it.<ref name=":1" />

==Mechanism==

===Normal development===
The testes begin as an immigration of primordial [[germ cell]]s into testicular cords along the [[gonadal ridge]] in the abdomen of the early embryo. The interaction of several male [[gene]]s organizes this developing gonad into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the third to fifth months, the cells in the testes differentiate into [[testosterone]]-producing [[Leydig cell]]s, and [[anti-Müllerian hormone]]-producing [[Sertoli cell]]s. The germ cells in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develops during the third and fourth months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.
The testes remain high in the abdomen until the seventh month of gestation when they move from the abdomen through the inguinal canals into the two sides of the scrotum. Movement has been proposed to occur in two phases, under the control of somewhat different factors. The first phase, movement across the abdomen to the entrance of the inguinal canal, appears controlled (or at least greatly influenced) by anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The second phase, in which the testes move through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, is dependent on [[androgen]]s (most importantly testosterone). In rodents, androgens induce the [[genitofemoral nerve]] to release [[calcitonin gene-related peptide]], which produces rhythmic contractions of the [[gubernaculum]], a [[ligament]] which connects the testis to the scrotum, but a similar mechanism has not been demonstrated in humans. Maldevelopment of the gubernaculum or deficiency or insensitivity to either AMH or androgen can, therefore, prevent the testes from descending into the scrotum. Some evidence suggests an additional [[paracrine]] hormone, referred to as descendin, may be secreted by the testes.

In many infants with inguinal testes, further descent of the testes into the scrotum occurs in the first six months of life. This is attributed to the postnatal surge of [[gonadotropin]]s and testosterone that normally occurs between the first and fourth months of life.

[[Spermatogenesis]] continues after birth. In the third to fifth months of life, some of the fetal spermatogonia residing along the [[basement membrane]] become type A spermatogonia. More gradually, other fetal spermatogonia become type B spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes by the fifth year after birth. Spermatogenesis arrests at this stage until [[puberty]].

Most normal-appearing undescended testes are also normal by microscopic examination, but reduced spermatogonia can be found. The tissue in undescended testes becomes more markedly abnormal ("degenerates") in microscopic appearance between two and four years after birth. Some evidence indicates early orchiopexy reduces this degeneration.

===Pathophysiology===
At least one contributing mechanism for reduced [[spermatogenesis]] in cryptorchid testes is temperature. The temperature of testes in the scrotum is at least a few degrees cooler than in the abdomen. Animal experiments in the middle of the 20th century suggested that raising the temperature could damage fertility. Some circumstantial evidence suggests tight underwear and other practices that raise the testicular temperature for prolonged periods can be associated with lower [[sperm count]]s. Nevertheless, research in recent decades suggests that the issue of fertility is more complex than a simple matter of temperature. Subtle or transient hormone deficiencies or other factors that lead to a lack of descent also may impair the development of spermatogenic tissue.

The inhibition of spermatogenesis by ordinary intra-abdominal temperature is so potent that continual suspension of normal testes tightly against the inguinal ring at the top of the scrotum by means of special "suspensory briefs" has been researched as a method of [[male contraception]], and was referred to as "artificial cryptorchidism" by one report.

An additional factor contributing to infertility is the high rate of anomalies of the [[epididymis]] in boys with cryptorchidism (over 90% in some studies). Even after orchiopexy, these may also affect sperm maturation and motility at an older age.

==Diagnosis==

[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of undescended testis.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Scrotal ultrasonography]] of undescended testis: (a) Normal testis in the scrotum (b) Atrophic and decreased echogenicity of the contralateral testis of the same patient seen in the inguinal region{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}]]

The most common diagnostic dilemma in otherwise normal boys is distinguishing a [[retractile testis]] from a testis that will not descend spontaneously into the scrotum. Retractile testes are more common than truly undescended testes and do not need to be operated on. In normal males, as the [[cremaster muscle]] relaxes or contracts, the testis moves lower or higher ("retracts") in the scrotum. This [[cremasteric reflex]] is much more active in infant boys than older men. A retractile testis high in the scrotum can be difficult to distinguish from a position in the lower inguinal canal. Though various maneuvers are used to do so, such as using a cross-legged position, soaping the examiner's fingers, or examining in a warm bath, the benefit of surgery in these cases can be a matter of clinical judgment.

In the minority of cases with bilaterally nonpalpable testes, further testing to locate the testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. [[Scrotal ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. At ultrasound, the undescended testis usually appears small, less echogenic than the contralateral normal testis and usually located in the inguinal region.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  With color [[Doppler ultrasonography]], the vascularity of the undescended testis is poor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

A [[karyotype]] can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary hypogonadism, such as [[Klinefelter syndrome]] or [[mixed gonadal dysgenesis]]. Hormone levels (especially gonadotropins and AMH) can help confirm that hormonally functional testes are worth attempting to rescue, as can stimulation with a few injections of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] to elicit a rise of the testosterone level. Occasionally, these tests reveal an unsuspected and more complicated [[intersex]] condition.

In the even smaller minority of cryptorchid infants who have other obvious birth defects of the genitalia, further testing is crucial and has a high likelihood of detecting an intersex condition or other anatomic anomalies. Ambiguity can indicate either impaired androgen synthesis or [[androgen insensitivity syndrome|reduced sensitivity]]. The presence of a [[uterus]] by pelvic [[ultrasound]] suggests either [[persistent Müllerian duct syndrome]] (AMH deficiency or insensitivity) or a severely virilized genetic female with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. An unambiguous [[micropenis]], especially accompanied by [[hypoglycemia]] or [[jaundice]], suggests congenital [[hypopituitarism]].

==Treatment==
{{Intersex sidebar}}

The primary management of cryptorchidism is [[watchful waiting]], due to the high likelihood of self-resolution. Where this fails, [[orchiopexy]] is effective if inguinal testes have not descended after 4–6 months.  Surgery is often performed by a [[pediatric urologist]] or [[pediatric surgeon]], but in many communities still by a general [[urologist]] or surgeon.

When the undescended testis is in the inguinal canal, hormonal therapy is sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. The most commonly used hormone therapy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). A series of hCG injections (10 injections over five weeks is common) is given and the status of the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. Although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5% to 50%, probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. Hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of Leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone by the end of the injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of [[GnRH analog]]s such as [[nafarelin]] or [[buserelin]]; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. Nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble, since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated.

In cases where the testes are identified preoperatively in the inguinal canal, orchiopexy is often performed as an outpatient and has a very low complication rate. An incision is made over the inguinal canal. The testis with accompanying cord structure and blood supply is exposed, partially separated from the surrounding tissues ("mobilized"), and brought into the scrotum. It is sutured to the scrotal tissue or enclosed in a "subdartos pouch". The associated passage back into the inguinal canal, an [[inguinal hernia]], is closed to prevent reascent.
In patients with intra-abdominal maldescended testis, laparoscopy is useful to see for oneself the pelvic structures, position of the testis and decide upon surgery (single or staged procedure ).

Surgery becomes more complicated if the blood supply is not ample and elastic enough to be stretched into the scrotum. In these cases, the supply may be divided, some vessels sacrificed with expectation of adequate [[collateral circulation]]. In the worst case, the testis must be "autotransplanted" into the scrotum, with all connecting blood vessels cut and reconnected ([[anastomosis|anastomosed]]).

When the testis is in the abdomen, the first stage of surgery is exploration to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multistage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. Just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is nonexistent ([[vanishing testes syndrome|"vanished"]]), or dysplastic and not salvageable.

The principal major complication of all types of orchiopexy is a loss of the blood supply to the testis, resulting in loss of the testis due to [[ischemia|ischemic]] [[atrophy]] or [[fibrosis]].

Because it is an inherited trait, affected dogs should not be bred and should be [[spaying and neutering|castrated]].  The parents should be considered carriers of the defect and a breeder should thoughtfully consider whether to breed the carrier parent or not.  Littermates may be normal, carriers, or cryptorchid.  Castration of the undescended teste(s) should be considered for cryptorchid dogs due to the high rate of testicular cancer, especially [[Sertoli cell tumor]]s.<ref name=IVIS/>  The incidence of testicular cancer is 13.6 times higher in dogs with abdominally retained testicles compared with normal dogs.<ref name=AVMA/>  [[Testicular torsion]] is also more likely in retained testicles.  Surgical correction is by palpation of the retained testicle and subsequent exploration of the inguinal canal or abdomen, but showing altered dogs is against AKC rules, making this correction pointless for breeding stock. Orchiopexy is an option for pet dogs that will not be used for breeding.

===Cats===
Cryptorchidism is rarer in cats than it is in dogs. In one study, 1.9% of intact male cats were cryptorchid.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott K, Levy J, Crawford P |title=Characteristics of free-roaming cats evaluated in a trap-neuter-return program |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=221 |issue=8 |pages=1136–38 |year=2002 |pmid=12387382 |doi=10.2460/javma.2002.221.1136}}</ref>  [[Persian (cat)|Persian]]s are predisposed.<ref name=Foley_2005>{{cite book|editor=August, John R.|chapter=Diagnostic usefulness of and clinical syndromes associated with reproductive hormones|author=Griffin, Brenda|title=Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine Vol. 5|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7216-0423-7}}</ref>  Normally, the testicles are in the scrotum by the age of six to eight weeks.

Testicular tumors and testicular torsion are rare in cryptorchid cats, but castration is usually performed due to unwanted behavior such as urine spraying.

===Horses===
In horses, cryptorchidism is sufficiently common that affected males ([[ridgling]]s) are routinely [[gelding|gelded]].

Rarely, cryptorchidism is due to the presence of a [[congenital]] [[testicular cancer|testicular tumor]] such as a [[teratoma]], which has a tendency to grow large.<ref>{{cite book|title=Veterinary pathology|author1=Jones, T.
