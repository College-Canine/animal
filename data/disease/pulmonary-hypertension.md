==Causes==
Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic condition with many possible causes. Indeed, this condition frequently accompanies severe heart or lung conditions.<ref name=pmid26320113/> A 1973 [[World Health Organization]] meeting was the first attempt to classify pulmonary hypertension by its cause, and a distinction was made between primary PH (resulting from a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary PH (resulting secondary to other, non-vascular causes). Further, primary PH was divided into the "arterial plexiform", "veno-occlusive" and "thromboembolic" forms.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Hatano S, Strasser R | title=Primary pulmonary hypertension | publisher=World Health Organization | location=Geneva | year=1975}}</ref> In 1998, a second conference at [[Évian-les-Bains]] addressed the causes of secondary PH.<ref>{{cite book  |vauthors=Rich S, Rubin LJ, Abenhail L, etal | title=Executive summary from the World Symposium on Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (Evian, France, September 6–10, 1998) | publisher=The World Health Organization | location=Geneva | year=1998 |url=https://www.who.int/ncd/cvd/pph.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020408173726/http://www.who.int/ncd/cvd/pph.html | archive-date=April 8, 2002}}</ref> Subsequent third,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonneau G, Galiè N, Rubin LJ, Langleben D, Seeger W, Domenighetti G, Gibbs S, Lebrec D, Speich R, Beghetti M, Rich S, Fishman A | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 Suppl S | pages = 5S–12S | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15194173 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.02.037 | doi-access = free }}</ref> fourth,<ref name=pmid19555858>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonneau G, Robbins IM, Beghetti M, Channick RN, Delcroix M, Denton CP, Elliott CG, Gaine SP, Gladwin MT, Jing ZC, Krowka MJ, Langleben D, Nakanishi N, Souza R | display-authors = 6 | title = Updated clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S43–S54 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19555858 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.012 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and fifth (2013)<ref name=pmid24355639>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonneau G, Gatzoulis MA, Adatia I, Celermajer D, Denton C, Ghofrani A, Gomez Sanchez MA, Krishna Kumar R, Landzberg M, Machado RF, Olschewski H, Robbins IM, Souza R | display-authors = 6 | title = Updated clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 62 | issue = 25 Suppl | pages = D34–D41 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24355639 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.029 | doi-access = free }}</ref> World Symposia on PAH have further defined the classification of PH.

The pathogenesis of pulmonary ''arterial'' hypertension (WHO Group I) involves the [[Vasoconstrictor|narrowing of blood vessels]] connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the [[lungs]], as it is much harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become stiffer and thicker, in a process known as [[fibrosis]]. The mechanisms involved in this narrowing process include [[vasoconstriction]], [[thrombosis]], and vascular remodeling (excessive cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and reduced apoptosis/programmed cell death in the vessel walls, caused by [[inflammation]], disordered [[metabolism]] and dysregulation of certain [[growth factors]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob AS, Nielsen DH, Gianelly RE | title = Fatal ventricular fibrillation following verapamil in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–160 | date = February 1985 | pmid = 3970402 | pmc = 3970402 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.025 }}</ref><ref name="Vonk-Noordegraaf A 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vonk-Noordegraaf A, Haddad F, Chin KM, Forfia PR, Kawut SM, Lumens J, Naeije R, Newman J, Oudiz RJ, Provencher S, Torbicki A, Voelkel NF, Hassoun PM | display-authors = 6 | title = Right heart adaptation to pulmonary arterial hypertension: physiology and pathobiology | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 62 | issue = 25 Suppl | pages = D22–D33 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24355638 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.027 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn occurs when the circulatory system of a newborn baby fails to adapt to life outside the womb; it is characterized by high resistance to blood flow through the lungs, right-to-left cardiac shunting and severe [[hypoxemia]].<ref name=pmid19389575/>

Pathogenesis in pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (WHO Group II) is completely different in that constriction or damage to the pulmonary blood vessels is not the issue. Instead, the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently, leading to pooling of blood in the lungs and back pressure within the pulmonary system. This causes [[pulmonary edema]] and [[pleural effusion]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guazzi M, Galiè N | title = Pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease | journal = European Respiratory Review | volume = 21 | issue = 126 | pages = 338–346 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23204122 | pmc = 9487233 | doi = 10.1183/09059180.00004612 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In the absence of pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, the increased back pressure is described as 'isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension' (older terms include 'passive' or 'proportionate' pulmonary hypertension or 'pulmonary venous hypertension').

This is referred to as 'post-capillary pulmonary hypertension with a pre-capillary component' or 'combined post-capillary and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension' (older terms include 'reactive' or 'out-of-proportion' pulmonary hypertension).<ref name=pmid26320113/><ref name=pmid22884380/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vachiéry JL, Adir Y, Barberà JA, Champion H, Coghlan JG, Cottin V, De Marco T, Galiè N, Ghio S, Gibbs JS, Martinez F, Semigran M, Simonneau G, Wells A, Seeger W | display-authors = 6 | title = Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart diseases | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 62 | issue = 25 Suppl | pages = D100–D108 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24355634 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.033 | hdl-access = free | doi-access = free | hdl = 11585/534481 }}</ref>

In pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (WHO Group III), low levels of oxygen in the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] (due to respiratory disease or living at high altitude) cause constriction of the pulmonary arteries. This phenomenon is called [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]] and it is initially a protective response to stop too much blood flowing to areas of the lung that are damaged and do not contain oxygen. When the alveolar hypoxia is widespread and prolonged, this hypoxia-mediated vasoconstriction occurs across a large portion of the pulmonary vascular bed and leads to an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, with thickening of the pulmonary vessel walls contributing to the development of sustained pulmonary hypertension.<ref name=pmid19555858/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shanks N, Macklin J, Coles S | title = Comparison of oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate and clavulanate-potentiated amoxicillin in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 812–819 | year = 2009 | pmid = 2692823 | pmc = 2692823 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2009.02.006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer N, Dietrich A, Schermuly RT, Ghofrani HA, Gudermann T, Schulz R, Seeger W, Grimminger F, Weissmann N | display-authors = 6 | title = Regulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: basic mechanisms | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1639–1651 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19043010 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.00013908 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stenmark KR, Fagan KA, Frid MG | title = Hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling: cellular and molecular mechanisms | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 675–691 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17008597 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000243584.45145.3f | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Prolonged hypoxia also induces the transcription factor [[HIF1A]], which directly activates downstream growth factor signaling that causes irreversible proliferation and remodeling of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, leading to chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH (WHO Group IV), the initiating event is thought to be blockage or narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels with unresolved blood clots; these clots can lead to increased pressure and [[shear stress]] in the rest of the pulmonary circulation, precipitating structural changes in the vessel walls (remodeling) similar to those observed in other types of severe pulmonary hypertension.

===Molecular pathology===
[[File:Molecular Pathology.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Three major signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension]]
The molecular mechanism of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is not known yet, but it is believed that the endothelial dysfunction results in a decrease in the synthesis of endothelium-derived vasodilators such as [[nitric oxide]] and [[prostacyclin]].<ref name=pmid14734504>{{cite journal | vauthors = Budhiraja R, Tuder RM, Hassoun PM | title = Endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension | journal = Circulation | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–165 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14734504 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.0000102381.57477.50 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Moreover, there is a stimulation of the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as [[thromboxane]] and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These result in a severe vasoconstriction and [[vascular smooth muscle]]  and [[adventitial]] hypertrophy characteristic of patients with PAH.<ref name=pmid14734504/>

====Nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase pathway====
In normal conditions, the vascular [[endothelial nitric oxide synthase]] produces nitric oxide from L-arginine in the presence of oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Förstermann U, Münzel T | title = Endothelial nitric oxide synthase in vascular disease: from marvel to menace | journal = Circulation | volume = 113 | issue = 13 | pages = 1708–1714 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16585403 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.602532 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

This nitric oxide diffuses into neighboring cells (including vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets), where it increases the activity of the enzyme [[soluble guanylate cyclase]], leading to increased formation of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murad F | title = Shattuck Lecture.

Activated PKG promotes vasorelaxation (via a reduction of intracellular calcium levels), alters the expression of genes involved in smooth muscle cell contraction, [[Cell migration|migration]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and inhibits [[platelet]] activation.<ref name="Francis SH, Busch JL, Corbin JD, Sibley D 2010 525–63">{{cite journal | vauthors = Francis SH, Busch JL, Corbin JD, Sibley D | title = cGMP-dependent protein kinases and cGMP phosphodiesterases in nitric oxide and cGMP action | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 525–563 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20716671 | pmc = 2964902 | doi = 10.1124/pr.110.002907 }}</ref> Nitric oxide–soluble guanylate cyclase signaling also leads to anti-inflammatory effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zelia OP, Kovalenko FP | title = [Comparative efficiency of infecting laboratory animals via intravenous and subcutaneous administration of Schistosoma mansoni cercaria] | journal = Parazitologiia | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–465 | year = 2011 | pmid = 3103045 }}</ref>

Phosphodiesterase type 5 ([[PDE5]]), which is abundant in the pulmonary tissue, hydrolyzes the cyclic bond of cGMP. Consequently, the concentration of cGMP (and thus PKG activity) decreases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghofrani HA, Pepke-Zaba J, Barbera JA, Channick R, Keogh AM, Gomez-Sanchez MA, Kneussl M, Grimminger F | display-authors = 6 | title = Nitric oxide pathway and phosphodiesterase inhibitors in pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 Suppl S | pages = 68S–72S | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15194181 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.02.031 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Francis SH, Busch JL, Corbin JD, Sibley D 2010 525–63"/>

====Endothelin====

[[Endothelin-1]] is a peptide (comprising 21 amino acids) that is produced in endothelial cells. It acts on the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB in various cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, leading to vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It also acts on ETB receptors in endothelial cells; this leads to the release of both vasoconstrictors and vasodilators from those cells, and clears endothelin-1 from the system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McLaughlin VV, McGoon MD | title = Pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = Circulation | volume = 114 | issue = 13 | pages = 1417–1431 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17000921 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.503540 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonseca C, Abraham D, Renzoni EA | title = Endothelin in pulmonary fibrosis | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20448055 | doi = 10.1165/rcmb.2009-0388TR }}</ref>

====Prostacyclin and thromboxane====

[[Prostacyclin]] is synthesized from arachidonic acid in endothelial cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, prostacyclin binds mainly to the prostaglandin I receptor. This sends a signal to increase adenylate cyclase activity, which leads to increased synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This in turn leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase or [[Protein kinase A|PKA]] (protein kinase A) activity, ultimately promoting vasodilation and inhibiting cell proliferation. Prostacyclin signaling also leads to anti-thrombotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Levels of cAMP (which mediates most of the biological effects of prostacyclin) are reduced by [[phosphodiesterases]] 3 and 4.<ref name="Archer SL 2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wood SF | title = Astemizole and terfenadine compared in hay fever | journal = The Practitioner | volume = 230 | issue = 1411 | pages = 41–44 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 2869481 | pmc = 2869481 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.847707 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gomberg-Maitland M, Olschewski H | title = Prostacyclin therapies for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 891–901 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378784 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.00097107 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
The vasoconstrictor thromboxane is also synthesized from arachidonic acid. In PAH, the balance is shifted away from synthesis of prostacyclin toward synthesis of thromboxane.<ref name="Archer SL 2010"/>

====Other pathways====

The three pathways described above are all targeted by currently available medical therapies for PAH. However, several other pathways have been identified that are also altered in PAH and are being investigated as potential targets for future therapies. For example, the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase]] (PDK) is pathologically activated in PAH, causing a metabolic shift from [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to [[glycolysis]] and leading to increased cell proliferation and impaired apoptosis.<ref name="Archer SL 2010"/><ref name="Gomberg-Maitland M 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenfant M | title = [Dihydrostreptomycin fixation on the ribosomes of E. coli] | journal = Biochimie | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–285 | year = 2013 | pmid = 4117578 | pmc = 4117578 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.10.026 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide, a potent vasodilator with anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory roles, is reduced in PAH, while expression of its receptor is increased.<ref name="Archer SL 2010"/><ref name="Gomberg-Maitland M 2013"/>

[[File:PulArtHyperandEmphysemaMark.png|thumb|Pulmonary artery hypertension and emphysema as seen on a CT scan with contrast]]
Signs of pulmonary hypertension on [[CT scan]] of the chest are:

Although pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) can be estimated on the basis of [[echocardiography]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bossone E, D'Andrea A, D'Alto M, Citro R, Argiento P, Ferrara F, Cittadini A, Rubenfire M, Naeije R | display-authors = 6 | title = Echocardiography in pulmonary arterial hypertension: from diagnosis to prognosis | journal = Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23140849 | doi = 10.1016/j.echo.2012.10.009 }}</ref> pressure measurements with a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right side of the heart provide the most definite assessment.[42] Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean PAP of at least 20&nbsp;mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest, and PAH is defined as precapillary pulmonary hypertension (i.e. mean PAP ≥ 20&nbsp;mm Hg with pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] ≤ 15&nbsp;mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] > 3 Wood Units).<ref name=pmid24355641/> PAOP and PVR cannot be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires right-sided cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output; this can be used to calculate the cardiac index, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.<ref name=pmid26320113/><ref>Swan-Ganz – right heart catheterization: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia. Accessed: 2015-12-30</ref>
''Mean'' PAP (mPAP) should not be confused with systolic PAP (sPAP), which is often reported on echocardiogram reports. A systolic pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg typically implies a mean pressure of more than 25&nbsp;mm Hg. Roughly, mPAP = 0.61•sPAP + 2.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Khouri SJ, Pandya U | date = 2012 | chapter = Pulmonary hypertension. | veditors = Garcia MJ | title = NonInvasive cardiovascular imaging: a multimodality approach | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | pages = 655–668 }}</ref> Due to the invasive nature of this procedure, the use of computational fluid dynamics based hemodynamic indices have been postulated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Piskin S, Patnaik SS, Han D, Bordones AD, Murali S, Finol EA | title = A canonical correlation analysis of the relationship between clinical attributes and patient-specific hemodynamic indices in adult pulmonary hypertension | journal = Medical Engineering & Physics | volume = 77 | pages = 1–9 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 32007361 | pmc = 7069525 | doi = 10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.01.006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pillalamarri NR, Piskin S, Patnaik SS, Murali S, Finol EA | title = Patient-Specific Computational Analysis of Hemodynamics in Adult Pulmonary Hypertension | journal = Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 3465–3480 | date = December 2021 | pmid = 34799807 | pmc = 8684831 | doi = 10.1007/s10439-021-02884-y }}</ref>

===Other===
For people considered likely to have PAH based on the above tests, the specific associated condition is then determined based on the physical examination, medical/family history and further specific diagnostic tests (for example, [[serological]] tests to detect underlying connective tissue disease, HIV infection or hepatitis, [[ultrasonography]] to confirm the presence of portal hypertension, echocardiography/cardiac [[magnetic resonance imaging]] for congenital heart disease, laboratory tests for schistosomiasis, and high-resolution CT for PVOD and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis). Routine lung biopsy is discouraged in patients with PAH, because of the risk to the patient and because the findings are unlikely to alter the diagnosis and treatment.<ref name=pmid26320113/><ref name="Galie N 2009"/><ref name=pmid24355641/>

==Treatment==
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the [[mitral valve]] or [[aortic valve]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = How Is Pulmonary Hypertension Treated? – NHLBI, NIH|url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pah/treatment|website = www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date = 2015-12-30|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180457/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pah/treatment|archive-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref> Patients with left heart failure or [[Hypoxemia|hypoxemic]] lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.<ref name="ACCPandATSfive">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Chest Physicians |author1-link = American College of Chest Physicians |author2 = American Thoracic Society |author2-link = American Thoracic Society |date = September 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Chest Physicians and American Thoracic Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-chest-physicians-and-american-thoracic-society/ |access-date = 6 January 2013 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103063427/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-chest-physicians-and-american-thoracic-society/ |archive-date = 3 November 2013 }}, which cites

High-dose [[calcium channel blocker]]s are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are ''vasoreactive'' by [[Swan-Ganz catheter]].

'''Exercise-based rehabilitation'''

A 2023 Cochrane review found that exercise-based rehabilitation may lead to a large increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in [[health related quality of life]], without significantly increasing adverse events.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris NR, Kermeen FD, Jones AW, Lee JY, Holland AE | title = Exercise-based rehabilitation programmes for pulmonary hypertension | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2023 | issue = 3 | pages = CD011285 | date = March 2023 | pmid = 36947725 | pmc = 10032353 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011285.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Airways Group }}</ref>

===Vasoactive substances===
Many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the [[smooth muscle]] cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs — [[endothelin receptor antagonist]]s, [[phosphodiesterase]] type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raja SG, Raja SM | title = Treating pulmonary arterial hypertension: current treatments and future prospects | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 359–370 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 23251761 | pmc = 3513893 | doi = 10.1177/2040622311420773 }}</ref>

====Prostaglandins====
[[Prostacyclin]] ([[prostaglandin]] I<sub>2</sub>) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. [[Epoprostenol]] (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent [[central venous catheter]]. This delivery system can cause [[sepsis]] and [[thrombosis]]. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Safdar Z | title = Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: the role of prostacyclin and prostaglandin analogs | journal = Respiratory Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 6 | pages = 818–827 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21273054 | doi = 10.1016/j.rmed.2010.12.018 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Other [[prostanoid]]s have therefore been developed. [[Treprostinil]] can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. [[Iloprost]] is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=022387 | title=Drugs@FDA: FDA-Approved Drugs }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
[[File:Heart - cor pulmonale- right ventricular hypertrophy (4351912426).jpg|thumb|Cor pulmonale]]
PAH is considered a universally fatal illness, although survival time may vary between individuals. The prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) has an ''untreated'' median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure ([[cor pulmonale]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pulmonary Hypertension.

==Epidemiology==
The epidemiology of IPAH is about 125–150 deaths per year in the U.S., and worldwide the incidence is similar at 4 cases per million. However, in parts of Europe (France), indications are 6 cases per million of IPAH. Females have a higher incidence rate than males (2–9:1).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oudiz RJ | title=Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology | website=Medscape Reference | date=6 February 2023 | url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301450-overview#a6?form=fpf}}</ref>
