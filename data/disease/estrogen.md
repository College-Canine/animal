In addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as [[medication]]s, for instance in [[menopausal hormone therapy]], [[hormonal birth control]] and [[feminizing hormone therapy]] for [[Trans woman|transgender women]], intersex people, and [[Non-binary gender|nonbinary people]].

Synthetic and natural estrogens have been found in the environment and are referred to as [[xenoestrogen]]s. Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and can cause health issues and reproductive disfunction in both wildlife and humans.<ref name="Wang_2008" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44957536 |title=Reproductive and developmental toxicology |date=1998 |publisher=Marcel Dekker | vauthors = Korach KD |isbn=0-585-15807-X |location=New York |oclc=44957536}}</ref>

{{Chemical structures of major endogenous estrogens|align=right|caption=Note the [[hydroxyl group|hydroxyl]] (–OH) [[functional group|group]]s: estrone (E1) has one, estradiol (E2) has two, estriol (E3) has three, and estetrol (E4) has four.}}

The four major naturally occurring estrogens are [[estrone]] (E1), [[estradiol]] (E2), [[estriol]] (E3), and [[estetrol]] (E4). Estradiol (E2) is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During [[menopause]], estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Given by [[subcutaneous injection]] in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol.<ref name="Labhart2012">{{cite book|author=A. Labhart|title=Clinical Endocrinology: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAgJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA548|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-96158-8|pages=548–}}</ref> Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the [[menarche]] and menopause stages of life. However, during [[pregnancy]] this role shifts to estriol, and postmenopause, estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called [[estetrol]] (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from [[androgen]]s, specifically [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], by the [[enzyme]] [[aromatase]].

Minor endogenous estrogens, the biosyntheses of which do not involve [[aromatase]], include [[27-hydroxycholesterol]], [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[7-oxo-DHEA]], [[7α-hydroxy-DHEA]], [[16α-hydroxy-DHEA]], [[7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone]], [[androstenedione]] (A4), [[androstenediol]] (A5), [[3α-androstanediol]], and [[3β-androstanediol]].<ref name="pmid23313336">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker ME | title = What are the physiological estrogens? | journal = Steroids | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–340 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23313336 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2012.12.011 | s2cid = 11803629 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23123738">{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller KK, Al-Rayyan N, Ivanova MM, Mattingly KA, Ripp SL, Klinge CM, Prough RA | title = DHEA metabolites activate estrogen receptors alpha and beta | journal = Steroids | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–25 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23123738 | pmc = 3529809 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2012.10.002 }}</ref> Some estrogen metabolites, such as the [[catechol estrogen]]s [[2-hydroxyestradiol]], [[2-hydroxyestrone]], [[4-hydroxyestradiol]], and [[4-hydroxyestrone]], as well as [[16α-hydroxyestrone]], are also estrogens with varying degrees of activity.<ref name="pmid10865186">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhavnani BR, Nisker JA, Martin J, Aletebi F, Watson L, Milne JK | title = Comparison of pharmacokinetics of a conjugated equine estrogen preparation (premarin) and a synthetic mixture of estrogens (C.E.S.) in postmenopausal women | journal = Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–183 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10865186 | doi = 10.1016/s1071-5576(00)00049-6 }}</ref> The biological importance of these minor estrogens is not entirely clear.

The actions of estrogen are mediated by the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls [[gene expression]]. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a [[hormone response element]] to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified).<ref name="pmid15345050">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin CY, Ström A, Vega VB, Kong SL, Yeo AL, Thomsen JS, Chan WC, Doray B, Bangarusamy DK, Ramasamy A, Vergara LA, Tang S, Chong A, Bajic VB, Miller LD, Gustafsson JA, Liu ET | display-authors = 6 | title = Discovery of estrogen receptor alpha target genes and response elements in breast tumor cells | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = R66 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15345050 | pmc = 522873 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r66 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell.

===Female pubertal development===
Estrogens are responsible for the development of female [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s during [[puberty]], including [[breast development]], widening of the [[hip]]s, and female [[fat distribution]]. Conversely, [[androgen]]s are responsible for [[pubic hair|pubic]] and [[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], as well as [[acne]] and [[body odor|axillary odor]].

====Breast development====
{{See also|Breast development#Biochemistry}}

Estrogen, in conjunction with [[growth hormone]] (GH) and its secretory product [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), is critical in mediating breast development during [[puberty]], as well as breast maturation during [[pregnancy]] in preparation of [[lactation]] and [[breastfeeding]].<ref name="Malley2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brisken C, O'Malley B | title = Hormone action in the mammary gland | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = a003178 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20739412 | pmc = 2982168 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003178 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9516076">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinberg DL | title = Role of IGF-I in normal mammary development | journal = Breast Cancer Research and Treatment | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–208 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9516076 | doi = 10.1023/a:1005998832636 | s2cid = 30440069 }}</ref> Estrogen is primarily and directly responsible for inducing the ductal component of breast development,<ref name="Johnson2003">{{cite book | vauthors = Johnson LR | title = Essential Medical Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j9e-tkdHeUoC&pg=PA770 | year = 2003 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-387584-6 | pages = 770 }}</ref><ref name="NormanHenry2014">{{cite book | vauthors = Norman AW, Henry HL | title = Hormones | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_renonjXq68C&pg=PA311 | date = 30 July 2014|publisher=Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-08-091906-5 | pages = 311 }}</ref><ref name="CoadDunstall2011">{{cite book | vauthors = Coad J, Dunstall M | title = Anatomy and Physiology for Midwives, with Pageburst online access,3: Anatomy and Physiology for Midwives | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OmSKoYD-iW0C&pg=PA413 | year = 2011 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-7020-3489-3 | pages = 413 }}</ref> as well as for causing [[fat deposition]] and [[connective tissue]] growth.<ref name="Johnson2003" /><ref name="NormanHenry2014" /> It is also indirectly involved in the lobuloalveolar component, by increasing [[progesterone receptor]] expression in the breasts<ref name="Johnson2003" /><ref name="CoadDunstall2011" /><ref name="HaslamOsuch2006">{{cite book | vauthors = Haslam SZ, Osuch JR | title = Hormones and Breast Cancer in Post-Menopausal Women | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wGaKtDw50K0C&pg=PA69 | date = 1 January 2006 | publisher=IOS Press | isbn = 978-1-58603-653-9 | pages = 69 }}</ref> and by inducing the secretion of [[prolactin]].<ref name="SilbernaglDespopoulos2011">{{cite book | vauthors = Silbernagl S, Despopoulos A | title = Color Atlas of Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WyuCGhv4kvwC&pg=PA305 | date = 1 January 2011 | publisher = Thieme | isbn = 978-3-13-149521-1 | pages = 305– }}</ref><ref name="Fadem2007">{{cite book| vauthors = Fadem B | title = High-yield Comprehensive USMLE Step 1 Review | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d-MxROzDPgcC&pg=PA445 | year = 2007 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn = 978-0-7817-7427-7 | pages = 445– }}</ref> Allowed for by estrogen, [[progesterone]] and prolactin work together to complete lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.<ref name="NormanHenry2014" /><ref name="Blackburn2014">{{cite book | vauthors = Blackburn S | title = Maternal, Fetal, & Neonatal Physiology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RNLsAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA146 | date = 14 April 2014 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-323-29296-2 | pages = 146– }}</ref>

===Female reproductive system===
Estrogens are responsible for maturation and maintenance of the [[vagina]] and [[uterus]], and are also involved in [[ovary|ovarian]] function, such as maturation of [[ovarian follicle]]s. In addition, estrogens play an important role in regulation of [[gonadotropin]] [[secretion]]. For these reasons, estrogens are required for female [[fertility]].

====Sex drive====
{{See also|Sexual motivation and hormones}}

Estrogens are involved in [[libido]] (sex drive) in both women and men.

====Cognition====
[[Verbal memory]] scores are frequently used as one measure of higher level [[cognition]]. These scores vary in direct proportion to estrogen levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Furthermore, estrogens when administered shortly after natural or surgical menopause prevents decreases in verbal memory.

Compulsions in male lab mice, such as those in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme [[aromatase]] in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. [[Hypothalamus|Hypothalamic]] protein levels in the gene [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]] are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity.

Local application of estrogen in the rat hippocampus has been shown to inhibit the re-uptake of [[serotonin]].

It is also suggested that there is an interaction between hormone levels and eating at different points in the female [[menstrual cycle]]. Research has predicted increased emotional eating during hormonal flux, which is characterized by high [[progesterone]] and [[estradiol]] levels that occur during the mid-[[luteal phase]]. It is hypothesized that these changes occur due to brain changes across the menstrual cycle that are likely a genomic effect of hormones. These effects produce menstrual cycle changes, which result in hormone release leading to behavioral changes, notably binge and emotional eating. These occur especially prominently among women who are genetically vulnerable to binge eating phenotypes.<ref name=Klump2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klump KL, Keel PK, Racine SE, Burt SA, Burt AS, Neale M, Sisk CL, Boker S, Hu JY | display-authors = 6 | title = The interactive effects of estrogen and progesterone on changes in emotional eating across the menstrual cycle | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–137 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22889242 | pmc = 3570621 | doi = 10.1037/a0029524 }}</ref>

In females, synthesis of estrogens starts in [[theca interna]] cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of [[androstenedione]] from [[cholesterol]]. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the [[basal membrane]] into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack [[17α-hydroxylase]] and [[17,20-lyase]], whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.

Estrogen levels vary through the [[menstrual cycle]], with levels highest near the end of the [[follicular phase]] just before [[ovulation]].

Note that in males, estrogen is also produced by the [[Sertoli cell]]s when FSH binds to their FSH receptors.

===Distribution===
Estrogens are [[plasma protein binding|plasma protein bound]] to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] and/or [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] in the circulation.

===Metabolism===
{{See also|Estradiol#Metabolism|Estradiol (medication)#Metabolism}}

Estrogens are [[metabolism|metabolized]] via [[hydroxylation]] by [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s such as [[CYP1A1]] and [[CYP3A4]] and via [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugation]] by [[estrogen sulfotransferase]]s ([[sulfation]]) and [[UDP-glucuronyltransferase]]s ([[glucuronidation]]). In addition, estradiol is [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] into the much less potent estrogen estrone. These reactions occur primarily in the [[liver]], but also in other [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The name ''estrogen'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶστρος}} ({{transliteration|grc|oîstros}}), literally meaning "verve" or "inspiration" but figuratively sexual passion or desire,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oistros&la=greek | title = Greek Word Study Tool: oistros|publisher = [[Perseus Project|Perseus Digital Library]] | access-date = 28 December 2011 }}</ref> and the suffix ''[[wikt:-gen|-gen]]'', meaning "producer of".

In addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than "placental extract" and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name "placental extract" with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.<ref name="FDA cosmetics"/>
