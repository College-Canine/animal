The '''choroid''', also known as the '''choroidea''' or '''choroid coat''', is a part of the [[uvea]], the [[Blood vessel|vascular]] layer of the [[eye]]. It contains [[connective tissue]]s, and lies between the [[retina]] and the [[sclera]].  The human choroid is thickest at the far extreme rear of the eye (at 0.2&nbsp;mm), while in the outlying areas it narrows to 0.1&nbsp;mm.<ref name="choroid">[http://www.mrcophth.com/MRCOphth/saqpart12004/SAQ2004answer6.html MRCOphth Sacs questions]</ref> The choroid provides [[oxygen]] and nourishment to the outer layers of the [[retina]].  Along with the [[ciliary body]] and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], the choroid forms the [[Uvea|uveal tract]].

The structure of the choroid is generally divided into four layers (classified in order of furthest away from the retina to closest):
*Haller's layer - outermost layer of the choroid consisting of larger diameter blood vessels;<ref name="choroid"/>
*[[Sattler's layer]] - layer of medium diameter blood vessels;<ref name="choroid"/>
*[[Capillary lamina of choroid|Choriocapillaris]] - layer of capillaries;<ref name="choroid"/> and
*[[Bruch's membrane]] (synonyms: Lamina basalis, Complexus basalis, Lamina vitra) - innermost layer of the choroid.<ref name="choroid"/>

== Blood supply ==
There are two circulations of the eye:  the retinal (in the retina) and [[uvea]]l, supplied in humans by [[Ciliary arteries|posterior ciliary arteries]], originating from the [[ophthalmic artery]] (a branch of the [[internal carotid artery]]).<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53329/ The Ocular Circulation]</ref>  The arteries of the [[uvea]]l circulation, supplying the [[uvea]] and outer and middle layers of the retina, are branches of the ophthalmic artery and enter the eyeball without passing with the optic nerve.  The retinal circulation, on the other hand, derives its circulation from the central retinal artery, also a branch of the ophthalmic artery, but passing in conjunction with the optic nerve.<ref name="eb">"Sensory Reception:  Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye" vol. 27, p. 174  Encyclopædia Britannica,  1987</ref>  They branch in a segmental distribution to end arterioles and not [[anastomoses]]. This is clinically significant for diseases affecting  choroidal blood supply. The [[macula]] responsible for central vision and  the anterior part of the [[optic nerve]] are dependent on choroidal blood supply.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bjo.59.11.631 | last1 = Hayreh | first1 = SS. |name-list-style=vanc |date=November 1975 | title = Segmental nature of the choroidal vasculature | journal = Br J Ophthalmol | volume = 59 | issue = 11| pages = 631–48 | pmid = 812547 | pmc = 1017426 }}</ref> The structure of choroidal vessels can be revealed by [[optical coherence tomography]], and blood flow can be revealed by [[Indocyanine green angiography]], and [[laser Doppler imaging]].<ref>Puyo, Léo, Michel Paques, Mathias Fink, José-Alain Sahel, and Michael Atlan.

===In bony fish===
[[Teleosts]] bear a body of capillary adjacent to the optic nerve called the choroidal gland. Though its function is not known, it is believed to be a supplemental oxygen carrier.<ref>"Eye (Vertebrate)" McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, vol. 6, 2007.</ref>

==Mechanism==
[[Melanin]], a dark colored pigment, helps the choroid limit uncontrolled reflection within the eye that would potentially result in the perception of confusing images.

In humans and most other [[primates]], melanin occurs throughout the choroid. In [[albino]] humans, frequently melanin is absent and [[low vision|vision is low]].  In many animals, however, the partial absence of melanin contributes to superior [[night vision]]. In these animals, melanin is absent from a section of the choroid and within that section a layer of highly reflective tissue, the [[tapetum lucidum]], helps to collect light by reflecting it in a controlled manner.  The uncontrolled reflection of light from dark choroid produces the photographic [[red-eye effect]] on photos, whereas the controlled reflection of light from the tapetum lucidum produces [[eyeshine]] (see [[Tapetum lucidum]]).

==History==
The choroid was first described by [[Democritus]] (c. 460 – c. 370 [[BCE]]) around 400 BCE, calling it the "chitoon
malista somphos" (more spongy tunic [than the [[sclera]]]).<ref name = Dolz-Marco2017>Dolz-Marco, R., Gallego-Pinazo, R., Dansingani, K. K., & Yannuzzi, L. A. (2017). The history of the choroid. In J. Chhablani & J. Ruiz-Medrano (Eds.), Choroidal Disorders (Vol. 1–5, pp. 1-5). Academic Press. https://doi.org/0.1016/b978-0-12-805313-3.00001-6</ref> Democritus likely saw the choroid from dissections of animal eyes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rudolph |first=Kelli |date= 2012|title=Democritus' Ophthalmology |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-quarterly/article/abs/democritus-ophthalmology/75F141868614774250E11F39DB7C5072 |journal=The Classical Quarterly |language=en |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=496–501 |doi=10.1017/S0009838812000109 |issn=0009-8388}}</ref>

About 100 years later, [[Herophilos]] (c. 335 – 280 BCE) also described the choroid from his dissections on eyes of [[cadaver]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Staden |first=Heinrich von |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGhlIfJZkVoC |title=Herophilus: The Art of Medicine in Early Alexandria: Edition, Translation and Essays |date=1989-04-20 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-23646-1 |language=en}}</ref><ref>Reverón, R.

==Clinical significance==
Choroid is the most common site for metastasis in the eye due to its extensive vascular supply. The origin of the metastases are usually from breast cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and kidney cancer. Bilateral choroidal metastases are usually due to breast cancer, while unilateral metastasis is due to lung cancer. Choroidal metastases should be differentiated from [[uveal melanoma]], where the latter is a primary tumour arising from the choroid itself.<ref name="pmid25827542">{{cite journal |vauthors=Arepalli S, Kaliki S, Shields CL |title=Choroidal metastases: origin, features, and therapy |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=122–7 |date=February 2015 |pmid=25827542 |pmc=4399120 |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.154380 |url= |doi-access=free }}</ref>
