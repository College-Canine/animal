The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|κόπρος}} {{transliteration|grc|kópros}} "feces" and {{lang|grc|φαγεῖν}} {{transliteration|grc|phageîn}} "to eat". Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Hirakawa H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}</ref>

[[Coprophilia]] is a [[paraphilia]] ([[DSM-5]]), where the object of sexual interest is feces, and may be associated with coprophagia.

[[Image:Adonis Blue butterflies.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Adonis blue]] [[Butterfly|butterflies]] feeding on a lump of feces]]
Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semidigested [[food]], particularly in the case of [[herbivore]]s, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' [[Digestion|digestive systems]]. Thousands of species of coprophagous insects are known, especially among the orders [[Fly|Diptera]] and [[Beetle|Coleoptera]]. Examples of such flies are ''[[Scathophaga stercoraria]]'' and ''[[Sepsis cynipsea]]'', dung flies commonly found in Europe around cattle droppings. 

Among beetles, [[dung beetle]]s are a diverse lineage, many of which feed on the microorganism-rich liquid component of mammals' dung, and lay their eggs in balls composed mainly of the remaining fibrous material.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2008.04.011  |title = Ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by Scarabaeine dung beetles|journal = Biological Conservation|volume = 141|issue = 6|pages = 1461–1474|year = 2008 | vauthors = Nichols E, Spector S, Louzada J, Larsen T, Amezquita S, Favila ME | bibcode=2008BCons.141.1461N | collaboration = The Scarabaeinae Research Network }}</ref> Group living and aggregation among [[Forficula auricularia|common earwig beetles]] promotes allo-coprophagy (consuming the feces of other members of one's own species) to promote the growth of helpful gut bacteria and provide a food source when food is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Körner |first=Maximilian |last2=Diehl |first2=Janina M.

Through proctodeal feeding, [[termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites,  a three-way symbiotic relationship exists; termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus ''Pseudotrichonympha'' in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noda S, Kitade O, Inoue T, Kawai M, Kanuka M, Hiroshima K, Hongoh Y, Constantino R, Uys V, Zhong J, Kudo T, Ohkuma M | title = Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists (Pseudotrichonympha spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial endosymbionts | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 1257–1266 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17391411 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03219.x | bibcode = 2007MolEc..16.1257N | s2cid = 21264858 }}</ref>

=== By vertebrates ===
[[Lagomorpha|Lagomorphs]] ([[Rabbit|rabbits]], [[Hare|hares]], [[Pika|pikas]]) and some other mammals ferment fiber in their cecums, which is then expelled as <em>[[cecotrope]]s</em> and eaten from the anus, a process called <em>[[cecotrope|cecotrophy]]</em>.  Then their food is processed through the gastrointestinal tract a second time, which allows them to absorb more nutrition.  While cecotropes are expelled from the anus, they are not feces and thus eating them is not called coprophagia.

Domesticated and wild mammals are sometimes coprophagic.

Some dogs may lack critical digestive enzymes when they are only eating processed dried foods, so they gain these from consuming fecal matter. They only consume fecal matter that is less than two days old which supports this theory.<ref>{{cite news|vauthors=Brogan J|title=Everyone Poops. Some Animals Eat It.

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]]. Concerns have arisen that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of cattle brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.
