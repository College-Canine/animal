The classic triad of visible blood in the urine ([[hematuria]]), flank pain and palpable abdominal mass occurs in less than 15% of the cases.  RCC may present with signs and symptoms caused by the substances the cancer cell produce (i.e. [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

[[Paraneoplastic syndrome]]s caused by kidney cancer can be broadly classified as endocrine and non-endocrine. Endocrine dysfunctions include increase in blood calcium levels ([[Hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]]), high blood pressure ([[hypertension]]), increased red bloods ([[polycythemia]]), liver dysfunction, milky nipple discharge unrelated normal breast-feeding ([[galactorrhea]]), and [[Cushing's syndrome]]. Non-endocrine dysfunctions include deposition of protein in tissue ([[amyloidosis]]), decrease in hemoglobin or red blood cells ([[anemia]]), disorders of nerves, muscles (neuromyopathies), blood vessels ([[vasculopathy]]) and blood clotting mechanisms ([[coagulopathy]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Palapattu|first1=Ganesh S.|last2=Kristo|first2=Blaine|last3=Rajfer|first3=Jacob|date=2002|title=Paraneoplastic syndromes in urologic malignancy: the many faces of renal cell carcinoma|journal=Reviews in Urology|volume=4|issue=4|pages=163–170|issn=1523-6161|pmc=1475999|pmid=16985675}}</ref>

==Causes==

About 25-30% of kidney cancer is attributed to smoking.<ref name=":1" /> Smokers have a 1.3 times higher risk of developing kidney cancer compared to non-smokers. Moreover, there is a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer development. Men who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day have twice the risk. Likewise, women who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day have 1.5 times the risk of non-smokers. After 10 years of smoking cessation a substantial reduction is seen in the risk of developing kidney cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Jay D.|last2=van der Hel|first2=Olga L.|last3=McMillan|first3=Garnett P.|last4=Boffetta|first4=Paolo|last5=Brennan|first5=Paul|date=2005-03-10|title=Renal cell carcinoma in relation to cigarette smoking: meta-analysis of 24 studies|journal=International Journal of Cancer|volume=114|issue=1|pages=101–108|doi=10.1002/ijc.20618|issn=0020-7136|pmid=15523697|s2cid=10136386|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Kidney masses can be classified by the nature of the cells in the growth, or by its appearance on radiography.<ref name=":07"/> The term cancer refers to a malignant tumor, which is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cancer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112221544/https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cancer|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2019|title=Cancer {{!}} Definition of Cancer by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> However, kidney masses can be due to growth of normal tissue (benign), inflammatory (a reaction of the immune system), or vascular (cells of the blood vessels).{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

=== Medical imaging ===
Since there is a large differential diagnosis for a kidney tumor, the first step is to characterize the mass with medical imaging to assess its likelihood of being benign or malignant. Ultrasonography is sometimes used to evaluate a suspected kidney mass, as it can characterize cystic and solid kidney masses without radiation exposure and at relative low cost.<ref name=":07" /> Radiologically tumors are grouped based on appearance into simple cystic, complex cystic, or solid.<ref name=":07" /> The most important differentiating feature of a cancerous and non-cancerous tumor on imaging is enhancement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Israel|first1=Gary M.|last2=Bosniak|first2=Morton A.|title=How I Do It: Evaluating Renal Masses|journal=Radiology|language=en|volume=236|issue=2|pages=441–450|doi=10.1148/radiol.2362040218|pmid=16040900|issn=0033-8419|year=2005|s2cid=1916092}}</ref> Simple cysts, which are defined by strict criteria<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Silverman|first1=Stuart G.|last2=Pedrosa|first2=Ivan|last3=Ellis|first3=James H.|last4=Hindman|first4=Nicole M.|last5=Schieda|first5=Nicola|last6=Smith|first6=Andrew D.|last7=Remer|first7=Erick M.|last8=Shinagare|first8=Atul B.|last9=Curci|first9=Nicole E.|last10=Raman|first10=Steven S.|last11=Wells|first11=Shane A.|date=2019-06-18|title=Bosniak Classification of Cystic Renal Masses, Version 2019: An Update Proposal and Needs Assessment|journal=Radiology|volume=292|issue=2|pages=475–488|doi=10.1148/radiol.2019182646|issn=0033-8419|pmc=6677285|pmid=31210616}}</ref> are safe to be monitored if the person does not have any symptoms.<ref name=":07" />  However, all masses that are not clearly simple cysts should be further evaluated and confirmed by alternate imaging techniques.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/guidelines/renal-cancer-renal-mass-and-localized-renal-cancer-guideline#x7068|title=Renal Cancer: Renal Mass & Localized Renal Cancer Guideline - American Urological Association|website=www.auanet.org|access-date=2019-10-29|archive-date=2020-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215171032/https://www.auanet.org/guidelines/renal-cancer-renal-mass-and-localized-renal-cancer-guideline#x7068|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":07" />

=== Laboratory studies ===
People with suspected kidney cancer should also have their kidney function evaluated to help determine treatment options. Blood tests to determine kidney function include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), a complete blood count (CBC).<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last1=Motzer|first1=Robert J.|last2=Jonasch|first2=Eric|last3=Agarwal|first3=Neeraj|last4=Bhayani|first4=Sam|last5=Bro|first5=William P.|last6=Chang|first6=Sam S.|last7=Choueiri|first7=Toni K.|last8=Costello|first8=Brian A.|last9=Derweesh|first9=Ithaar H.|last10=Fishman|first10=Mayer|last11=Gallagher|first11=Thomas H.|date=2017-06-01|title=Kidney Cancer, Version 2.2017, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology|url=https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/15/6/article-p804.xml|journal=Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network|volume=15|issue=6|pages=804–834|doi=10.6004/jnccn.2017.0100|pmid=28596261|issn=1540-1405|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":15"/> In addition, these tests help understand the overall health of the person, which can be affected by metastatic disease (disease that is outside of the kidney). For example, liver or bone involvement could result in abnormal liver enzymes, electrolyte abnormalities, or anemia. A urine sample should also be collected for urinalysis.<ref name=":15"/><ref name=":07"/>

=== Biopsy ===
The utility of renal mass biopsy (RMB) lies in that it can confirm malignancy with reliability, can direct therapy based on diagnosis, and can provide drainage.<ref name=":15"/>

Once imaging has been completed, renal mass biopsy should be considered if there is a high likelihood that the mass is hematologic, metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious.<ref name=":15"/> These types of lesions would not be managed surgically, differing from cancer originating from the kidney. Cancer originating outside the kidney and lymphoma are managed systemically.<ref name=":07"/><ref name=":15"/>

RMB can accurately diagnose malignancy, however, it cannot reliably diagnose benign disease. In other words, if the biopsy shows cancer, there is a 99.8% chance that kidney cancer is present (Positive Predictive Value= 99.8%). A negative biopsy does not rule out a diagnosis of cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=Hiten D.|last2=Johnson|first2=Michael H.|last3=Pierorazio|first3=Phillip M.|last4=Sozio|first4=Stephen M.|last5=Sharma|first5=Ritu|last6=Iyoha|first6=Emmanuel|last7=Bass|first7=Eric B.|last8=Allaf|first8=Mohamad E.|date=May 2016|title=Diagnostic Accuracy and Risks of Biopsy in the Diagnosis of a Renal Mass Suspicious for Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma: Systematic Review of the Literature|journal=The Journal of Urology|volume=195|issue=5|pages=1340–1347|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2015.11.029|issn=1527-3792|pmc=5609078|pmid=26901507}}</ref>

===Staging===
Staging is the process that helps determine the extent and spread of the disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/staging.html|title=Kidney Cancer Stages {{!}} Renal Cell Carcinoma Staging|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Renal cell carcinoma is the only type of kidney cancer that can be staged. The first step of staging follows the [[TNM staging system]] proposed by the Union International Contre le Cancer that is widely used among cancers in other organs.<ref name=":07"/> The TNM staging system classifies the primary tumor (T), lymph nodes (N) and distant metastasis (M) of the disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) published a Cancer Staging Manual revision in 2010 that describes the values of TMN for renal cell carcinoma.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=AJCC cancer staging manual.|date=2010|publisher=Springer|others=Edge, Stephen B., American Joint Committee on Cancer.|isbn=9780387884400|edition=7th|location=New York|oclc=316431417}}</ref><ref name=":07" />

Lymph node involvement is classified as either regional lymph node metastasis (N1), or no involvement (N0).<ref name=":3" /> Similarly, M1 describes distant metastasis, while M0 describes no distant metastasis.<ref name=":3" />

The primary tumor of renal cell carcinoma is categorized in the table below, as according to the AJCC 8th Edition Cancer Staging Manual:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/staging.html|title=Kidney Cancer Stages|website=cancer.org}} Last Revised: February 1, 2020</ref><ref name="SwamiNussenzveig2019">{{cite journal|last1=Swami|first1=Umang|last2=Nussenzveig|first2=Roberto H. |last3=Haaland|first3=Benjamin |last4=Agarwal|first4=Neeraj |title=Revisiting AJCC TNM staging for renal cell carcinoma: quest for improvement|journal=Annals of Translational Medicine|volume=7|issue=S1|year=2019|pages=S18|issn=2305-5839|doi=10.21037/atm.2019.01.50|pmid=31032299|pmc=6462602|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment for kidney cancer depends on the type and stage of the disease. Surgery is the most common treatment as kidney cancer does not often respond to [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]]. Surgical complexity can be estimated by the [[RENAL Nephrometry Scoring System]]. If the cancer has not spread it will usually be removed by surgery. In some cases this involves [[Nephrectomy|removing the whole kidney]] however most tumors are amenable to [[Nephrectomy|partial removal]] to eradicate the tumor and preserve the remaining normal portion of the kidney. Surgery is not always possible – for example, the patient may have other medical conditions that prevent it, or the cancer may have spread around the body and doctors may not be able to remove it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/treatment/types/early-stage-kidney-cancer#surgery|title=Early stage and locally advanced kidney cancer treatment|date=2017-08-30}}</ref> If the cancer cannot be treated with surgery other techniques such as [[Cryotherapy|freezing the tumour]] or [[Radiofrequency ablation|treating it with high temperatures]] may be used. However, these are not yet used as standard treatments for kidney cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/type/kidney-cancer/treatment/types/advanced-kidney-cancer#other|title=Advanced kidney cancer|date=2017-08-30}}</ref> Recently, evidence stemming from the KEYNOTE-564 study has shed light on the potential use of systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting, with promising results. Patients exhibiting specific clear cell RCC tumor characteristics and having undergone treatment with Pembrolizumab for 17 cycles (around 1 year) had significant improvement in disease-free survival. However, the study has yet to yield conclusive findings in relation to overall survival. <ref>{{cite journal|title=Adjuvant Pembrolizumab after Nephrectomy in Renal-Cell Carcinoma|date=2021-08-19|doi=10.1056/nejmoa2106391 |last1=Choueiri |first1=Toni K. |last2=Tomczak |first2=Piotr |last3=Park |first3=Se Hoon |last4=Venugopal |first4=Balaji |last5=Ferguson |first5=Thomas |last6=Chang |first6=Yen-Hwa |last7=Hajek |first7=Jaroslav |last8=Symeonides |first8=Stefan N. |last9=Lee |first9=Jae Lyun |last10=Sarwar |first10=Naveed |last11=Thiery-Vuillemin |first11=Antoine |last12=Gross-Goupil |first12=Marine |last13=Mahave |first13=Mauricio |last14=Haas |first14=Naomi B. |last15=Sawrycki |first15=Piotr |last16=Gurney |first16=Howard |last17=Chevreau |first17=Christine |last18=Melichar |first18=Bohuslav |last19=Kopyltsov |first19=Evgeniy |last20=Alva |first20=Ajjai |last21=Burke |first21=John M. |last22=Doshi |first22=Gurjyot |last23=Topart |first23=Delphine |last24=Oudard |first24=Stephane |last25=Hammers |first25=Hans |last26=Kitamura |first26=Hiroshi |last27=Bedke |first27=Jens |last28=Perini |first28=Rodolfo F. |last29=Zhang |first29=Pingye |last30=Imai |first30=Kentaro |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=385 |issue=8 |pages=683–694 |pmid=34407342 |s2cid=237215136 |display-authors=1 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In [[Wilms' tumor]], chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the accepted treatments, depending on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed.<ref name="wilms-tumour">{{cite web|url=http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/wilms-tumour|title=Wilms' tumour (kidney cancer in children)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406063913/http://cancerhelp.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-questions/wilms-tumour|archive-date=2012-04-06|date=2017-08-30}}</ref>

===Children===
The majority of kidney cancers reported in children are Wilms' tumors. These tumors can begin to grow when a fetus is still developing in the uterus, and may not cause problems until the child is a few years old. [[Wilms' tumor]] is most common in children under the age of 5, but can rarely be diagnosed in older children or in adults. It is still not clear what causes most Wilms' tumors. The most common symptoms are swelling of the abdomen and blood in the urine.<ref name=wilms-tumour />

==Epidemiology==
Around 208,500 new cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed in the world each year, accounting for just under 2% of all cancers.<ref>Lindblad, P. and Adami H.O, Kidney Cancer, in Textbook of Cancer.</ref> The highest rates are recorded in North America and the lowest rates in Asia and Africa.<ref>GLOBOCAN 2002, Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide 2002 estimates. 2006.</ref>

'''<big>Lifestyle risk factors</big>'''

Certain lifestyle factors have been associated with the development of renal cancer, although not all of them can be considered definitive causes. These include [[smoking]], [[Carcinogen|chemical carcinogens]], [[radiation]], [[virus]]es, diet and [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[diuretic]]s,<ref name=":14"/> and [[Alcohol and cancer|alcohol consumption]].<ref name=":05"/> Only a small percentage of kidney cancer cases have been linked to genetic factors.<ref name=":05"/> With obesity listed as one of the risk factors, daily physical activity and engaging in a healthy diet is proven to lower the rates of developing kidney cancer in the future.<ref name=":14"/>

'''<big>Age</big>'''

The incidence rate of renal cancer increases with the age of an individual, with 75 being the approximate age of the peak incidence rate, as of 2018.<ref name=":05"/> However, nearly one half of all cases are diagnosed before the age of 65.<ref name=":05"/> In both male and female children, renal tumors represent 2% to 6% of kidney cancer, with [[Wilms' tumor]]<ref name=":14"/> being the most common.

'''<big>Sex</big>'''

The incidence of kidney cancer is two times greater in men than in women, and this is thought to be due to biological differences. Mortality rates typically decrease more rapidly in women compared to men.<ref name=":05"/>

'''<big>International variations</big>'''

Incidence rates of kidney cancer can vary throughout the world. As of 2018, Czech Republic and Lithuania have the highest incidence rate of kidney cancer worldwide, with an age-standardized rate of 21.9/100,000 in males (Czech Republic) and 18.7/100,000 in males (Lithuania.) China, Thailand, and African countries (low-risk countries) have an incidence rate that is less than 2/100,000.<ref name=":05"/>

Since the early 2000s, Austria and Poland have been the only countries to report a decrease in kidney cancer rates.<ref name=":05"/>

Diagnosis access bias plays a large role in the epidemiology of kidney cancer. Differences in kidney cancer diagnosis across regions are likely due to differences in healthcare access, rather than a population's biological factors. Discrepancies in kidney cancer diagnosis has most likely led to the underrepresentation of mortality and incidence in low income countries.   

'''<big>Race</big>'''

Race and ethnicity may be a factor in the distribution of kidney cancer around the United States. There are higher incidence rates in Black men and Hispanics, an average rate for American Indians, and low rates in Asians in the United States. Black people with kidney cancer have lower mortality rates than Caucasians in the United States.<ref name=":05"/>

'''<big>Screening</big>'''

Accessibility for cancer screening is not very common due to high expenses. Improving cancer registries can improve care to those who have kidney cancer as well as decreasing the incidence and death rates. Safe and dependable treatment is key with the screening and treatment, which is not always the case in many developing nations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Klaassen|first1=Zachary|last2=Sayyid|first2=Rashid K.|last3=Wallis|first3=Christopher J.D.|date=2019|title=Lessons Learned from the Global Epidemiology of Kidney Cancer: A Refresher in Epidemiology 101|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302283818307231|journal=European Urology|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=85–87|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2018.09.035|pmid=30274700|s2cid=52900491}}</ref>

===United States===
The United States' [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] estimates for 2013 around 64,770 new cases of kidney cancer and 13,570 deaths from the disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cancer of the Kidney and Renal Pelvis – SEER Stat Fact Sheets|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/kidrp.html|publisher=National Cancer Institute, U.S. National Institutes of Health|access-date=2013-02-07}}</ref>

The incidence of kidney cancer is also increasing in the United States. This is thought to be a real increase, not only due to changes in the way the disease is diagnosed.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution=Chapter 24: Cancers of the Kidney and Renal Pelvic|first1=Charles F.|last1=Lynch|first2=Michele M.|last2=West|first3=Jessica A.|last3=Davila|first4=Charles E.|last4=Platz|pages=193–202|publisher=National Cancer Institute|title=SEER Survival Monograph: Cancer Survival Among Adults: US SEER Program, 1988–2001, Patient and Tumor Characteristics|editor1-last=Ries|editor1-first=LAG|editor2-last=Young|editor2-first=JL|editor3-last=Keel|editor3-first=GE|editor4-last=Eisner|editor4-first=MP|volume=NIH Pub.
