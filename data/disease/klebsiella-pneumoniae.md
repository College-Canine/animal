'''''Klebsiella pneumoniae''''' is a [[Gram-negative]], non-motile, [[Bacterial capsule|encapsulated]], [[lactose]]-[[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermenting]], [[facultative anaerobic]], rod-shaped [[bacterium]]. It appears as a mucoid lactose fermenter on [[MacConkey agar]].

Although found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines,<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = [[McGraw Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}</ref> it can cause destructive changes to human and animal lungs if aspirated, specifically to the alveoli resulting in bloody, brownish or yellow colored jelly-like [[sputum]]. In the clinical setting, it is the most significant member of the [[genus]] ''[[Klebsiella]]'' of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. ''K. oxytoca'' and ''K. rhinoscleromatis'' have also been demonstrated in human clinical specimens. In recent years, ''Klebsiella'' species have become important pathogens in [[nosocomial]] infections.

It naturally occurs in the soil, and about 30% of strains can [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in anaerobic conditions.<ref name=Postgate_1998>{{cite book| vauthors = Postgate J |year=1998|title=Nitrogen Fixation |edition= 3rd|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-64047-3}}</ref> As a free-living [[diazotroph]], its nitrogen-fixation system has been much-studied, and is of agricultural interest, as ''K. pneumoniae'' has been demonstrated to increase crop yields in agricultural conditions.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Riggs PJ, Chelius MK, Iniguez AL, Kaeppler SM, Triplett EW |title=Enhanced maize productivity by inoculation with diazotrophic bacteria|journal=Australian Journal of Plant Physiology|date=2001|volume=29|issue=8|pages=829–836|doi=10.1071/PP01045}}</ref>

It is closely related to ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca|K. oxytoca]]'' from which it is distinguished by being [[indole test|indole]]-negative and by its ability to grow on [[melezitose]] but not [[3-hydroxybutyrate]].

==History==
The genus ''Klebsiella'' was named after the German microbiologist  [[Edwin Klebs]] (1834–1913).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It is also known as Friedlander's bacillum in honor of [[Carl Friedländer]], a German pathologist, who proposed that this bacterium was the etiological factor for the pneumonia seen especially in immunocompromised individuals such as people with chronic diseases or alcoholics.

Community-acquired pneumonia caused by ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' may occasionally be called ''Friedländer's pneumonia''.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Zander DS, Farver CF | title = Pulmonary Pathology: A Volume in Foundations in Diagnostic Pathology Series | date = 2016 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-323-46119-1 | page = 169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ze_DQAAQBAJ&q=Community-acquired+pneumonia+caused+by+Klebsiella+pneumoniae+may+be+called+Friedl%C3%A4nder%27s+Pneumonia&pg=PA169|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Illness most commonly affects middle-aged and older men more often than women with debilitating diseases. This patient population is believed to have impaired respiratory host defenses, including persons with [[diabetes]], [[alcoholism]], [[malignancy]], liver disease, [[COPD|chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases]], [[glucocorticoid]] therapy, [[kidney failure]], and certain occupational exposures (such as papermill workers). Many of these infections are obtained when a person is in the hospital for some other reason (a [[nosocomial infection]]).

In addition to pneumonia, ''Klebsiella'' can also cause infections in the [[urinary]] tract, lower [[biliary]] tract, and surgical wound sites. The range of clinical diseases includes pneumonia, [[thrombophlebitis]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[cholecystitis]], [[diarrhea]], upper [[respiratory]] tract infection, wound infection, [[osteomyelitis]], [[meningitis]], and bacteremia, and [[sepsis]]. For patients with an invasive device in their bodies, contamination of the device becomes a risk; neonatal ward devices, respiratory support equipment, and urinary catheters put patients at increased risk. Also, the use of antibiotics can be a factor that increases the risk of nosocomial infection with ''Klebsiella'' bacteria. [[Sepsis]] and septic shock can follow entry of the bacteria into the blood.

Research conducted at King's College, London has implicated [[molecular mimicry]] between [[HLA-B27]] and two ''Klebsiella'' surface molecules as the cause of [[ankylosing spondylitis]].<ref name=Rashid_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rashid T, Ebringer A | title = Ankylosing spondylitis is linked to Klebsiella--the evidence | journal = Clinical Rheumatology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 858–864 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17186116 | doi = 10.1007/s10067-006-0488-7 | s2cid = 43456525 }}</ref>

===''Klebsiella'' pneumonia===

The most common condition caused by ''Klebsiella'' bacteria outside the hospital is [[pneumonia]], typically in the form of [[bronchopneumonia]] and also [[bronchitis]]. These patients have an increased tendency to develop lung [[abscess]]es, cavitation, [[empyema]], and [[Adhesion (medicine)|pleural adhesions]]. It has a death rate around 50%, even with [[antimicrobial]] therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Setiawan A, Widodo AD, Endraswari PD | title = Comparison of ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and doxycycline on ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'': Time-kill curve analysis | journal = Annals of Medicine and Surgery | volume = 84 | pages = 104841 | date = December 2022 | pmid = 36536710 | pmc = 9758284 | doi = 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104841 }}</ref>

====Pathophysiology====
It is typically due to [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] and alcoholism may be a risk factor, though it is also commonly implicated in [[hospital]]-acquired urinary tract [[infection]]s, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) individuals.<ref name=pat/><ref name=uk/> In terms of the pathophysiology of ''Klebsiella'' pneumonia the [[neutrophil]] [[myeloperoxidase]] defense against ''K. pneumoniae'' is often seen. Oxidative inactivation of [[elastase]] is involved, while [[Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein|LBP]] helps transfer bacteria cell wall elements to the cells.<ref name="emed">{{EMedicine|article|219907|Klebsiella Infections}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li B, Zhao Y, Liu C, Chen Z, Zhou D | title = Molecular pathogenesis of Klebsiella pneumoniae | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 1071–1081 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25340836 | doi = 10.2217/fmb.14.48 }}</ref>

====Signs and symptoms====
Individuals with ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' tend to cough up a characteristic [[sputum]], as well as having fever, [[nausea]], [[tachycardia]], and [[vomiting]]. ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' tends to affect people with underlying conditions, such as [[alcoholism]].<ref name="pat">{{cite web | title = Aspiration Pneumonia Symptoms.

====Treatment====
Treatment for ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' is by [[antibiotic]]s such as [[aminoglycoside]]s, [[pipercillin tazobactam]], and [[cephalosporin]]s, the choice depending upon [[antibiotic susceptibility testing]], the person's health condition, medical history and severity of the disease.<ref name="uk">{{cite web | title = Klebsiella species – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/klebsiella-species#treatment|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="bk">{{cite book | vauthors = Wilson WC, Grande CM, Hoyt DB | title = Trauma critical care | date = 2007 | publisher = Informa Healthcare | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-4200-1684-0 | page = 444 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3H3AIEtvc8YC&q=klebsiella+pneumoniae+treatment&pg=PA444 | access-date = 13 January 2017 }}</ref>

===Hypervirulent ''Klebsiella pneumonia''===
Hypervirulent (hvKp) is a rather recent ''K pneumoniae'' variant that is significantly more virulent than classical ''K. pneumoniae'' (cKp). While cKp is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections that usually affect immunocompromised patients, hvKp is clinically more concerning since it also causes disease in healthy individuals and can infect virtually every site of the body. The genetic traits that lead to this pathotype are included in a large virulence plasmid and potentially on additional conjugative elements.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Russo TA, Marr CM | title = Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31092506 | pmc = 6589860 | doi = 10.1128/cmr.00001-19 }}</ref>

==Transmission==
To get a ''K. pneumoniae'' infection, a person must be exposed to the [[bacteria]]. In other words, ''K. pneumoniae'' must enter the [[respiratory]] tract to cause pneumonia, or the blood to cause a bloodstream infection.
In healthcare settings, ''K. pneumoniae'' bacteria can be spread through person-to-person contact (for example, contaminated hands of healthcare personnel, or other people via patient to patient) or, less commonly, by contamination of the environment; the role of transmission directly from the environment to patients is [[controversial]] and requires further investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/cre-clinicianfaq.html|title=Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Infection: Clinician FAQs |website=Cdc.gov|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref> However, the bacteria are not spread through the air.
Patients in healthcare settings also may be exposed to ''K. pneumoniae'' when they are on [[ventilators]], or have [[intravenous]] [[catheters]] or wounds. These medical tools and conditions may allow ''K. pneumoniae'' to enter the body and cause infection.<ref name="CDC Guideline"/>

It is now the most common CRE species encountered within the United States.

CRKP is resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have caused high rates of morbidity and mortality, in particular among persons with prolonged hospitalization and those critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (e.g., ventilators or central venous catheters). The concern is that carbapenem is often used as a drug of last resort when battling resistant bacterial strains. New slight mutations could result in infections for which healthcare professionals can do very little, if anything, to treat patients with resistant organisms.

A number of mechanisms cause carbapenem resistance in the Enterobacteriaceae. These include hyperproduction of ampC [[beta-lactamase]] with an outer membrane porin mutation,  CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with a porin mutation or drug efflux, and carbapenemase production. The most important mechanism of resistance by CRKP is the production of a carbapenemase enzyme, ''blak''pc. The gene that encodes the ''blak''pc enzyme is carried on a mobile piece of genetic material (a [[transposon]]; the specific transposon involved is called Tn4401), which increases the risk for dissemination. CRE can be difficult to detect because some strains that harbor ''blak''pc have [[minimum inhibitory concentration]]s <!-- (MICs) --> that are elevated, but still within the susceptible range for carbapenems. Because these strains are susceptible to carbapenems, they are not identified as potential clinical or infection control risks using standard susceptibility testing guidelines. Patients with unrecognized CRKP colonization have been reservoirs for transmission during nosocomial outbreaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca|title=Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) – Agence de la sante publique du Canada (ASPC)|website=Phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=25 October 2017|date=2004-09-24}}</ref>

=== Local outbreaks ===
'''Israel 2007-2008'''. A nationwide outbreak of CRE in Israel peaked in March, 2007 at 55.5 cases per 100,000 patient days and necessitated a nationwide treatment plan. The intervention entailed physical separation of all CRE carriers and appointment of a task force to oversee efficacy of isolation by closely monitoring hospitals and intervening when necessary. After the treatment plan (measured in May, 2008), the number of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased to 11.7. The plan was effective because of strict hospital compliance, wherein each was required to keep detailed documentation of all CRE carriers. In fact, for each increase in compliance by 10%, incidence of cases per 100,000 patient days decreased by 0.6. Therefore, containment on a nationwide scale requires nationwide intervention.<ref name="Jenniferiscool">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwaber MJ, Lev B, Israeli A, Solter E, Smollan G, Rubinovitch B, Shalit I, Carmeli Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Containment of a country-wide outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Israeli hospitals via a nationally implemented intervention | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 52 | issue = 7 | pages = 848–855 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21317398 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cir025 | doi-access = free }}

'''Nevada 2016'''. In mid-August 2016, a resident of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] was hospitalized in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] due to a CRE (specifically ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'') infection. In early September of the same year, she developed septic shock and died. On testing by CDC an isolate from the patient was found to be resistant to all 26 antibiotics available in the US, including drug of last resort [[colistin]].<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Gallagher J |title=Bug resistant to all antibiotics kills woman|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38609553|access-date=16 January 2017|work=BBC News|date=13 January 2017}}</ref> It is believed she may have picked up the microbe while hospitalized in India for two years due to a broken right femur and subsequent femur and hip infections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nevada woman dies of superbug resistant to all available US antibiotics|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/12/nevada-woman-superbug-resistant/|access-date=13 January 2017|work=STAT|date=12 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Belluz J |title=A woman died from a superbug that outsmarted all 26 US antibiotics|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/13/14265620/woman-died-superbug-antibiotics|access-date=13 January 2017|work=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Superbug Killed Nevada Woman|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/superbug-killed-nevada-woman-022715225.html|access-date=13 January 2017|work=Yahoo!

== Antimicrobial resistance gene transfer ==
''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' carries a large number of anti-microbial resistance genes (AMR genes).  These genes are transferred via plasmids from and to other human pathogens. One human pathogen that commonly acquires AMR genes from ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' is ''[[Salmonella]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} This could help with treatment of salmonella infections due to having knowledge of possible antibiotic resistance data.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The majority of AMR genes in ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' are plasmid-borne. An example of a niche would be soil, often considered a hotspot for gene transfer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

==Prevention==
To prevent spreading'' Klebsiella'' infections between patients, healthcare personnel must follow specific infection-control precautions,<ref name="CDC Guideline">{{cite web|title=Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007|date=19 February 2021|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/klebsiella/klebsiella.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> which may include strict adherence to hand hygiene (preferably using an alcohol based hand rub (60–90%) or soap and water if hands are visibly soiled. Alcohol based hand rubs are effective against these Gram-negative bacilli)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/nois-sinp/guide/ipcm-mpci/pdf/guide-eng.pdf|title=Guidance : Infection Prevention and Control Measures for Healthcare Workers in All Healthcare Settings|website=Phac-aspc.gc.ca|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref> and wearing gowns and gloves when they enter rooms where patients with ''Klebsiella''–related illnesses are housed. Healthcare facilities also must follow strict cleaning procedures to prevent the spread of ''Klebsiella''.<ref name="CDC Guideline"/>

To prevent the spread of infections, patients also should clean their hands very often, including:
* Before preparing or eating food
* Before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth
* Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages
* After using the restroom
* After blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing
* After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls, or the phone<ref name="CDC Guideline"/>

==Treatment==
''K. pneumoniae'' can be treated with antibiotics if the infections are not [[drug-resistant]]. Infections by ''K. pneumoniae'' can be difficult to treat because fewer antibiotics are effective against them. In such cases, a microbiology laboratory must run tests to determine which antibiotics will treat the infection.<ref name="CDC Guideline"/> More specific treatments of ''Klebsiella'' pneumonia are given in its section above. For [[urinary tract infection]]s with multidrug-resistant ''Klebsiella'' species, a combination therapy with [[amikacin]] and [[meropenem]] has been suggested.<ref name="YasinAssad2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yasin F, Assad S, Talpur AS, Zahid M, Malik SA | title = Combination Therapy for Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae Urinary Tract Infection | journal = Cureus | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = e1503 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28948123 | pmc = 5608481 | doi = 10.7759/cureus.1503 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Research==
Multiple drug-resistant ''K. pneumoniae'' strains have been killed ''in vivo'' by intraperitoneal, intravenous, or intranasal administration of [[phage therapy|phages]] in laboratory tests.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogovazova GG, Voroshilova NN, Bondarenko VM | title = [The efficacy of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteriophage in the therapy of experimental Klebsiella infection] | language = ru | journal = Zhurnal Mikrobiologii, Epidemiologii I Immunobiologii | issue = 4 | pages = 5–8 | date = April 1991 | pmid = 1882608 }}</ref> Resistance to phages is not likely to be as troublesome as to antibiotics as new infectious phages are likely to be available in environmental reservoirs. Phage therapy can be used in conjunction with antibiotics, to supplement their activity instead of replacing it altogether.<ref>{{cite book |title= A Literature Review of the Practical Application of Bacteriophage Research | veditors = Chanishvili N |year= 2012 |publisher= [[Nova Publishers|Nova Science]] |location= Hauppauge, NY |isbn= 978-1-62100-851-4}}</ref>

==Vaccine development==
New data sources outlining the global burden of ''K. pneumoniae'' and drug-resistant forms are expected to build momentum into prophylactic vaccine development.<ref>Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance, University of Washington. 2022. Accessed: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/microbe/?settings=eyIxIjoiYW1yIiwiMiI6ImJhciIsIjMiOiJhbXIiLCI0IjoyMiwiNSI6MSwiNiI6MSwiNyI6MSwiOCI6MSwiOSI6MSwiMTIiOjEsIjEzIjoxLCIxNCI6MSwiMTUiOjEsIjE2IjoyLCIxNyI6MywiMTgiOjIwMTksIjE5IjpmYWxzZSwiMjAiOnRydWUsIjIyIjoxfQ==</ref> The recent 2022 IHME study showed that in 2019 ''K. pneumoniae'' was responsible for 790,000 deaths [571,000–1,060,000] in all age groups across 11 infectious syndromes. Importantly, in Sub-saharan Africa ''K. pneumoniae'' was responsible for 124,000 [89,000–167,000] neonatal deaths due to bloodstream infections. Based on these and other data, a newly developed prophylactic vaccine would ideally be designed to prevent invasive ''K. pneumoniae'' disease in both vulnerable persons but also as a maternal vaccine to prevent neonatal sepsis and global demand assessments have been published.<ref>VacZine Analytics. MarketVIEW: Klebsiella pneumoniae vaccines. https://www.vaczine-analytics.com/products-marketviewVAMV087_klebsiella_pneumoniae_vaccines.asp</ref> As of June 2023, one single clinical development program for a ''K. pneumoniae'' vaccine [Kleb4V/GSK4429016A] was in a Phase 1/2 study in healthy adults aged 18–70 yrs (n=166) [Clinical trials identifier: NCT04959344]. The vaccine is an O-antigen based conjugate where the specific O-antigens in the vaccine remain undisclosed [Michael Kowarik, LimmaTech Biologics, World Vaccine Congress EU, 2022] although only a limited number of O-serotypes can account for a high proportion of clinical isolates.<ref>Trautmann M et al. O antigen seroepidemiology of Klebsiella clinical isolates and implications for immunoprophylaxis of Klebsiella infections. Vaccine. 22(7), 818–21 (2004)</ref> A recent Q1 2024 GSK Corporate R&D pipeline update showed that Kleb4V/GSK4429016A had been removed. The status of the program is now subject to verification.
