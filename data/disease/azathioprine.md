==Adverse effects==
[[File:000040lg Azathioprine 50 MG Oral Tablet.jpg|thumb|260px|Two generic azathioprine oral tablets, 50 mg each]]
Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects, especially at the beginning of a treatment. Such cases are met with taking azathioprine after meals or transient [[intravenous]] administration. Side effects that are probably [[hypersensitivity]] reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[rashes]]. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug, but rarely occurs under other indications. Because azathioprine [[bone marrow suppression|suppresses the bone marrow]], patients can develop [[anaemia]] and be more susceptible to [[infection]]; regular monitoring of the [[blood count]] is recommended during treatment.<ref name="ahf" /><ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|pages=4103–9|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=de}}</ref> [[Acute pancreatitis]] can also occur, especially in patients with Crohn's disease.<ref name="APT2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weersma RK, Peters FT, Oostenbrug LE, van den Berg AP, van Haastert M, Ploeg RJ, Posthumus MD, Homan van der Heide JJ, Jansen PL, van Dullemen HM | title = Increased incidence of azathioprine-induced pancreatitis in Crohn's disease compared with other diseases | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 843–850 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15479355 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.02197.x | s2cid = 21873238 }}</ref> Treatment is discontinued in up to 30% of patients due these effects but therapeutic drug monitoring of the biologically active metabolites, ''i.e.'' thiopurine nucleotides can help to optimize the efficacy and safety.

===Cancers===
Azathioprine is listed as a human [[carcinogen]] in the 12th Report on Carcinogens by the [[National Toxicology Program]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], asserting that it is "known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans."<ref name="roc2011">{{cite web|author=National Toxicology Program|author-link=National Toxicology Program|title=Report On Carcinogens – Twelfth Edition – 2011|date=10 June 2011|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12|publisher=[[National Toxicology Program]]|access-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716214414/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/roc12.pdf|archive-date=16 July 2012}}</ref> Since August 2009, the U.S. FDA has required warnings to be placed on packaging with respect to increased risks of certain cancers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm175803.htm |title=FDA: Cancer Warnings Required for TNF Blockers |date=August 4, 2009 |publisher=FDA |access-date=June 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703083928/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm175803.htm |archive-date=July 3, 2012 }}</ref>

The risks involved seem to be related both to the duration and the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]] may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine.

The various diseases requiring transplantation may in themselves increase the risks of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s of the skin, [[Cholangiocarcinoma|hepatobiliary carcinomas]], and [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tumours]] to which azathioprine may add additional risks.

====Skin cancers====
In transplant patients, [[skin cancer]] is 50 to 250 times more common than in the general population, and between 60 and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including azathioprine in organ transplantation has been linked to increased rates of developing skin cancer.<ref name="bbcsb">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4248356.stm |title=Skin cancer alert for organ drug |date=September 15, 2005 |website=[[BBC Online]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=June 10, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014205054/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4248356.stm |archive-date=October 14, 2012 }}</ref> Azathioprine causes the accumulation of [[6-thioguanine]] (6-TG) in patients' DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to [[ultraviolet light]].

==Overdose==
Large single doses are generally well tolerated; a patient who took 7.5&nbsp;g azathioprine (150 tablets) at once showed no relevant symptoms apart from vomiting, slightly decreased white blood cell count, and marginal changes in liver function parameters. Main symptoms of long-term overdosing are infections of unclear origin, [[mouth ulcer]]s, and spontaneous bleeding, all of which are consequences of its bone-marrow suppression.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

Azathioprine is absorbed from the gut to about 88%. [[Bioavailability]] varies greatly between individual patients, between 30 and 90%, because the drug is partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself, but also its metabolites, are reached after 1–2 hours, and the average plasma half-life is 26 to 80 minutes for azathioprine and 3–5 hours for drug plus metabolites. 20 to 30% are bound to [[plasma proteins]] while circulating in the bloodstream.<ref name="derma" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|year=2011|edition=25th|volume=2|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=de}}</ref><ref name="Steinhilber">{{cite book|title=Medizinische Chemie| vauthors = Steinhilber D, Schubert-Zsilavecz M, Roth HJ |publisher=Deutscher Apotheker Verlag|location=Stuttgart|year=2005|page=340|isbn=978-3-7692-3483-1|language=de}}</ref>

Azathioprine is a [[prodrug]], a substance that is not an active drug itself, but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first, it is slowly and almost completely converted to [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) by [[redox|reductive]] cleavage of the [[thioether]] (–[[sulfur|S]]–). This is mediated by [[glutathione]] and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver, and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thio[[guanosine triphosphate]] (TGTP) and thio[[deoxyguanosine triphosphate]] (TdGTP) via [[thioinosine monophosphate]] (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is [[methyl]]ated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are [[thiouric acid]] (38%) and various methylated and [[hydroxyl]]ated purines, which are excreted via the urine.<ref name="Mutschler" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Steinhilber" />

===Mechanism of action===
Azathioprine inhibits [[Purine metabolism#Biosynthesis|purine synthesis]]. Purines are needed to produce DNA and RNA. By inhibiting purine synthesis, less DNA and RNA are produced for the synthesis of [[white blood cell]]s, thus causing immunosuppression.

{{Technical|section|date=December 2014}}
Azathioprine is converted within tissues to 6-MP, some of which is converted, in turn, to [[6-thioguanine]] by the addition of an amino group. Both 6-MP and 6-thioguanine are conjugated with [[ribose]], and then phosphorylated to form the [[nucleotides]] [[thioinosinic acid]] and thioguanylic acid, respectively.<ref name="pmid12891528" /> These nucleotides masquerade, respectively, as [[inosinic acid]] and [[guanylic acid]]; the former is the starting point for purine nucleotide biosynthesis, while the latter is one of the building blocks of DNA and RNA.

==Chemistry==
Azathioprine is a [[thiopurine]] linked to a second [[heterocycle]] (an [[imidazole]] derivative) via a [[thioether]]. It is a pale yellow solid with a slightly bitter taste and a melting point of 238–245&nbsp;°C. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in [[lipophilic]] solvents such as chloroform, ethanol, and diethylether. It dissolves in alkaline aqueous solutions, where it [[hydrolyze]]s to 6-mercaptopurine.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

Azathioprine is synthesized from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1''H''-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]].<ref>{{cite patent |country=US |number=3056785 |status=Patent |title = Purine Derivatives |gdate=1962-10-06 |fdate=1960-05-21 | invent1=G.

==History==
Azathioprine was synthesized by [[George Herbert Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]] in 1957 (named BW&nbsp;57-322) to produce 6-MP in a metabolically active, but masked form, and at first used as a [[chemotherapy]] drug.<ref name="nobel" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Elion GB, Callahan SW, Hitchings GH, Rundles RW | title = The metabolism of 2-amino-6-[(1-methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazolyl)thio]purine (B.W. 57-323) in man | journal = Cancer Chemotherapy Reports | volume = 8 | pages = 47–52 | date = July 1960 | pmid = 13849699 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thiersch JB | title = Effect of 6-(1'-methyl-4'-nitro-5'-imidazolyl)-mercaptopurine and 2-amino-6-(1'-methyl-4'-nitro-5'-imidazolyl)-mercaptopurine on the rat litter in utero | journal = Journal of Reproduction and Fertility | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 297–302 | date = December 1962 | pmid = 13980986 | doi = 10.1530/jrf.0.0040297 }}</ref>

Robert Schwartz investigated the effect of 6-MP on the immune response in 1958 and discovered that it profoundly suppresses the formation of [[antibodies]] when given to rabbits together with [[antigen]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz R, Stack J, Dameshek W | title = Effect of 6-mercaptopurine on antibody production | journal = Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 99 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–167 | date = October 1958 | pmid = 13601801 | doi = 10.3181/00379727-99-24281 | s2cid = 8043359 }}</ref> Following the work done by Sir [[Peter Medawar]] and Gertrude Elion in discovering the immunological basis of [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] of transplanted tissues and organs, and Schwartz's researches on 6-MP, Sir [[Roy Calne]], the British pioneer in transplantation, introduced 6-MP as an experimental immunosuppressant for [[Kidney transplantation|kidney]] and [[heart transplant]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Calne RY | title = The rejection of renal homografts.
