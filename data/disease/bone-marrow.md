[[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|Bone marrow transplants]] can be conducted to treat severe diseases of the bone marrow, including certain forms of [[cancer]] such as [[leukemia]]. Several types of stem cells are related to bone marrow. [[Hematopoietic stem cell]]s in the bone marrow can give rise to hematopoietic lineage cells, and [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s, which can be isolated from the primary culture of bone marrow stroma, can give rise to bone, [[adipose tissue|adipose]], and [[cartilage]] tissue.<ref name="LindbergLamps2018">{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=Matthew R.|last2=Lamps|first2=Laura W.|title=Diagnostic Pathology: Normal Histology|chapter=Bone Marrow|year=2018|pages=130–137|doi=10.1016/B978-0-323-54803-8.50035-8|isbn=9780323548038}}</ref>

==Structure==
The composition of marrow is dynamic, as the mixture of cellular and non-cellular components (connective tissue) shifts with age and in response to systemic factors. In humans, marrow is colloquially characterized as "red" or "yellow" marrow ({{lang-la|medulla ossium rubra}}, {{lang-la|medulla ossium flava}}, respectively) depending on the prevalence of hematopoietic cells vs [[Adipocyte|fat cells]].  While the precise mechanisms underlying marrow regulation are not understood,<ref name="Birbrair n/a–n/a" /> compositional changes occur according to stereotypical patterns.<ref name="Chan 1911–1930">{{Cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=Brian Y.|last2=Gill|first2=Kara G.|last3=Rebsamen|first3=Susan L.|last4=Nguyen|first4=Jie C.|date=2016-10-01|title=MR Imaging of Pediatric Bone Marrow |journal=RadioGraphics|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1911–1930|doi=10.1148/rg.2016160056|pmid=27726743|issn=0271-5333|doi-access=}}</ref> For example, a newborn baby's bones exclusively contain hematopoietically active "red" marrow, and there is a progressive conversion towards "yellow" marrow with age. In adults, red marrow is found mainly in the [[Axial skeleton|central skeleton]], such as the [[pelvis]], [[Human sternum|sternum]], [[Human skull|cranium]], [[ribs]], [[vertebrae]] and [[scapulae]], and variably found in the proximal [[epiphysis|epiphyseal]] ends of [[long bones]] such as the [[femur]] and [[humerus]]. In circumstances of chronic hypoxia, the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase blood cell production.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Poulton|first1=T B|last2=Murphy|first2=W D|last3=Duerk|first3=J L|last4=Chapek|first4=C C|last5=Feiglin|first5=D H|date=1993-12-01|title=Bone marrow reconversion in adults who are smokers: MR Imaging findings |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=161|issue=6|pages=1217–1221|doi=10.2214/ajr.161.6.8249729|issn=0361-803X|pmid=8249729|doi-access=}}</ref>

===Stroma===
The [[Stromal cell|stroma]] of the bone marrow includes all tissue not directly involved in the marrow's primary function of [[hematopoiesis]].<ref name="Birbrair n/a–n/a"/> Stromal cells may be indirectly involved in hematopoiesis, providing a microenvironment that influences the function and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. For instance, they generate [[colony stimulating factors]], which have a significant effect on hematopoiesis. Cell types that constitute the bone marrow stroma include:
* [[fibroblasts]] ([[reticular connective tissue]])
* [[macrophages]], which contribute especially to [[red blood cell]] production, as they deliver [[iron]] for [[hemoglobin]] production.
* [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|adipocytes]] (fat cells)
* [[osteoblasts]] (synthesize bone)
* [[osteoclasts]] (resorb bone)
* [[endothelial cells]], which form the [[sinusoid blood vessel|sinusoids]]. These derive from [[endothelial stem cell]]s, which are also present in the bone marrow.<ref name=ruben/>

==Function==

=== Central hematopoietic and antigen-responsive organ ===
That bone marrow is a priming site for [[T cell|T-cell]] responses to blood-borne [[Antigen|antigens]] was first described in 2003.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Feuerer |first=Markus |last2=Beckhove |first2=Philipp |last3=Garbi |first3=Natalio |date=2003-08-10 |title=Bone marrow as a priming site for T-cell responses to blood-borne antigen |journal=Nature Medicine |issue=9 |pages=1151-1157}}</ref> Mature circulating naïve T cells home to bone marrow sinuses after they have passed through arteries and arterioles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mazo |first=I.B. |last2=von Adrian |first2=U.H. |date=1999 |title=Adhesion and homing of blood-borne cells in bone marrow microvessels |journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=25-32}}</ref> They transmigrate sinus endothelium and enter the parenchyma which contains [[Dendritic cell|dendritic cells]] (DCs).

===Mesenchymal stem cells===
{{Main|Mesenchymal stem cell}}
The bone marrow stroma contains [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSCs),<ref name=ruben/> which are also known as marrow stromal cells. These are [[multipotent]] [[stem cell]]s that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into a variety of cell types. MSCs have been shown to differentiate, [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]], into [[osteoblast]]s, [[chondrocyte]]s, [[myocyte]]s, [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|marrow adipocytes]] and [[Beta cell|beta-pancreatic islets cells]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Bone marrow barrier===
The [[blood vessel]]s of the bone marrow constitute a barrier, inhibiting immature blood cells from leaving the marrow. Only mature blood cells contain the [[membrane protein]]s, such as [[aquaporin]] and [[glycophorin]], that are required to attach to and pass the blood vessel [[endothelium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acbd.monash.org/docs/red-cell-membrane.pdf|title=The Red Cell Membrane: structure and pathologies|publisher=Australian Centre for Blood Diseases/[[Monash University]]|access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref> [[Hematopoietic stem cell]]s may also cross the bone marrow barrier, and may thus be harvested from blood.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Lymphatic role===
The red bone marrow is a key element of the [[lymphatic system]], being one of the [[Lymphatic system#Primary lymphoid organs|primary lymphoid organs]] that generate [[lymphocytes]] from immature hematopoietic [[progenitor cell]]s.<ref name="AllOnHealthLymph">[http://allonhealth.com/health-news/par-lymphatic-system.htm The Lymphatic System]. Allonhealth.com. Retrieved 5 December 2011.</ref> The bone marrow and [[thymus]] constitute the primary lymphoid tissues involved in the production and early selection of lymphocytes. Furthermore, bone marrow performs a [[valve]]-like function to prevent the backflow of [[lymphatic fluid]] in the lymphatic system.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Compartmentalization===
[[Cellular compartment|Biological compartmentalization]] is evident within the bone marrow, in that certain cell types tend to aggregate in specific areas. For instance, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]], and their [[chemical precursor|precursors]] tend to gather around [[blood vessel]]s, while [[granulocytes]] gather at the borders of the bone marrow.<ref name=ruben/>

==As food==

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===
The normal bone marrow architecture can be damaged or displaced by [[aplastic anemia]], [[cancer|malignancies]] such as [[multiple myeloma]], or infections such as [[tuberculosis]], leading to a decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets. The bone marrow can also be affected by various forms of [[leukemia]], which attacks its hematologic progenitor cells.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Human acute myeloid leukemia is organized as a hierarchy that originates from a primitive hematopoietic cell|date=1997|volume=3|issue=7|doi=10.1038/nm0797-730|pages=730–737|journal=Nature Medicine|pmid=9212098 | last1 = Bonnet | first1 = D | last2 = Dick | first2 = JE|s2cid=205381050}}</ref> Furthermore, exposure to [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] or [[chemotherapy]] will kill many of the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow, and will therefore result in a depressed [[immune system]]. Many of the symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]] are due to damage sustained by the bone marrow cells.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

To diagnose diseases involving the bone marrow, a [[bone marrow aspiration]] is sometimes performed. This typically involves using a hollow needle to acquire a sample of red bone marrow from the [[iliac crest|crest of the ilium]] under general or [[local anesthesia]].<ref name=T4/>

===Application of stem cells in therapeutics===

Bone marrow derived stem cells have a wide array of application in regenerative medicine.<ref>
{{cite journal |vauthors=Mahla RS| title = Stem cells application in regenerative medicine and disease threpeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology  | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 1–24 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 | pmc=4969512| doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Imaging===
Medical imaging may provide a limited amount of information regarding bone marrow. [[Radiograph|Plain film x-rays]] pass through soft tissues such as marrow and do not provide visualization, although any changes in the structure of the associated bone may be detected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ellmann|first1=Stephan|last2=Beck|first2=Michael|last3=Kuwert|first3=Torsten|last4=Uder|first4=Michael|last5=Bäuerle|first5=Tobias|title=Multimodal imaging of bone metastases: From preclinical to clinical applications |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Translation|volume=3|issue=4|pages=166–177|doi=10.1016/j.jot.2015.07.004|pmid=30035055|pmc=5986987|year=2015}}</ref> [[Computed tomography|CT]] imaging has somewhat better capacity for assessing the marrow cavity of bones, although with low sensitivity and specificity. For example, normal fatty "yellow" marrow in adult long bones is of low density (-30 to -100 Hounsfield units), between subcutaneous fat and soft tissue. Tissue with increased cellular composition, such as normal "red" marrow or cancer cells within the medullary cavity will measure variably higher in density.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nishida|first1=Y|last2=Matsue|first2=Y|last3=Suehara|first3=Y|last4=Fukumoto|first4=K|last5=Fujisawa|first5=M|last6=Takeuchi|first6=M|last7=Ouchi|first7=E|last8=Matsue|first8=K|date=August 2015|title=Clinical and prognostic significance of bone marrow abnormalities in the appendicular skeleton detected by low-doe whole-body multidetector computed tomography in patients with multiple myeloma |journal=Blood Cancer Journal|language=En|volume=5|issue=7|page=e329|doi=10.1038/bcj.2015.57|pmid=26230953|pmc=4526783|issn=2044-5385}}</ref>

[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is more sensitive and specific for assessing bone composition. MRI enables assessment of the average molecular composition of soft tissues and thus provides information regarding the relative fat content of marrow. In adult humans, "yellow" fatty marrow is the dominant tissue in bones, particularly in the (peripheral) [[appendicular skeleton]]. Because fat molecules have a high [[T1-weighted MRI|T1-relaxivity]], T1-weighted imaging sequences show "yellow" fatty marrow as bright (hyperintense). Furthermore, normal fatty marrow loses signal on fat-saturation sequences, in a similar pattern to subcutaneous fat.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

When "yellow" fatty marrow becomes replaced by tissue with more cellular composition, this change is apparent as decreased brightness on T1-weighted sequences. Both normal "red" marrow and pathologic marrow lesions (such as cancer) are darker than "yellow" marrow on T1-weight sequences, although can often be distinguished by comparison with the MR signal intensity of adjacent soft tissues. Normal "red" marrow is typically equivalent or brighter than skeletal muscle or intervertebral disc on T1-weighted sequences.<ref name="Chan 1911–1930"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poulton|first1=TB|last2=Murphy|first2=WD|last3=Duerk|first3=JL|last4=Chapek|first4=CC|last5=Feiglin|first5=DH|date=December 1993|title=Bone marrow reconversion in adults who are smokers: MR Imaging findings.|journal=AJR.

Fatty marrow change, the inverse of red marrow [[hyperplasia]], can occur with normal aging,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=LM|last2=Hanrahan|first2=CJ|title=MRI of spinal bone marrow: part I, techniques and normal age-related appearances.|journal=AJR.

Diffuse marrow T1 hypointensity without contrast enhancement or cortical discontinuity suggests red marrow conversion or [[myelofibrosis]]. Falsely normal marrow on T1 can be seen with diffuse [[multiple myeloma]] or [[leukemia|leukemic]] infiltration when the water to fat ratio is not sufficiently altered, as may be seen with lower grade tumors or earlier in the disease process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vande Berg|first1=BC|last2=Lecouvet|first2=FE|last3=Galant|first3=C|last4=Maldague|first4=BE|last5=Malghem|first5=J|title=Normal variants and frequent marrow alterations that simulate bone marrow lesions at MR imaging.|journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America|date=July 2005|volume=43|issue=4|pages=761–70, ix|pmid=15893536|doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2005.01.007}}</ref>

===Histology===
{{Main|Bone marrow examination}}
[[Image:acute leukemia-ALL.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A [[Wright's stain|Wright's-stain]]ed bone marrow aspirate smear from a patient with [[leukemia]]]]
Bone marrow examination is the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained via [[biopsy]] and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, [[anemia]], and [[pancytopenia]]. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including [[platelet]]s, [[red blood cell]]s and [[white blood cell]]s. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by [[Venipuncture|phlebotomy]]), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

The ratio between [[Myeloid cell|myeloid series]] and [[erythroid]] cells is relevant to bone marrow function, and also to diseases of the bone marrow and [[peripheral blood]], such as leukemia and anemia. The normal myeloid-to-erythroid ratio is around 3:1; this ratio may increase in [[myelogenous leukemia]]s, decrease in [[polycythemia]]s, and reverse in cases of [[thalassemia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=75938|title=Definition: 'M:E Ratio'|publisher=Stedman's Medical Dictionary via MediLexicon.com|date=2006|access-date=20 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510180720/http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=75938|archive-date=10 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Donation and transplantation===
{{Main|Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation}}
[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|A bone marrow harvest in progress]]
[[File:Site for procedure of Bone Marrow.jpg|thumb|The preferred sites for the procedure]]
In a [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplant]], hematopoietic stem cells are removed from a person and infused into another person ([[allogenic]]) or into the same person at a later time ([[autologous]]). If the donor and recipient are compatible, these infused cells will then travel to the bone marrow and initiate blood cell production. Transplantation from one person to another is conducted for the treatment of severe bone marrow diseases, such as congenital defects, autoimmune diseases or malignancies. The patient's own marrow is first killed off with drugs or [[radiotherapy|radiation]], and then the new stem cells are introduced. Before radiation therapy or [[chemotherapy]] in cases of [[cancer]], some of the patient's hematopoietic stem cells are sometimes harvested and later infused back when the therapy is finished to restore the immune system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/bone-marrow-transplantation-stem-cell-transplantation-beyond-the-basics|title=Bone marrow transplantation|publisher=UpToDate.com|access-date=12 April 2014}}</ref>

====Harvesting====
The stem cells are typically harvested directly from the red marrow in the [[iliac crest]], often under [[general anesthesia]]. The procedure is minimally invasive and does not require stitches afterwards. Depending on the donor's health and reaction to the procedure, the actual harvesting can be an [[outpatient surgery|outpatient procedure]], or can require 1–2 days of recovery in the hospital.<ref>[http://www.marrow.org/DONOR/When_You_re_Asked_to_Donate_fo/index.html National Marrow Donor Program Donor Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908124705/http://www.marrow.org/DONOR/When_You_re_Asked_to_Donate_fo/index.html |date=8 September 2008 }}. Marrow.org. Retrieved 5 November 2012.</ref>

Another option is to administer certain drugs that stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into circulating blood.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bone-marrow/CA00047 Bone marrow donation: What to expect when you donate]. Mayo Clinic. Retrieved 16 February 2013.</ref> An [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[Peripheral venous catheter|catheter]] is inserted into the donor's arm, and the stem cells are then filtered out of the blood. This procedure is similar to that used in blood or platelet donation. In adults, bone marrow may also be taken from the [[Human sternum|sternum]], while the [[tibia]] is often used when taking samples from infants.<ref name=T4>{{cite web|url=http://www.labtestsonline.org.uk/understanding/analytes/bone-marrow/tab/sample|title=Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy|publisher=Lab Tests Online UK|access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref> In newborns, stem cells may be retrieved from the [[umbilical cord]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = McGuckin | first1 = C.

===Persistent viruses===
Using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) a maximum of five DNA viruses per individual have been identified. Included were several herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and human papillomavirus 31. Given the reactivation and/or oncogenic potential of these viruses, their repercussion on hematopoietic and malignant disorders calls for further studies.<ref name=Toppinen2021>{{cite journal |last1=Toppinen |first1=Mari|last2=Sajantila|first2=Antti|last3=Pratas|first3=Diogo|last4=Hedman |first4=Klaus|last5=Perdomo |first5=Maria F.|year=2021 |title=The Human Bone Marrow Is Host to the DNAs of Several Viruses |journal=Front.
