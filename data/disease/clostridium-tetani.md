'''''Clostridium tetani''''' is a common soil bacterium and the causative agent of [[tetanus]]. Vegetative cells of ''Clostridium tetani'' are usually [[bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]] and up to 2.5 [[micrometres|μm]] long, but they become enlarged and [[tennis racket]]- or drumstick-shaped when forming [[endospore|spore]]s. ''C. tetani'' spores are extremely hardy and can be found globally in soil or in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] of animals. If inoculated into a wound, ''C. tetani'' can grow and produce a potent toxin, [[tetanospasmin]], which interferes with motor neurons, causing tetanus. The toxin's action can be prevented with [[tetanus toxoid]] vaccines, which are often administered to children worldwide.

==Evolution==
''Clostridium tetani'' is classified within the genus ''Clostridium'', a broad group of over 150 species of Gram-positive bacteria.<ref name=Rainey2015/> ''C. tetani'' falls within a cluster of nearly 100 species that are more closely related to each other than they are to any other genus.<ref name=Rainey2015/> This cluster includes other pathogenic ''Clostridium'' species such as ''[[Clostridium botulinum|C. botulinum]]'' and ''[[Clostridium perfringens|C. perfringens]]''.<ref name=Rainey2015/> The closest relative to ''C. tetani'' is ''[[Clostridium cochlearium|C. cochlearium]]''.<ref name=Rainey2015/> Other ''Clostridium'' species can be divided into a number of genetically related groups, many of which are more closely related to members of other genera than they are to ''C. tetani''.<ref name=Rainey2015/> Examples of this include the human pathogen ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|C. difficile]]'', which is more closely related to members of genus ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'' than to ''C. tetani''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Clostridia: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis |veditors=Rood JI, McClane BA, Songer JG, Titball RW |chapter=Chapter 1 - Phylogenetic Relationships |vauthors=Stackebrandt E, Rainey FA |date=1997 |pages=3–19 |doi=10.1016/B978-012595020-6/50003-6|isbn=9780125950206 }}</ref>

==Role in disease==
[[File:Opisthotonus in a patient suffering from tetanus - Painting by Sir Charles Bell - 1809.jpg|thumb|A man suffering muscle spasms from tetanus, painted by [[Charles Bell]] in 1809]]
While ''C. tetani'' is frequently benign in the soil or in the intestinal tracts of animals, it can sometimes cause the severe disease [[tetanus]]. Disease generally begins with spores entering the body through a wound.<ref name=Todar>{{cite book|author=Todar K |date=2005 |page=3 |url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/clostridia_3.html |access-date=24 June 2018 |chapter=Pathogenic Clostridia, including Botulism and Tetanus |title=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology}}</ref> In deep wounds, such as those from a puncture or contaminated needle injection the combination of [[necrosis|tissue death]] and limited exposure to surface air can result in a very low-oxygen environment, allowing ''C. tetani'' spores to [[Germination#Spore germination|germinate]] and grow.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=7 |chapter=Chapter 29: ''Clostridium, Bacteroides'', and Other Anaerobes |editor=Ryan KJ |date=2018 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-1-259-85980-9 |vauthors=Pottinger P, Reller B, Ryan KJ, Weissman S}}</ref> As ''C. tetani'' grows at the wound site, it releases the [[exotoxin|toxins]] [[tetanolysin]] and [[tetanospasmin]] as cells lyse.<ref name=Roper/> The function of tetanolysin is unclear, although it may help ''C. tetani'' to establish infection within a wound.<ref name=PinkBook/><ref name=Roper/> Tetanospasmin ("tetanus toxin") is one of the most potent toxins known, with an estimated lethal dose less than 2.5 [[nanogram]]s per kilogram of body weight, and is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus.<ref name=PinkBook/><ref name=Roper/> Tetanospasmin spreads via the [[lymphatic system]] and bloodstream throughout the body, where it is taken up into various parts of the [[nervous system]].<ref name=PinkBook>{{cite book|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html |access-date=24 June 2018 |title=The Pink Book - Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |veditors=Hamborsky J, Kroger A, Wolfe C |date=2015 |edition=13 |chapter=Chapter 21: Tetanus |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |pages=341–352}}</ref> In the nervous system, tetanospasmin acts by blocking the release of the inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]]s [[glycine]] and [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] at [[motor nerve]] endings.<ref name=Todar/> This blockade leads to the widespread activation of [[motor neuron]]s and [[spasm]]ing of muscles throughout the body.<ref name=PinkBook/> These muscle spasms generally begin at the top of the body and move down, beginning about 8 days after infection with [[Trismus|lockjaw]], followed by spasms of the abdominal muscles and the limbs.<ref name=Todar/><ref name=PinkBook/> Muscle spasms continue for several weeks.<ref name=PinkBook/>

The gene encoding tetanospasmin is found on a [[plasmid]] carried by many strains of ''C. tetani''; strains of bacteria lacking the plasmid are unable to produce toxin.<ref name=Roper/><ref name=Todar/> The function of tetanospasmin in bacterial physiology is unknown.<ref name=Roper/>

===Treatment and prevention===
''Clostridium tetani'' is susceptible to a number of [[antibiotic]]s, including [[chloramphenicol]], [[clindamycin]], [[erythromycin]], [[penicillin G]], and [[tetracycline]].<ref name=Rainey2015/> However, the usefulness of treating ''C. tetani'' infections with antibiotics remains unclear.<ref name=Roper/> Instead, tetanus is often treated with [[tetanus immune globulin]] to bind up circulating tetanospasmin.<ref name=PinkBook/> Additionally, [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[muscle relaxant]]s may be given to reduce the effects of the muscle spasms.<ref name=Roper/>

Damage from ''C. tetani'' infection is generally prevented by administration of a [[tetanus vaccine]] consisting of tetanospasmin inactivated by [[formaldehyde]], called tetanus toxoid.<ref name=Roper/> This is made commercially by growing large quantities of ''C. tetani'' in [[fermenter]]s, then purifying the toxin and inactivating in 40% formaldehyde for 4–6 weeks.<ref name=Roper/> The toxoid is generally coadministered with [[diphtheria toxoid]] and some form of [[pertussis vaccine]] as [[DPT vaccine]] or [[DTaP]].<ref name=PinkBook/> This is given in several doses spaced out over months or years to elicit an immune response that protects the host from the effects of the toxin.<ref name=PinkBook/>

==Research==
''Clostridium tetani'' can be grown on various anaerobic [[growth media]] such as [[Thioglycolate broth|thioglycolate media]], [[casein hydrolysate media]], and [[blood agar]].<ref name=Roper/> Cultures grow particularly well on media at a neutral to alkaline pH, supplemented with [[reducing agent]]s.<ref name=Roper/> The genome of a ''C. tetani'' strain has been sequenced, containing 2.80 million [[base pair]]s with 2,373 protein coding genes.<ref>{{Cite journal  |vauthors = Bruggemann H, Baumer S, Fricke WF, Wiezer A, Liesegang H, Decker I, Herzberg C, Martinez-Arias R, Merkl R, Henne A, Gottschalk G | title = The genome sequence of Clostridium tetani, the causative agent of tetanus disease | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 1316–1321 |date=Feb 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0335853100 | pmid = 12552129 | pmc = 298770 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.1316B | display-authors = 8 | url = https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/10903/1/pq0303001316.pdf | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==History==
Clinical descriptions of tetanus associated with wounds are found at least as far back as the 4th century [[BCE]], in [[Hippocrates]]' ''[[Aphorisms (Hippocrates)|Aphorisms]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Notes on tetanus (lockjaw) |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=332 |year=1996 |pmid=8609513 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.60.3.332|pmc=1073859}}</ref> The first clear connection to the soil was in 1884, when [[Arthur Nicolaier]] showed that animals injected with soil samples would develop tetanus.<ref name=PinkBook/> In 1889, ''C. tetani'' was isolated from a human victim by [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]], who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific [[antibodies]]. In 1897, [[Edmond Nocard]] showed that tetanus antitoxin induced [[passive immunity]] in humans, and could be used for [[prophylaxis]] and treatment.<ref name=PinkBook/> In [[World War I]], injection of tetanus [[antiserum]] from horses was widely used as a prophylaxis against tetanus in wounded soldiers, leading to a dramatic decrease in tetanus cases over the course of the war.<ref name=Wever>{{cite journal|title=Prevention of tetanus during the First World War |vauthors=Wever PC, Bergen L |volume=38 |issue=2 |journal=Medical Humanities |doi=10.1136/medhum-2011-010157 |date=2012|pages=78–82 |pmid=22543225 |s2cid=30610331 |url=https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/files/479886/Van_Bergen_-_Prevention_of_tetanus_during_the_First_World_War.pdf |hdl=20.500.11755/8e372c60-b6a6-4638-a2ba-664e20b30ad1 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> The modern method of inactivating tetanus toxin with formaldehyde was developed by [[Gaston Ramon]] in the 1920s; this led to the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine by P. Descombey in 1924, which was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.<ref name=PinkBook/>
