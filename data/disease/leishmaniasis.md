==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Leishmaniasis ulcer.jpg|thumb|right|Cutaneous leishmaniasis ulcer]]
The symptoms of leishmaniasis are [[skin sores]] which erupt weeks to months after the person is bitten by infected sand flies.

Leishmaniasis may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book| first1 = William D | last1 = James | first2 = Timothy G | last2 = Berger | first3 = Dirk M | last3 = Elston |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=422–428 |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 }}</ref>
* [[Cutaneous leishmaniasis]] is the most common form, which causes an open sore at each bite site, which heals in a few months to a year and half, leaving an unpleasant-looking [[scar]].<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name=Barrett2012/>
** Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis produces widespread skin lesions which resemble [[leprosy]], and may not heal on their own.<ref name=Barrett2012/>

* [[Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis]] causes both skin and [[mucosa]]l ulcers with damage primarily of the nose and mouth.<ref name=WHO2014/><ref name=Barrett2012/>
* [[Visceral leishmaniasis]] or ''kala-azar'' ('black fever') is the most serious form, and is generally fatal if untreated.<ref name=WHO2014/> Other consequences, which can occur a few months to years after infection, include [[fever]], damage to the [[spleen]] and [[liver]], and [[anemia]].<ref name=WHO2014/>

Leishmaniasis is considered one of the classic causes of a [[splenomegaly|markedly enlarged (and therefore palpable) spleen]]; the organ, which is not normally felt during examination of the abdomen, may even become larger than the liver in severe cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Cause==
[[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Lifecycle of ''Leishmania'']]
Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female [[Phlebotominae|phlebotomine]] sandflies<ref name=WHO2014/> which can transmit the [[protozoa]] ''[[Leishmania]]''.<ref name=WHO2014/> '''(1)'''&nbsp;The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic [[promastigote]]s, during blood meals. '''(2)'''&nbsp;Metacyclic promastigotes in the puncture wound are [[Phagocytosis|phagocytized]] by [[macrophage]]s, and '''(3)'''&nbsp;transform into [[amastigote]]s. '''(4)'''&nbsp;Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on the host, and in part on which ''Leishmania'' species is involved. These differing tissue specificities cause the differing clinical manifestations of the various forms of leishmaniasis. '''(5,6)'''&nbsp;Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes. '''(7)'''&nbsp;In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes, '''(8)'''&nbsp;which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis.

The [[genome]]s of three ''Leishmania'' [[species]] (''L.&nbsp;major'', ''L.&nbsp;infantum'', and ''L.&nbsp;braziliensis'') have been sequenced, and this has provided much information about the biology of the [[parasite]]. For example, in ''Leishmania'', protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large [[polycistronic]] units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner; [[RNA polymerase]]&nbsp;II transcribes long polycistronic messages in the absence of defined RNA&nbsp;pol&nbsp;II promoters, and ''Leishmania'' has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for urgently needed drugs and aid the development of vaccines.<ref name="Myler2008" />

===Vector===
Although most of the literature mentions only one genus transmitting ''Leishmania'' to humans (''[[Lutzomyia]]'') in the New World, a 2003 study by Galati suggested a new classification for New World sand flies, elevating several subgenera to the genus level. Elsewhere in the world, the genus ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' is considered the vector of leishmaniasis.<ref name="Myler2008">{{cite book | first1 = Peter J | last1 = Myler | first2 = Nicolas | last2 = Fasel |title=Leishmania: After The Genome |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/leish |isbn=978-1-904455-28-8 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423224948/http://www.horizonpress.com/leish |archive-date=23 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

===Possible non-human reservoirs===
Some cases of infection of non-human animals of human-infecting species of Leishmania have been observed. In one study, ''L. major'' was identified in twelve out of ninety-one wild [[western lowland gorilla]] fecal samples<ref>{{cite journal

===Organisms===
Visceral disease is usually caused by ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'', ''L.&nbsp;infantum'', or ''L.&nbsp;chagasi'',<ref name=Barrett2012/> but occasionally these species may cause other forms of disease.<ref name=Barrett2012/> The cutaneous form of the disease is caused by more than 15 species of ''Leishmania''.<ref name=Barrett2012/>

===Risk factors===
Risk factors include malnutrition, deforestation, lack of sanitation, suppressed immune system and urbanization.<ref name=WHO2014/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Leishmania 2009-04-14 smear.JPG|thumb|right|Bone marrow aspirate smear: visceral leishmaniasis]]
Leishmaniasis is diagnosed in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the [[amastigotes]] (Leishman–Donovan bodies). [[Buffy-coat]] preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide to make a thin smear and stained with [[Leishman stain]] or [[Giemsa stain]] ([[pH]] 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped [[kinetoplast]]. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Dacie | first1 = John V. | last2 = Bain | first2 = Barbara J. | first3 = Imelda | last3 = Bates |title=Dacie and Lewis practical hematology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-443-06660-3 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, they are not the standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}.

Several different [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests are available for the detection of ''Leishmania'' DNA.<ref name=Barrett2012/> With this assay, a specific and sensitive diagnostic procedure is finally possible. The most sensitive PCR tests use minicircle kinetoplast DNA found in the parasite. Kinetoplast DNA contains sequences for mitochondrial proteins in its maxicircles(~25–50 per parasite), and guide RNA in its minicircles(~10'000 per parasite) of the kinetoplast. With this specific method, one can still detect Leishmania even with a very low parasite load. When needing to diagnose a specific species of Leishmania, as opposed to only detection, other PCR methods have been superior.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bensoussan E, Nasereddin A, Jonas F, Schnur LF, Jaffe CL | title = Comparison of PCR assays for diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1435–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16597873 | pmc = 1448629 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.44.4.1435-1439.2006 }}</ref>

Most forms of the disease are transmitted only from nonhuman animals,  but some can be spread between humans. Infections in humans are caused by about 21 of 30 species that infect mammals;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/biology.html|title=Parasites – Leishmaniasis|date=January 2013|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> the different species look the same, but they can be differentiated by [[isoenzyme]] analysis, DNA [[sequence analysis]], or [[monoclonal antibodies]].

==Prevention==
* Using insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide)<ref name="Prevention">{{cite web|last=Prevention|first=CDC-Centers for Disease Control and|date=2020-02-19|title=CDC – Leishmaniasis – Prevention & Control|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/prevent.html|access-date=2021-06-26|website=cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref>
* Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by using nets treated with [[insecticide]] or insect repellent while sleeping.<ref name="WHO2014" /> To provide good protection against sandflies, fine mesh sizes of 0.6&nbsp;mm or less are required, but a [[mosquito net]] with 1.2mm mesh will provide a limited reduction in the number of sandfly bites.<ref name="contphle" /> Finer mesh sizes have the downside of higher cost and reduced air circulation which can cause overheating. Many [[Phlebotominae|Phlebotomine]] sandfly attacks occur at sunset rather than at night, so it may also be useful to put nets over doors and windows or to use [[insect repellents]].<ref name="Prevention"/>
* Use of insecticide-impregnated dog collars and treatment or culling of infected dogs.{{cn|date=January 2023}}
* Spraying houses and animal shelters with insecticides.<ref name=contphle>* {{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander B, Maroli M | title = Control of phlebotomine sandflies | journal = Medical and Veterinary Entomology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12680919 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2915.2003.00420.x | s2cid = 31387956 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Paromomycin structure.svg|thumb|right|[[Paromomycin]] is an inexpensive (US$10) and effective treatment for leishmaniasis.]]
The treatment is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of ''Leishmania'', and the type of infection.<ref name=WHO2014/>
<!-- Visceral -->
For visceral leishmaniasis in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, [[liposomal amphotericin B]] is the recommended treatment and is often used as a single dose.<ref name=Barrett2012/><ref name=Sun2013/> Rates of cure with a single dose of [[amphotericin]] have been reported as 95%.<ref name=Barrett2012/> In India, almost all infections are resistant to [[pentavalent antimonials]].<ref name=Barrett2012/> In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended.<ref name="Sun2013"/> These, however, can have significant side effects.<ref name=Barrett2012/> [[Miltefosine]], an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis.<ref name="Dor2012"/> Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause [[birth defects]] if taken within three months of getting pregnant.<ref name=Barrett2012/><ref name=Dor2012/> It does not appear to work for ''L. major'' or ''L. braziliensis''.<ref name=Min2007/>

<!-- Cutaneous  -->
The evidence around the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor.<ref name=Barrett2012/> A number of topical treatments may be used for cutaneous leishmaniasis.

[[File:JerichoButtons.jpg|thumb|A 1917 case of [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] in the [[Middle East]], known then locally as "Jericho buttons" for the frequency of cases near the ancient city of [[Jericho]]]]

Descriptions of conspicuous lesions similar to cutaneous leishmaniasis appear on [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from King [[Ashurbanipal]] from the seventh century BCE, some of which may have derived from even earlier texts from 1500 to 2500 BCE. [[Persia]]n physicians, including [[Avicenna]] in the 10th century CE, gave detailed descriptions of what was called ''[[balkh]]'' sore.<ref>

Physicians in the [[Indian subcontinent]] would describe it as ''kala-azar'' (pronounced ''kālā āzār'', the [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] phrase for "black fever", ''kālā'' meaning black and ''āzār'' meaning fever or disease). In the [[Americas]], evidence of the cutaneous form of the disease in [[Ecuador]] and Peru appears in [[pre-Inca]] pottery depicting skin lesions and deformed faces dating back to the first century CE. Some 15th- and 16th-century texts from the [[Inca]] period and from [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonials]] mention "valley sickness", "Andean sickness", or "white leprosy", which are likely to be the cutaneous form.<ref>{{cite web | title = WHO: Leishmaniasis background information – a brief history of the disease | url =https://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/ | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315040939/http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/ | archive-date = 15 March 2014 | df = dmy-all }}

[[The Institute for OneWorld Health]] has reintroduced the drug [[paromomycin]] for treatment of leishmaniasis, results with which led to its approval as an [[orphan drug]]. The [[Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative]] is also actively facilitating the search for novel therapeutics. A treatment with paromomycin will cost about US$10. The drug had originally been identified in the 1950s, but had been abandoned because it would not be profitable, as the disease mostly affects poor people.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/health/31charity.html |title = A Small Charity Takes the Reins in Fighting a Neglected Disease |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220101801/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/health/31charity.html |archive-date = 20 December 2016 |work = [[New York Times]] |date = 31 July 2006 }}</ref> The [[Indian government]] approved paromomycin for sale in August 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldhealth.org/drug_program |title=Drug Program – Clinical Trial of Paromomycin |publisher=[[Institute for OneWorld Health]] |access-date=10 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606042359/http://www.oneworldhealth.org/drug_program |archive-date= 6 June 2010 }}</ref>
