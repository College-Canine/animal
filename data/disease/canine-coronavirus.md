'''Canine coronavirus''' (CCoV) is an [[Viral envelope|enveloped]], [[Sense (molecular biology)|positive-sense]], [[RNA|single-stranded]] [[RNA virus]]  which is a member of the species ''Alphacoronavirus 1.'' It causes a highly contagious intestinal disease worldwide in dogs.<ref name="vetres">{{cite journal|author=Pratelli A|year=2006|title=Genetic evolution of canine coronavirus and recent advances in prophylaxis|journal=Vet Res|volume=37|issue=2|pages=191–200|doi=10.1051/vetres:2005053|pmid=16472519|doi-access=free}}</ref> The infecting virus enters its host cell by binding to the [[Alanine aminopeptidase|APN receptor]].<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Fehr AR, Perlman S|title=Coronaviruses|date=2015|chapter=Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|publisher=Springer|volume=1282|pages=1–23|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1|isbn=978-1-4939-2438-7|pmc=4369385|pmid=25720466|quote=See Table 1.|veditors=Maier HJ, Bickerton E, Britton P}}</ref> It was discovered in 1971 in [[Germany]] during an outbreak in [[guard dog|sentry dog]]s.<ref name="vetres" /> The virus is a member of the genus ''[[Alphacoronavirus]]'' and subgenus ''Tegacovirus''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Tree&id=11153&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock|title=Taxonomy browser (Canine coronavirus)|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

==Canine enteric coronavirus==
===Pathology===
The virus invades and replicates in the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] of the [[small intestine]].  Intestinal disease may be related to virus-induced [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) of cells of the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Canine coronavirus induces apoptosis in cultured cells |journal=Vet Microbiol |volume= 121|issue= 1–2|pages= 64–72|year= 2007|pmid=17254720 |last1= Ruggieri |first1= A |last2= Di Trani |first2= L |last3= Gatto |first3= I |last4= Franco |first4= M |last5= Vignolo |first5= E |last6= Bedini |first6= B |last7= Elia |first7= G |last8= Buonavoglia |first8= C |doi= 10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.12.016|pmc=7117493 |doi-access= free }}</ref>  Canine coronavirus was originally thought to cause serious gastrointestinal disease, but now most cases are considered to be very mild or without symptoms.<ref name=Carmichael>{{cite web|author=Pratelli, A.|year=2005|title=Canine Coronavirus Infection|work=Recent Advances in Canine Infectious Diseases|url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Infect_Dis_Carmichael/Pratelli/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|access-date=2006-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410180053/http://www.ivis.org/advances/Infect_Dis_Carmichael/pratelli/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|archive-date=2005-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A more serious complication of canine coronavirus occurs when the dog is also infected with [[canine parvovirus]].  Coronavirus infection of the intestinal villi makes the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s more susceptible to parvovirus infection.  This causes a much more severe disease than either virus can separately.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  However, fatal intestinal disease associated with canine coronavirus without the presence of canine parvovirus is still occasionally reported.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Evermann J, Abbott J, Han S |title=Canine coronavirus-associated puppy mortality without evidence of concurrent canine parvovirus infection |journal=J Vet Diagn Invest |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=610–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16475526 |doi=10.1177/104063870501700618|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buonavoglia C, Decaro N, Martella V, Elia G, Campolo M, Desario C, Castagnaro M, Tempesta M |title=Canine coronavirus highly pathogenic for dogs |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=492–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16704791 |doi= 10.3201/eid1203.050839|pmc=3291441}}</ref>  This may be related to the high mutation rate of RNA positive stranded viruses, of which canine coronavirus is one.<ref name=vetres/>

===Symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and control===
{{See also|DA2PPC vaccine}}
The [[incubation period]] is one to three days.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7216-6795-9}}</ref>  The disease is highly contagious and is spread through the [[feces]] of infected dogs, who usually shed the virus for six to nine days, but sometimes for six months following infection.<ref name=Carmichael/>  Symptoms include [[diarrhea]], vomiting, and anorexia.  Diagnosis is through detection of virus particles in the feces.  Treatment usually only requires medication for diarrhea, but more severely affected dogs may require [[intravenous fluids]] for [[dehydration]].  Fatalities are rare.  The virus is destroyed by most available [[disinfectant]]s.  There is a vaccine available ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I07|AD11}}), and it is usually given to puppies, who are more susceptible to canine coronavirus, and to dogs that have a high risk of exposure, such as show dogs.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>

==Canine respiratory coronavirus==

Recently, a second type of canine coronavirus (Group II) has been shown to cause respiratory disease in dogs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ellis, John A.|year=2006|title=Outbreak!

==Human infection==
A study published on May 20, 2021, analyzed samples from eight patients with pneumonia (seven of whom were children) in hospitals of [[Sibu]] and [[Kapit]], [[Malaysia]], taken between 2017 and 2018 and found a novel coronavirus. This coronavirus is a species of Canine coronavirus (CCoV) which was named  [[CCoV-HuPn-2018]] and was found to have multiple similarities to [[feline coronavirus]], [[transmissible gastroenteritis virus|swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus]] and some human and [[SARSr-CoV|SARS-like]] coronaviruses. Most of these affect the spike protein and it is thought the virus could have undergone genetic recombination to achieve those traits. If this strain is confirmed to be associated with human disease then it would become the eighth known coronavirus to cause disease in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Novel Canine Coronavirus Isolated from a Hospitalized Pneumonia Patient, East Malaysia |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |year=2021 |doi=10.1093/cid/ciab456 |pmid=34013321 |last1=Vlasova |first1=A.
