'''Ataxia''' (from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = "lack of order") is a [[neurological sign]] consisting of lack of voluntary [[Motor coordination|coordination of muscle movements]] that can include [[gait abnormality]], speech changes, and abnormalities in [[eye movements]], that indicates dysfunction of parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]].

These nervous system dysfunctions occur in several different patterns, with different results and different possible causes. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dystaxia Definition & Meaning |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dystaxia |access-date=2023-09-13 |website=Dictionary.com |language=en}}</ref>

People with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform [[tandem gait]]. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> [[Dysarthria]], an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by "scanning" speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm, and variable volume.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /> Also, slurring of speech, tremor of the voice, and [[ataxic respiration]] may occur. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. Overshooting (or hypermetria) occurs with finger-to-nose testing and heel to shin testing; thus, [[dysmetria]] is evident.<ref name ="Schmahmann" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Godaux E, Jacquy J | title = Cerebellar hypermetria is larger when the inertial load is artificially increased | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–52 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8285591 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410350108 | s2cid = 19328973 }}</ref> Impairments with alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), as well as [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], may also be displayed. Tremor of the head and trunk ([[titubation]]) may be seen in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.<ref name ="Schmahmann" />

Dysmetria is thought to be caused by a deficit in the control of interaction [[torque]]s in multijoint motion.<ref name="pmid10805697">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastian AJ, Zackowski KM, Thach WT | title = Cerebellar ataxia: torque deficiency or torque mismatch between joints? | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 3019–3030 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10805697 | doi = 10.1152/jn.2000.83.5.3019 | s2cid = 10244619 }}</ref> Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations.
* [[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]] ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid titubation (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is, therefore, worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based "drunken sailor" [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia),<ref name="Blumenfeld">{{cite book | vauthors = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | url = https://archive.org/details/neuroanatomythro00blum | url-access = limited | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/neuroanatomythro00blum/page/n342 670]–671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }}</ref> characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, [[falling (accident)|falling]] is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74–93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling.<ref name="pmid20157791">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonteyn EM, Schmitz-Hübsch T, Verstappen CC, Baliko L, Bloem BR, Boesch S, Bunn L, Charles P, Dürr A, Filla A, Giunti P, Globas C, Klockgether T, Melegh B, Pandolfo M, De Rosa A, Schöls L, Timmann D, Munneke M, Kremer BP, van de Warrenburg BP | title = Falls in spinocerebellar ataxias: Results of the EuroSCA Fall Study | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–239 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20157791 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-010-0155-z | s2cid = 23247877 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15645525">{{cite journal | vauthors = van de Warrenburg BP, Steijns JA, Munneke M, Kremer BP, Bloem BR | title = Falls in degenerative cerebellar ataxias | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 497–500 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15645525 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20375 | s2cid = 35160189 }}</ref>

** Peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining)
** A peculiar pattern of [[dysarthria]] (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm)
** Inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as dysdiadochokinesia, occurs, and could involve rapidly switching from [[pronation]] to [[supination]] of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.<ref name="Schmitz">{{cite book | chapter = Examination of Coordination |vauthors=Schmitz TJ, O'Sullivan SB | title = Physical rehabilitation | url = https://archive.org/details/physicalrehabili00osul | url-access = limited | publisher = F.A.

** Inability to judge distances or ranges of movement happens. This dysmetria is often seen as undershooting, [[hypometria]], or overshooting, [[hypermetria]], the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone's finger or touch his or her own nose.<ref name="Schmitz" />
** The rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex, is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia, for example, when  patients are flexing their elbows isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patients' arms may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patients check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.<ref name="Schmitz" />
** Patients may exhibit a constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms, which are gathered under the terminology of [[Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome|Schmahmann's syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Manto M, Mariën P | title = Schmahmann's syndrome - identification of the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology | journal = Cerebellum & Ataxias | volume = 2 | pages = 2 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26331045 | pmc = 4552302 | doi = 10.1186/s40673-015-0023-1 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

=== Sensory ===
The term [[sensory ataxia]] is used to indicate ataxia due to loss of [[proprioception]], the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s.<ref name="pmid9184691"/>

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady "stomping" gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sensory Ataxia |url=https://www.physio-pedia.com/Sensory_Ataxia |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=Physiopedia |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Ruppert L, Kendig T  |title=A Pt Intervention for a Patient with Sensory Ataxia in the Acute Care Oncology Setting |date=2012 |url=https://journals.lww.com/rehabonc/Citation/2012/30010/A_PT_INTERVENTION_FOR_A_PATIENT_WITH_SENSORY.10.aspx |journal=Rehabilitation Oncology |language=en-US |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |doi=10.1097/01893697-201230010-00010 |issn=2168-3808|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having patients stand with their feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall; this is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when patients are standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patients' fingers tend to "fall down" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the "ataxic hand").<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Halmágyi GM, Curthoys IS | title = Vestibular contributions to the Romberg test: Testing semicircular canal and otolith function | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 3211–3219 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34160115 | doi = 10.1111/ene.14942 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Forbes J, Munakomi S, Cronovich H | chapter = Romberg Test |date=2024 | title = StatPearls | chapter-url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563187/ |access-date=2024-04-16 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=33085334 }}</ref>

=== Vestibular ===
The term vestibular ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashizawa T, Xia G | title = Ataxia | journal = Continuum | volume = 22 | issue = 4 Movement Disorders | pages = 1208–1226 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27495205 | pmc = 5567218 | doi = 10.1212/CON.0000000000000362 }}</ref>

== Causes ==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, so can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ataxia: What It Is, Causes, Symptoms, Treatment & Types |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17748-ataxia |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Cleveland Clinic |language=en}}</ref>

=== Focal lesions ===
Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]], inflammatory [such as [[sarcoidosis]]], and "chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome" [CLIPPERS<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maenhoudt W, Ramboer K, Maqueda V | title = A Rare Cause of Dizziness and Gait Ataxia: CLIPPERS Syndrome | journal = Journal of the Belgian Society of Radiology | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 30151443 | pmc = 6102946 | doi = 10.5334/jbr-btr.997 | doi-access = free }}</ref>]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===
[[Exogenous]] substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Chronic intake of [[ethanol]] causes atrophy of the [[cerebellum]] by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses induced by [[thiamine]] deficiency.<ref name="pmid34444449">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitoma H, Manto M, Shaikh AG | title = Mechanisms of Ethanol-Induced Cerebellar Ataxia: Underpinnings of Neuronal Death in the Cerebellum | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 16 | pages = 8678 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34444449 | pmc = 8391842 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph18168678 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[synthetic cannabinoid]] [[Dexanabinol|HU-211]] ingestion<ref name="Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title=Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |access-date=3 September 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211253/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> and various other medical and recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses).

=== Hereditary ataxias ===
Ataxia may depend on [[hereditary]] disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating),autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-14<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sait H, Moirangthem A, Agrawal V, Phadke SR | title = Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-20 due to a novel SNX14 variant in an Indian girl | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

== Diagnosis ==
* Imaging studies - A <abbr>CT</abbr> scan or <abbr>MRI</abbr> of the brain might help determine potential causes. An <abbr>MRI</abbr> can sometimes show shrinkage of the cerebellum and other brain structures in people with ataxia. It may also show other treatable findings, such as a blood clot or benign tumour, that could be pressing on the cerebellum.
* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) - A needle is inserted into the lower back (lumbar region) between two lumbar vertebrae to obtain a sample of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] for testing.
* [[Genetic testing]] - Determines whether the mutation that causes one of the hereditary ataxic conditions is present. Tests are available for many but not all of the hereditary ataxias.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely.

Current research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a [[mobility aid]], physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and [[contracture]] prevention. Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes. These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living. While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain.<ref name="Intensive coordinative training improves motor performance in degenerative cerebellar disease"/>

== Other uses ==
The term "ataxia" is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include '''optic ataxia''' (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and [[ataxic respiration]] (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the [[medulla oblongata]]).

Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the [[posterior parietal cortex]], which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of [[Balint's syndrome]], but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.<ref name="pmid17603404">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallar G | title = Spatial neglect, Balint-Homes' and Gerstmann's syndrome, and other spatial disorders | journal = CNS Spectrums | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 527–536 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17603404 | doi = 10.1017/S1092852900021271 | s2cid = 45201083 }}</ref>
