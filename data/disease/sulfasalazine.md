==Medical uses==
Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]], including [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]].

==Side effects==
Use of sulfasalazine is contraindicated in people with [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa allergies]] and in those with [[urinary tract obstruction]]s, [[Bowel obstruction|intestinal obstructions]], and severe [[Liver disease|liver]] or [[Kidney failure|kidney problems]].<ref name=Dav2014 />

Sulfasalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/L are associated with side effects. In rare cases, sulfasalazine can cause severe [[depression (mood)|depression]] in young males. It can also cause oligospermia and temporary [[infertility]]. Immune [[thrombocytopenia]] has been reported.<ref name="pmid17551063">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantarini L, Tinazzi I, Biasi D, Fioravanti A, Galeazzi M | title = Sulfasalazine-induced immune thrombocytopenia | journal = Postgraduate Medical Journal | volume = 83 | issue = 980 | pages = e1 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17551063 | pmc = 2600053 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.2006.055194 }}</ref>

Sulfasalazine may cause [[sulfhemoglobinemia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Pharmacology==
Around 90% of a dose of sulfasalazine reaches the colon, where most of it is metabolized by bacteria into [[sulfapyridine]] and [[mesalazine]] (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA). Both metabolites are active; most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed and then further metabolized, but most mesalazine is not, and remains in the colon.<ref name=UKlabel2014/>

A mix of unchanged, hydroxylated, and glucuronidated sulfapyridine is eliminated in urine, as is acetylated mesalazine and unmetabolized sulfasalazine.<ref name=UKlabel2014/><ref name="UK sulfasalazine label" />

The mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears that sulfasalazine and its metabolites have [[immunosuppressive]], antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects.<ref name=USlabel2014/><ref name=UKlabel2014/>  It also appears to inhibit the [[cystine]]-[[Glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]] [[antiporter]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bridges RJ, Natale NR, Patel SA | title = System xc⁻ cystine/glutamate antiporter: an update on molecular pharmacology and roles within the CNS | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 165 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–34 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21564084 | pmc = 3252963 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01480.x }}</ref> as well as [[sepiapterin reductase]].<ref name="pmid22178186">{{cite journal | vauthors = Costigan M, Latremoliere A, Woolf CJ | title = Analgesia by inhibiting tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 92–99 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22178186 | pmc = 3288148 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2011.10.019 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
It is a [[codrug]] which is a combination of [[sulfapyridine]] and [[5-aminosalicylic acid]] coupled with an azo linkage.

==Cost==
In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of sulfasalazine is improved by combining it with other drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benucci M, Saviola G, Manfredi M, Sarzi-Puttini P, Atzeni F | title = Cost effectiveness analysis of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis.
