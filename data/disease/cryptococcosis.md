Cryptococcus is generally classified according to how it is acquired and its site.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pathogens|doi=10.3390/pathogens11070783 |doi-access=free |title=Elevated Intracranial Pressure in Cryptococcal Meningoencephalitis: Examining Old, New, and Promising Drug Therapies |date=July 2022 |volume=11 |issue=7 |page=783 |last1=Alanazi |first1=Abdulaziz H. |last2=Adil |first2=Mir S. |last3=Lin |first3=Xiaorong |last4=Chastain |first4=Daniel B. |last5=Henao-Martínez |first5=Andrés F. |last6=Franco-Paredes |first6=Carlos |last7=Somanath |first7=Payaningal R. |pmid=35890028 |pmc=9321092 }}</ref> It typically begins in the lungs before spreading to other parts of the body, particularly the brain and nervous system.<ref name=NORD/> The skin type is less common.<ref name=NORD/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected, appearing like a pneumonia.<ref name=CDCSymp/> There may also be [[fatigue|feeling of tiredness]].<ref name=ICD-11/> When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity, confusion or changes in behaviour.<ref name=CDCSymp/> It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, eyes, bones and prostate.<ref name=Maziarz2016/> In the skin, it may appear as several fluid-filled [[nodule (medicine)|nodules]] with [[necrosis|dead tissue]].<ref name=John2017/> Depending on the site of infection, other features may include [[Visual impairment|loss of vision]], [[diplopia|blurred vision]], inability to move an eye and memory loss.<ref name=Maziarz2016/>

Symptom onset is often sudden when lungs are infected and gradual over several weeks when the central nervous system is affected.<ref name=Maziarz2016/>

== Cause ==
Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection for [[AIDS]], and is particularly common among people living with AIDS in [[Africa]]. Other conditions that pose an increased risk include certain [[malignancy|malignancies]] (such as [[lymphoma]]), liver [[cirrhosis]], [[organ transplant]]s, and long-term [[corticosteroid]] therapy.<ref name="setianingrum-2019">{{cite journal

In humans, ''C.&nbsp;neoformans'' chiefly infects the skin, lungs, and central nervous system (causing [[meningitis]]).<ref name="gushiken-2021"/> Less commonly it may affect other organs such as the eye or prostate.<ref name="gushiken-2021"/>

== Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis ==
Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) is a distinct clinical diagnosis separate from the secondary cutaneous cryptococcosis that is spread from systematic infection. Males are more likely to develop the infection and a 2020 study showed that the sex bias may be due to a growth hormone, produced by ''C.&nbsp;neoformans'' called gibberellic acid (GA) that is upregulated by testosterone.<ref>Tucker JS, Guess TE, McClelland EE. The Role of Testosterone and Gibberellic Acid in the Melanization of ''Cryptococcus neoformans''. Front. Microbiol. 2020 Aug 13;11:1921. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01921. PMID 32922377; PMCID: PMC7456850.</ref>  The upper limbs account for a majority of infections. Isolates found in PCC include ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' (most common), ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus laurentii]]''. Prognosis for PCC is generally good outside of disseminated infection.<ref>Du L, Yang Y, Gu J, Chen J, Liao W, Zhu Y.

PMID 25736173.</ref>

Morphologic description of the lesions show umbilicated papules, nodules, and violaceous plaques that can mimic other cutaneous diseases like [[molluscum contagiosum]] and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. These lesions may be present months before other signs of system infection in patients with AIDS.<ref>Murakawa GJ, Kerschmann R, Berger T. Cutaneous Cryptococcus infection and AIDS.

Pulmonary cryptococcosis has a worldwide distribution and is commonly underdiagnosed due to limitations in diagnostic capabilities. Since pulmonary nodules are its most common radiological feature, it can clinically and radiologically mimic lung cancer, TB, and other pulmonary mycoses. The sensitivity of cultures and the Cryptococcal (CrAg) antigen with lateral flow device on serum are rarely positive in the absence of disseminated disease.<ref name="Setianingrum F" /> Moreover, pulmonary cryptococcosis worsen the prognosis of cryptococcal meningitis.<ref name="Setianingrum F" />

== Cryptococcal meningitis ==
[[Image:Meningitis criptocócica diseminada.png|thumb|250px|Disseminated cryptococcal meningitis]]
{{See also|Chronic meningitis}}
Cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the [[meninges]], the tissue covering the brain) is believed to result from dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or unappreciated pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. People with defects in their [[cell-mediated immunity]], for example, people with [[AIDS]], are especially susceptible to disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is often fatal, even if treated.  It is estimated that the three-month [[case-fatality rate]] is 9% in high-income regions, 55% in low/middle-income regions, and 70% in sub-Saharan Africa.  As of 2009 there were globally approximately 958,000 annual cases and 625,000 deaths within three months after infection.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Estimation of the current global burden of cryptococcal meningitis among persons living with HIV/AIDS|journal=AIDS|date=2009-02-20|volume=23|issue=4|pages=525–30|doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e328322ffac|vauthors=Park BJ, Wannemuehler KA, Marston BJ, Govender N, Pappas PG, Chiller TM |pmid=19182676|s2cid=5735550|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Cryptococcosis is also seen in cats and occasionally dogs. It is the most common deep fungal disease in cats, usually leading to chronic infection of the nose and sinuses, and skin ulcers. Cats may develop a bump over the bridge of the nose from local tissue inflammation. It can be associated with [[FeLV]] infection in cats. Cryptococcosis is most common in dogs and cats but cattle, sheep, goats, horses, wild animals, and birds can also be infected. Soil, fowl manure, and [[pigeon]] droppings are among the sources of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathealth.com/FungalINFXdeep.htm|title=Deep Fungal Infections|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413225853/http://www.cathealth.com/FungalINFXdeep.htm|archive-date=2010-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6653&O=Generic|title=Feline Cryptococcosis – WSAVA 2003 Congress – VIN|website=Vin.com|date=July 2014|last1=Akira Takeuchi|first1=D.
