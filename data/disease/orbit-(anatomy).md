In [[anatomy]], the '''orbit''' is the [[Body cavity|cavity]] or socket/hole of the [[skull]] in which the [[eye]] and [[Accessory visual structures|its appendages]] are situated. "Orbit" can refer to the bony socket,<ref name="urlOrbit – Definition and More from the Free Merriam–Webster Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orbit |title=Orbit – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |access-date=2010-03-26}}</ref> or it can also be used to imply the contents.<ref>{{MeSH name|Orbit}}</ref> In the adult human, the volume of the orbit is {{Convert|30|ml|2}}, of which the eye occupies {{Convert|6.5|ml|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=Duane's Ophthalmology |chapter=Embryology and Anatomy of the Orbit and Lacrimal System |editor-last=Tasman |editor-first=W. |editor2-last=Jaeger |editor2-first=E.

== Structure ==
[[File:Orbit of the Face, STL file processed 1.0.0.stl|thumb|3D model of orbit with surrounding bones]]
The orbits are conical or four-sided pyramidal cavities, which open into the midline of the face and point back into the head. Each consists of a base, an apex and four walls.<ref name="ReferenceA">"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009</ref>

===Openings===
There are two important [[foramen|foramina]], or windows, two important [[fissure (anatomy)|fissure]]s, or grooves, and one [[Canal (anatomy)|canal]] surrounding the [[Globe (human eye)|globe]] in the orbit. There is a [[supraorbital foramen]], an [[infraorbital foramen]], a [[superior orbital fissure]], an [[inferior orbital fissure]] and the [[optic canal]], each of which contains structures that are crucial to normal eye functioning. The supraorbital foramen contains the supraorbital nerve, the first division of the [[trigeminal nerve]] or V1 and lies just lateral to the [[frontal sinus]]. The infraorbital foramen contains the second division of the trigeminal nerve, the [[infraorbital nerve]] or V2, and sits on the anterior wall of the [[maxillary sinus]]. Both foramina are crucial as potential pathways for cancer and infections of the orbit to spread [[intracranial|into the brain]] or other deep facial structures.

The [[optic canal]] contains the ([[cranial nerve II]]) and the [[ophthalmic artery]], and sits at the junction of the sphenoid sinus with the [[ethmoidal sinus|ethmoid air cells]], superomedial and [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] to structures at the orbital apex. It provides a pathway between the orbital contents and the [[middle cranial fossa]]. The superior orbital fissure lies just [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] and [[inferior (anatomy)|inferior]] to the optic canal, and is formed at the junction of the [[lesser wing of sphenoid bone|lesser]] and [[Greater wing of sphenoid bone|greater wing]] of the [[sphenoid bone]]. It is a major pathway for intracranial communication, containing cranial nerves [[oculomotor nerve|III]], [[trochlear nerve|IV]], [[abducens nerve|VI]] which control eye movement via the [[extraocular muscles]], and the ophthalmic branches of [[trigeminal nerve|cranial nerve V]], or V1. The second division of the trigeminal nerve enters the skull base at the [[foramen rotundum]], or V2. The inferior orbital fissure lies inferior and lateral to the ocular globe at the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. It is not as important in function, though it does contain a few branches of the maxillary nerve and the infraorbital artery and vein.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=25804299|year=2015|last1=Mehta|first1=M.

D.|doi=10.3109/01676830.2014.997394|s2cid=43317074}}</ref> Other minor structures in the orbit include the [[Anterior ethmoidal foramen|anterior]] and [[posterior ethmoidal foramen]] and [[zygomatic orbital foramen]].

===Bony walls===
[[File:Orbital bones.png|275px|thumb|left|The seven bones that form the orbit:<br />yellow = [[Frontal bone]]<br />green = [[Lacrimal bone]]<br />brown = [[Ethmoid bone]]<br />blue = [[Zygomatic bone]]<br />purple = [[Maxillary bone]]<br />aqua = [[Palatine bone]]<br />red = [[Sphenoid bone]]<br /><br />teal = [[Nasal bone]] (illustrated but not part of the orbit)]]
The bony walls of the orbital canal in humans do not derive from a single bone, but a mosaic of seven [[embryology|embryologically]] distinct structures: the [[zygomatic bone]] [[lateral (anatomy)|laterally]], the [[sphenoid bone]], with its lesser wing forming the optic canal and its greater wing forming the lateral posterior portion of the bony orbital process, the [[maxillary bone]] [[inferior (anatomy)|inferiorly]] and [[medial (anatomy)|medially]] which, along with the [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]] and [[ethmoid bone]]s, forms the medial wall of the [[orbital canal]]. The ethmoid air cells are extremely thin, and form a structure known as the [[orbital lamina of ethmoid bone|lamina papyracea]], the most delicate bony structure in the skull, and one of the most commonly fractured bones in orbital trauma. The lacrimal bone also contains the [[nasolacrimal duct]]. The superior bony margin of the orbital rim, otherwise known as the [[orbital process]], is formed by the frontal bone.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=25665284|year=2014|last1=Bertelli|first1=E|title=Branching of the foramen rotundum. A rare variation of the sphenoid|journal=Italian Journal of Anatomy and Embryology |volume=119|issue=2|pages=148–53|last2=Regoli|first2=M}}</ref>

The roof (superior wall) is formed primarily by the orbital plate [[frontal bone]], and also the lesser wing of [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] near the apex of the orbit. The orbital surface presents medially by trochlear fovea and laterally by lacrimal fossa.<ref name="Moore 2010">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith L.|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy |edition=6th |year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-07817-7525-0}}</ref>

The floor (inferior wall) is formed by the orbital surface of [[maxilla]], the orbital surface of [[zygomatic bone]] and the minute orbital process of [[palatine bone]]. Medially, near the orbital margin, is located the groove for [[nasolacrimal duct]]. Near the middle of the floor, located infraorbital groove, which leads to the infraorbital foramen. The floor is separated from the lateral wall by [[inferior orbital fissure]], which connects the orbit to [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]] and [[infratemporal fossa]].

The medial wall is formed primarily by the orbital plate of [[ethmoid]], as well as contributions from the frontal process of maxilla, the [[lacrimal bone]], and a small part of the body of the sphenoid. It is the thinnest wall of the orbit, evidenced by pneumatized ethmoidal cells.<ref name="Moore 2010"/>

The lateral wall is formed by the frontal process of zygomatic and more posteriorly by the orbital plate of the greater wing of sphenoid. The bones meet at the zygomaticosphenoid suture. The lateral wall is the thickest wall of the orbit, important because it is the most exposed surface, highly vulnerable to blunt force trauma.

===Borders===
The base, orbital margin, which opens in the face, has four borders. The following bones take part in their formation:
# Superior margin: [[frontal bone]]
# Inferior margin: [[maxilla]] and [[zygomatic bone]]
# Medial margin: [[frontal bone]] and [[maxilla]]
# Lateral margin: [[zygomatic bone]] and [[frontal bone]]

==Function==
The orbit holds and protects the [[eye]]s.

===Eye movement===
{{main|Eye movement}}
The movement of the eye is controlled by six distinct extraocular muscles, a [[superior rectus|superior]], an [[inferior rectus|inferior]], a [[medial rectus|medial]] and a [[lateral rectus|lateral]] rectus, as well as a [[superior oblique muscle|superior]] and an [[inferior oblique]]. The superior ophthalmic vein is a sigmoidal vessel along the superior margin of the orbital canal that drains deoxygenated blood from surrounding musculature. The [[ophthalmic artery]] is a crucial structure in the orbit, as it is often the only source of collateral blood to the brain in cases of large [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid]] [[stroke|infarcts]], as it is a collateral pathway to the [[circle of Willis]]. In addition, there is the [[optic canal]], which contains the optic nerve, or cranial nerve II, and is formed entirely by the lesser wing of the sphenoid, separated from the supraorbital fissure by the [[optic strut]]. Injury to any one of these structures by infection, trauma or neoplasm can cause temporary or permanent visual dysfunction, and even blindness if not promptly corrected.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=25992806|year=2015|last1=Ference|first1=E. H.|title=Surgical anatomy and variations of the infraorbital nerve|journal=The Laryngoscope|volume=125|issue=6|pages=1296–300|last2=Smith|first2=S. S.|last3=Conley|first3=D|last4=Chandra|first4=R. K.|doi=10.1002/lary.25089|s2cid=5567574}}</ref> The orbits also protect the eye from mechanical injury.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Clinical significance==
In the orbit, the surrounding fascia allows for smooth rotation and protects the orbital contents. If excessive tissue accumulates behind the ocular globe, the eye can protrude, or become [[exophthalmos|exophthalmic]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

[[Image:Tear system.svg|150px|right|thumb|'''Tear system''':<br />a. tear gland / lacrimal gland,<br />b. superior lacrimal punctum,<br />c. superior lacrimal canal,<br />d. tear sac / lacrimal sac,<br />e. inferior lacrimal punctum,<br />f. inferior lacrimal canal,<br />g. nasolacrimal canal]]Enlargement of the [[lacrimal gland]], located superotemporally within the orbit, produces protrusion of the eye inferiorly and medially (away from the location of the lacrimal gland). Lacrimal gland may be enlarged from [[inflammation]] (e.g. [[Sarcoidosis|sarcoid]]) or [[neoplasm]] (e.g. [[lymphoma]] or [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=V. |last2=Abbas |first2=A.

Tumors (e.g. [[glioma]] and [[meningioma]] of the [[optic nerve]]) within the cone formed by the horizontal rectus muscles produce axial protrusion (bulging forward) of the eye.

[[Graves disease]] may also cause axial protrusion of the eye, known as [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], due to buildup of [[extracellular matrix]] [[protein]]s and [[fibrosis]] in the rectus muscles. Development of Graves' ophthalmopathy may be independent of thyroid function.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hatton |first1=M. P. |last2=Rubin |first2=P.
