A '''pericardial cyst''' is an uncommon benign dilatation of the [[Pericardium|pericardial sac]] surrounding the heart. It can lead to symptoms by compressing nearby structures, but is usually asymptomatic.<ref name=":02">{{Citation|last1=Meredith|first1=Amanda|title=Pericardial Cyst|date=2021|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562287/|work=StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=32965958|access-date=2021-12-28|last2=Zazai|first2=Ibrahim K.|last3=Kyriakopoulos|first3=Chris}}</ref> Pericardial cysts can be congenital or acquired, and they are typically diagnosed with radiologic imaging.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19">{{Cite journal|last1=Kar|first1=Sandeep Kumar|last2=Ganguly|first2=Tanmoy|date=2017|title=Current concepts of diagnosis and management of pericardial cysts|journal=Indian Heart Journal|volume=69|issue=3|pages=364–370|doi=10.1016/j.ihj.2017.02.021|issn=0019-4832|pmc=5485391|pmid=28648435}}</ref><ref name=":28">{{Cite journal|last1=Khayata|first1=Mohamed|last2=Alkharabsheh|first2=Saqer|last3=Shah|first3=Nishant P.|last4=Klein|first4=Allan L.|date=2019-05-30|title=Pericardial Cysts: a Contemporary Comprehensive Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-019-1153-5|journal=Current Cardiology Reports|language=en|volume=21|issue=7|pages=64|doi=10.1007/s11886-019-1153-5|pmid=31147788|s2cid=171094420|issn=1534-3170}}</ref> Management of pericardial cysts can include follow-up imaging, percutaneous aspiration, or surgical resection.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" />

==Presentation==
Pericardial cysts most often are [[asymptomatic]], with 50 to 75% of patients experiencing no symptoms.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /> The presentation of symptomatic cysts depends on the cyst location and effects on nearby structures, including the heart, lungs, and esophagus.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Symptoms can include chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, [[palpitations]], [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], recurrent [[pneumonia]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]], difficulty swallowing, and weight loss.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" />

== Causes ==
Pericardial cysts can be [[Birth defect|congenital]] or acquired, with the majority being congenital.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Congenital pericardial cysts happen due to an abnormality in the development of the [[pericardial sac]] that creates a bulge which is walled off to form a cyst.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":28" /> Acquired pericardial cysts can be caused by inflammation from surgery, [[pericarditis]], trauma, [[echinococcosis]], [[tuberculosis]], [[metastasis]], or [[hemodialysis]].<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" />  The inflammation can lead to a walled-off pocket of fluid that is a pericardial cyst.<ref name=":28" />

== Diagnosis ==
Since pericardial cysts are often asymptomatic, the most common diagnosis is through [[Incidental medical findings|incidental finding]] on a chest x-ray.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /> Differentiation of pericardial cysts from [[Diverticulum|diverticula]] is usually impossible as both the lesions have similar radiological appearance. The lone differentiating feature is the presence of communicating tract between pericardium and the cyst cavity in the diverticula, unlike the fully walled off pericardial cyst.<ref name=":32" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=ClinicalKey |url=https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S001948321630164X?scrollTo=#tbl0015 |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=www.clinicalkey.com}}</ref> When patients have symptoms, [[transthoracic echocardiogram]] is one of the first tests used to look for a pericardial cyst.<ref name=":28" /> [[CT scan|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] may also be used to diagnose pericardial cysts.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal|last1=Oyama|first1=Noriko|last2=Oyama|first2=Naotsugu|last3=Komuro|first3=Kaoru|last4=Nambu|first4=Toshikazu|last5=Manning|first5=Warren J.|last6=Miyasaka|first6=Kazuo|date=2004|title=Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Pericardium: Anatomy and Pathology|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mrms/3/3/3_3_145/_article|journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medical Sciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=145–152|doi=10.2463/mrms.3.145|pmid=16093632|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":42">{{Cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Jin Wang|last2=Jeong|first2=Won Gi|last3=Lee|first3=Jong Eun|last4=Lee|first4=Hyo-jae|last5=Ki|first5=So Yeon|last6=Lee|first6=Byung Chan|last7=Kim|first7=Hyoung Ook|last8=Kim|first8=Seul Kee|last9=Heo|first9=Suk Hee|last10=Lim|first10=Hyo Soon|last11=Shin|first11=Sang Soo|date=2021|title=Pictorial Review of Mediastinal Masses with an Emphasis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging|journal=Korean Journal of Radiology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=139–154|doi=10.3348/kjr.2019.0897|issn=1229-6929|pmc=7772375|pmid=32783412}}</ref><ref name=":52">{{Cite journal|last1=Peebles|first1=C R|last2=Shambrook|first2=J S|last3=Harden|first3=S P|date=2011|title=Pericardial disease—anatomy and function|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|volume=84|issue=Spec Iss 3|pages=S324–S337|doi=10.1259/bjr/16168253|issn=0007-1285|pmc=3473919|pmid=22723538}}</ref> On CT and MRI a pericardial cyst will commonly appear as a round, fluid-filled structure surrounded by thin walls.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":42" /><ref name=":52" /> Diagnosis of a pericardial cyst can also be made before birth using ultrasound.<ref name=":19" /> 

The differential diagnosis for a suspected pericardial cyst includes a [[Branchial cleft cyst|bronchial cyst]], [[pericardial effusion]], [[teratoma]], [[lymphangioma]], pericardial fat, [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]], [[Neurenteric canal|neuroenteric]] cyst, and congenital cyst from the primitive [[foregut]].<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> 

== Management ==
Pericardial cysts that are small and cause no symptoms can be followed with repeat imaging through [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]], CT, or MRI to assess for changes.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /> Pericardial cysts that are large or cause symptoms may be candidates for percutaneous aspiration, ethanol sclerosis, or surgery.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Percutaneous aspiration removes the fluid from inside the cyst, and ethanol sclerosis uses the injection of ethanol into the cyst after aspiration to decrease the likelihood of cyst recurrence.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Percutaneous aspiration with ethanol sclerosis is typically the first treatment for pericardial cyst that requires management.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Surgery can remove a pericardial cyst through a [[thoracotomy]], [[Median sternotomy|sternotomy]], [[mediastinoscopy]], or [[Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery|video-assisted thoracic surgery]].<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" /> The type of surgery is chosen based on the size and location of the pericardial cyst.<ref name=":19" />

== Prognosis ==
With most pericardial cysts having no symptoms, the prognosis is very good.<ref name=":02" /> The cysts can resolve without intervention.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":28" /> If percutaneous aspiration is performed, the recurrence rate of pericardial cysts is about 30-33%.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":28" /> Although pericardial cysts are benign, the location of cysts can rarely cause life-threatening emergencies by compressing the heart or lungs.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":19" />

== Epidemiology ==
Pericardial cysts have an incidence of 1 in 100,000.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":52" /> Pericardial cysts make up 6-7% of all [[Mediastinum|mediastinal]] masses.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> They can present at any age, but are most commonly diagnosed between the third and fifth decade of life.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":28" /> Females and males have approximately equal incidences of pericardial cysts.<ref name=":19" />

== History ==
Pericardial cysts were first reported on during [[Autopsy|autopsies]] in the 19th century by pathologists.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":62">{{Cite journal|last1=Schweigert|first1=Michael|last2=Dubecz|first2=Attila|last3=Beron|first3=Martin|last4=Ofner|first4=Dietmar|last5=Stein|first5=Hubert J.|date=2012|title=The Tale of Spring Water Cysts|journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal|volume=39|issue=3|pages=330–334|issn=0730-2347|pmc=3368475|pmid=22719140}}</ref> As the field of [[radiology]] progressed, pericardial cysts could be identified in living patients.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":62" /> In 1931, the first surgical resection of a pericardial cyst was performed by Otto Pickhardt at [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] in New York using a [[thoracoscopy]].<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":62" /> In 1943, Greenfield and his colleagues coined the term "spring water cysts" for pericardial cysts since the cysts contain clear fluid.<ref name=":19" /><ref name=":62" />
