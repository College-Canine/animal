<!-- Definition and symptoms -->

'''Lead poisoning''', also known as '''plumbism''' and '''saturnism''', is a type of [[metal poisoning]] caused by [[lead]] in the body.<ref name=WHO2016/> Symptoms may include abdominal pain, [[constipation]], headaches, irritability, memory problems, [[infertility]], and [[paresthesia|tingling]] in the hands and feet.<ref name=CDC2013Sym>{{cite web|title=Lead Information for Workers |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html |website=CDC|access-date=14 October 2016|date=30 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215410/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html|archive-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> It causes almost 10% of [[intellectual disability]] of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems.<ref name=WHO2016/> Some of the effects are permanent.<ref name=WHO2016/> In severe cases, [[anemia]], [[seizures]], [[coma]], or [[death]] may occur.<ref name=CDC2013Sym/><ref name=WHO2016/>

<!-- Exposure and diagnosis -->
Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products.<ref name=WHO2016/> Lead poisoning poses a significantly increased risk to children as they are far more likely to ingest lead indirectly by chewing on toys or other objects that are coated in [[lead paint]].<ref name=WHO2016/> The amount of lead that can be absorbed by children is also higher than that of adults. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk.<ref name=Gra2007/> Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the [[blood lead level]].<ref name=WHO2016>{{cite web|title=Lead poisoning and health|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/|website=WHO|access-date=14 October 2016|date=September 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018024720/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/|archive-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10&nbsp;μg/dL (10&nbsp;μg/100 g) and for children at 3.5&nbsp;μg/dL,<ref name=CDC2021>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1028-blood-lead.html |title=CDC Updates Blood Lead Reference Value for Children |website=CDC  |date=28 October 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922075339/https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1028-blood-lead.html |archive-date= Sep 22, 2023 }}</ref> previously before October 2021 5&nbsp;μg/dL<ref name="CDC2012">{{cite web|date=2021-10-28|title=Blood Lead Reference Value {{!}} Lead |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/data/blood-lead-reference-value.htm|access-date=2021-12-01|website=CDC |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America|date=2005|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb06AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA116|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194927/https://books.google.com/books?id=sb06AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA116|archive-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in [[red blood cell]]s or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on [[X-ray]].<ref name=Dap2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dapul H, Laraque D | title = Lead poisoning in children | journal = Advances in Pediatrics | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 313–33 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25037135 | doi = 10.1016/j.yapd.2014.04.004 }}</ref>

<!-- Epidemiology and history -->
In 2013, lead is believed to have resulted in 853,000 deaths worldwide.<ref name=WHO2016/> It occurs most commonly in the [[developing world]].<ref name=WHO2016/> There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the [[Flint water crisis]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America |title=Thousands of US Cities Have Worse Lead Problems Than Flint |date=11 February 2017 |url=https://www.lhsfna.org/index.cfm/lifelines/february-2017/thousands-of-u-s-cities-have-worse-lead-problems-than-flint/ |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref> Those who are poor are at greater risk.<ref name=WHO2016/> Lead is believed to result in 0.6% of the world's [[disease burden]].<ref name=Need2004/> According to a study, half of the US population has been exposed to substantially detrimental lead levels in early childhood – mainly from car exhaust, from which lead pollution peaked in the 1970s and caused widespread loss in cognitive ability.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lead exposure in last century shrunk IQ scores of half of Americans |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-03-exposure-century-shrunk-iq-scores.html |access-date=18 April 2022 |work=Duke University |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=McFarland |first1=Michael J. |last2=Hauer |first2=Matt E. |last3=Reuben |first3=Aaron |title=Half of US population exposed to adverse lead levels in early childhood |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=15 March 2022 |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=e2118631119 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2118631119|doi-access=free | pmid=35254913  |pmc=8931364 |bibcode=2022PNAS..11918631M |language=en |issn=0027-8424}}</ref>{{Globalize-inline|date=April 2022}}

==Classification==
<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
Classically, "lead poisoning" or "lead intoxication" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects.<ref name="Grant09-785">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 785</ref> Poisoning is a pattern of symptoms that occur with toxic effects from mid to high levels of exposure; toxicity is a wider spectrum of effects, including [[subclinical]] ones (those that do not cause symptoms).<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guidotti TL, Ragain L | title = Protecting children from toxic exposure: three strategies | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–35, vii | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17448358 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.533.907 }}</ref> However, professionals often use "lead poisoning" and "lead toxicity" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of "lead poisoning" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead.<ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/>

The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity.<ref name="Pearson03"/>
<!-- ACUTE VS. CHRONIC -->
Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common.<ref name="Trevor07-479">[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] p. 479</ref>
<!-- BLOOD LEVELS -->
Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in [[microgram]]s of lead per [[deciliter]] of blood (μg/dL). Urine lead levels may be used as well, though less commonly. In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. If a provider is performing a provocative excretion test, or "chelation challenge", a measurement obtained from urine rather than blood is likely to provide a more accurate representation of total lead burden to a skilled interpreter.<ref name="who.int">{{cite web | last = Lowry | first = Jennifer A. | date = 2010 | url =https://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/18/applications/4_2_LeadOralChelators.pdf | title = Oral Chelation Therapy for Patients with Lead Poisoning | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126141333/http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/18/applications/4_2_LeadOralChelators.pdf | archive-date = 2016-01-26 | work = WHO}}</ref>

The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that a blood lead level of 10&nbsp;μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level.<ref name="Rossi09"/><ref name="Barbosa">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbosa F, Tanus-Santos JE, Gerlach RF, Parsons PJ | title = A critical review of biomarkers used for monitoring human exposure to lead: advantages, limitations, and future needs | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 12 | pages = 1669–74 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16330345 | pmc = 1314903 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7917 }}</ref> Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/>

<!-- ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC -->
Lead forms a variety of compounds and exists in the environment in various forms.<ref name="Grant09-761">[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 761</ref> Features of poisoning differ depending on whether the agent is an [[organic compound]] (one that contains carbon), or an [[inorganic]] one.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic [[gasoline#Tetraethyl lead|lead compounds as gasoline additives]], but such compounds are still used in industrial settings.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the [[central nervous system]] predominantly.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of lead poisoning (raster).png|thumb|upright=1.3|Symptoms of lead poisoning]]
<!-- ABOUT S/S -->
Lead poisoning can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign|signs]] which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure.<ref name="Karri08"/><ref name="Kosnett05-825"/> Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms.<ref name="Mycyk05-463"/> Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.<ref name="Dart041426"/>
<!-- ORGANIC LEAD -->
Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly.<ref name="Timbrell08">{{cite book |title= Principles of Biochemical Toxicology |edition=4th |chapter=Biochemical mechanisms of toxicity: Specific examples | veditors = Timbrell JA |year= 2008 |publisher=Informa Health Care |isbn= 978-0-8493-7302-2}}</ref> Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as [[insomnia]], [[delirium]], [[cognitive deficit]]s, [[tremor]], [[hallucinations]], and convulsions.<ref name="Katzung07-948"/>

<!--
CHILDREN V. ADULTS-->
Symptoms may be different in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, [[abdominal pain]], [[memory loss]], [[kidney failure]], male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce JM | title = Burton's line in lead poisoning | journal = European Neurology | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 118–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17179719 | doi = 10.1159/000098100 | s2cid = 41427430 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Early symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].<ref name="Merrill07"/> Other early signs in adults include [[malaise]], fatigue, decreased [[libido]], and problems with sleep.<ref name="Karri08"/> An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs.<ref name="Patrick06"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/17844517 |title=Childhood Lead Exposure, Adult Personality, and Later-Life Mental Health |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=3 September 2019 |website=AMA Ed Hub |publisher=JN Learning |access-date=13 December 2020 |quote=This JAMA Medical News video summarizes findings from a recent cohort study reporting an association between childhood lead exposure in Dunedin, New Zealand, and adult personality traits and psychopathology.}}</ref>

In adults, symptoms can occur at levels above 40&nbsp;μg/dL, but are more likely to occur only above 50–60&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Karri08"/> Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name=Need2004/> However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual.<ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/> At blood lead levels between 25 and 60&nbsp;μg/dL, [[neuropsychiatric]] effects such as delayed [[reaction time]]s, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed [[motor nerve]] conduction and headache can occur.<ref name="Kosnett06-240">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.240</ref> [[Anemia]] may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Merrill07"/> In adults, abdominal [[colic]], involving [[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysm]]s of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825">[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] p. 825</ref> Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100&nbsp;μg/dL include [[wrist drop]] and [[foot drop]], <!-- because of neuropathy --> and signs of [[encephalopathy]] (a condition characterized by [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]]), such as those that accompany increased [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], delirium, coma, [[seizures]], and [[headache]].<ref name="Henretig061314">[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] p. 1314</ref> In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Henretig061314"/> For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100&nbsp;μg/dL.<ref name="Kosnett05-825"/>

===Acute poisoning===
In acute poisoning, typical neurological signs are pain, muscle weakness, [[paresthesia|numbness and tingling]], and, rarely, symptoms associated with [[encephalitis|inflammation of the brain]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Lead's effects on the mouth include [[astringent|astringency]] and a metallic taste.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> [[Gastrointestinal problem]]s, such as [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[poor appetite]], or [[weight loss]], are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] (insufficient fluid in the [[circulatory system]]) due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> [[Hemolysis]] (the rupture of [[red blood cells]]) due to acute poisoning can cause [[anemia]] and [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as  acquired fanconi syndrome and [[oliguria|decreased urine output]].<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/>

===Chronic poisoning===
Chronic poisoning usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems,<ref name="Katzung07-948"/> but is associated with three main types of symptoms: [[gastrointestinal]], [[neuromuscular]], and [[neurological]].<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> [[Central nervous system]] and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods.<ref name="Brunton07-31"/> Signs of chronic exposure include loss of [[short-term memory]] or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities.<ref name="Patrick06"/>{{ums|date=December 2017}} Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> A "lead hue" of the skin with [[pallor]] and/or [[lividity]] is another feature<!--of chronic lead poisoning-->.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book | last1 = James | first1 = William | last2 = Berger | first2 = Timothy | last3 = Elston | first3 = Dirk | date = 2005 | title = Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology | edition = 10th | publisher = Saunders | isbn = 0-7216-2921-0 | page = 859}}</ref><ref name="El SafouryAbd El Fatah2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = El Safoury OS, El Fatah DS, Ibrahim M | title = Treatment of periocular hyperpigmentation due to lead of kohl (surma) by penicillamine: a single group non-randomized clinical trial | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–3 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20101339 | pmc = 2807714 | doi = 10.4103/0019-5154.57614 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a [[Burton line]], is another indication of chronic lead poisoning.<ref name="Rambousek08-177">[[#CITEREFRambousek08|Rambousek (2008)]] p.177</ref> Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have [[Hyperkinetic disorder|hyperkinetic]] or aggressive behavior disorders.<ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/> Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision as a result of central [[scotoma]], caused by toxic [[optic neuritis]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fintak|first1=David R. |title=Wills Eye Resident Case Series|date=30 January 2007|url=http://www.revophth.com/content/d/wills_resident_case_series/i/1297/c/24966/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181927/http://www.revophth.com/content/d/wills_resident_case_series/i/1297/c/24966/|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

=== Cannabis ===
In 2007, a mass poisoning due to adulterated [[marijuana]] was uncovered in Leipzig, Germany, where 29 young adults were hospitalized with lead poisoning for several months after having smoked marijuana that had been tainted with small lead particles. One hypothesis from the police was that lead, with its high specific gravity, was used to increase the weight of street marijuana sold by the gram, thereby maximizing the dealers' profits. The researchers estimated that the profit per kilogram increased by as much as $1,500 with the lead added. It is common for drugs to be cut with less-expensive substances to increase the profits of dealers or distributors (e.g., cocaine is routinely adulterated with sugars, talcum powder, magnesium salts, and even other drugs). It is thought that the adverse reactions to many of these drugs are a result of poor manufacturing rather than face-value overdoses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/Drugs/story?id=4622149|title=Lead-Tainted Marijuana Poisons Users|website=[[ABC News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Busse FP, Fiedler GM, Leichtle A, Hentschel H, Stumvoll M |title=Lead poisoning due to adulterated marijuana in leipzig |journal=Dtsch Ärztebl Int |volume=105 |issue=44 |pages=757–62 |date=October 2008 |pmid=19623274 |pmc=2696942 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2008.0757}}</ref>

Besides adulteration, [[cannabis]] plants have an inherent ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil. This makes them useful for remediating contaminated sites. But this may also make cannabis dangerous for consumers who ingest it. Some cannabis strains have been bred specifically to remove pollutants from soil, air or water, a method known as [[phytoremediation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/12/211216150039.htm|title=Cannabis may contain heavy metals and affect consumer health, study finds}}</ref>

Like Flint, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., a similar situation affects the state of Wisconsin, where estimates call for replacement of up to 176,000 underground pipes made of lead known as [[lead service line]]s. The City of [[Madison, Wisconsin]], addressed the issue and replaced all of their lead service lines, but there are still other cities that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, a permanent fix would be to replace the pipes completely.

Lead wheel weights have been found to accumulate on roads and interstates and erode in traffic entering the water runoff through drains. Leaded fishing weights accumulate in rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes.

=== Gasoline ===
[[Tetraethyllead]] was first added to gasoline in 1923, as it helped prevent [[engine knocking]]. Automotive exhaust represented a major way for lead to be inhaled, invade the bloodstream and pass into the brain.<ref>[https://today.duke.edu/2022/03/lead-exposure-last-century-shrunk-iq-scores-half-americans Lead Exposure in Last Century Shrank IQ Scores of Half of Americans]</ref>

The use of lead in gasoline peaked in the 1970s. By the next decade most high-income countries prohibited the use of leaded petrol. As late as 2002, almost all low- and middle-income countries, including some [[OECD]] members, still used it. The  [[UN Environment Programme]] (UNEP) thus launched a campaign in 2002 to eliminate its use, leading to Algeria being the last country to stop its use in July 2021.<ref>[https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/era-leaded-petrol-over-eliminating-major-threat-human-and-planetary Era of leaded petrol over, eliminating a major threat to human and planetary health]</ref>

===Enzymes===
[[File:196-Lead Poisoning-1qnv.tif|thumb|right|[[Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase|ALAD enzyme]] with lead bound ({{PDB|1QNV}})]]
The primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes.<ref name="Pearson03"/> Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act.<ref name="Dart041426"/> Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same [[enzyme]]s as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals which lead displaces in this way are calcium, iron, and zinc.<ref name="Kosnett06-238">[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.238</ref>

The lead ion has a [[lone pair]] in its electronic structure, which can result in a distortion in the [[Coordination complex|coordination]] of [[ligand]]s, and in 2007 was hypothesized to be important in lead poisoning's effects on enzymes (see {{section link|Lone pair|Unusual lone pairs}}).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gourlaouen C, Parisel O | title = Is an electronic shield at the molecular origin of lead poisoning?

CHELATION -->
[[File:Metal-EDTA.svg|thumb|left|EDTA, a [[Chelation|chelating agent]], binds a heavy metal, sequestering it.|alt=a chemical diagram of [CH2N(CH2CO2-)2]2 (shown in black) with the four O- tails binding a metal ion (shown in red).]]

<!--DEFINITION-->
A chelating agent is a molecule with at least two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead.<ref name="Trevor07-480">[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] p. 480</ref> The [[chelate]] that is thus formed is nontoxic<ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/> and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate.<ref name="Kosnett05-822">[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] p. 822</ref> The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium ([[Sodium calcium edetate|CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA]]), [[dimercaprol]] (BAL), which are injected, and [[Dimercaptosuccinic acid|succimer]] and d-[[penicillamine]], which are administered orally.<ref name="Menkes06">[[#CITEREFMenkes06|Menkes (2006)]] p.706</ref>

People receiving dimercaprol need to be assessed for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or [[2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid|DMPS]] prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system.<ref name=Flora2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flora SJ, Pachauri V | title = Chelation in metal intoxication | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 2745–88 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20717537 | pmc = 2922724 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph7072745 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes.<ref name=Flora2010/> An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25&nbsp;μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances.<ref name="Gra2007"/> It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.<ref name="Gra2007"/>

CHELATION CHALLENGE

Chelation challenge, also known as provocation testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/> This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/> Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee BK, Schwartz BS, Stewart W, Ahn KD | title = Provocative chelation with DMSA and EDTA: evidence for differential access to lead storage sites | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–9 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7697134 | pmc = 1128144 | doi = 10.1136/oem.52.1.13 }}</ref> Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial.<ref name="who.int"/><ref name="Katzung07-948"/> Although the technique has been used to determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/> The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.<ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/>

===Notable cases===
{{Main|Lead poisoning epidemics}}
Cases of mass lead poisoning can occur. In 2009, 15,000 people were planned to be relocated from [[Jiyuan]] in central [[Henan province]] to other locations after 1000 children living around China's largest smelter plant (owned and operated by Yuguang Gold and Lead) were found to have excess lead in their blood. The total cost of this project is estimated to around 1&nbsp;billion yuan ($150&nbsp;million). 70% of the cost was estimated to be paid by local government and the smelter company, while the rest would be paid by the residents themselves.

<!--ROMANS -->
Lead was used extensively in [[Roman aqueduct]]s from about 500&nbsp;BC to 300&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Gilbert06"/> [[Julius Caesar]]'s engineer, [[Vitruvius]], reported, "water is much more wholesome from [[earthenware]] pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because [[white lead]] is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body."<ref name="Prioreschi98">{{cite book |title= A History of Medicine, Volume 3 Of Roman Medicine | vauthors = Prioreschi P |year=1998 |publisher= Horatius Press |isbn= 978-1-888456-03-5 |page=279}}</ref> [[Gout]], prevalent in affluent Rome, is thought to be the result of lead, or leaded eating and drinking vessels.  Sugar of lead ([[lead(II) acetate]]) was used to sweeten wine, and the gout that resulted from this was known as "saturnine" gout.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Couper RT | title = The severe gout of Emperor Charles V | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 355 | issue = 18 | pages = 1935–6; author reply 1936 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17079773 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMc062352 }}</ref> It is even hypothesized that lead poisoning may have contributed to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]],<ref name="Need2004" /><ref name="Henretig06"/> a hypothesis thoroughly disputed:

{{blockquote|The great disadvantage of lead has always been that it is poisonous. This was fully recognised by the ancients, and Vitruvius specifically warns against its use. Because it was nevertheless used in profusion for carrying drinking water, the conclusion has often been drawn that the Romans must therefore have suffered from lead poisoning; sometimes conclusions are carried even further and it is inferred that this caused infertility and other unwelcome conditions, and that lead plumbing was largely responsible for the decline and fall of Rome.

Two things make this otherwise attractive hypothesis impossible. First, the [[calcium carbonate]] deposit that formed so thickly inside the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] channels also formed inside the pipes, effectively insulating the water from the lead, so that the two never touched. Second, because the Romans had so few [[faucet|taps]] and the water was constantly running, it was never inside the pipes for more than a few minutes, and certainly not long enough to become contaminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}</ref>}}

However, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.

Romans also consumed lead through the consumption of [[defrutum|''defrutum'', ''carenum'', and ''sapa'']], [[must]]s made by boiling down fruit in lead cookware. {{Lang|la|Defrutum}} and its relatives were used in [[ancient Roman cuisine]] and cosmetics, including as a [[food preservative]].<ref name="Brighton">{{cite video |title=Tales of the Living Dead: Poisoned Roman Babies |date=2004 |medium=television |publisher=Brighton TV for National Geographic |people=Director: Chris Warren}}</ref> The use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard and copper cookware was used far more generally. There is also no indication how often {{Lang|la|sapa}} was added or in what quantity.

In 1983, environmental chemist [[Jerome Nriagu]] argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning.<ref name="pmid6338384">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nriagu JO |date=March 1983 |title=Saturnine gout among Roman aristocrats.
