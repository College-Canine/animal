The '''Miniature Schnauzer''' is a [[dog breed|breed]] of small dog of the [[Schnauzer]] type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century.

==History==
The earliest records surrounding the development of the [[Standard Schnauzer]] in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property.<ref name="hillspets" /> As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it, according to [[cynology|cynologist]] theorization, with one or more small breeds such as the [[Affenpinscher]] and [[Miniature Poodle]],<ref name="KennelClub"/><ref name="hillspets">{{cite web |url=https://www.hillspet.com/dog-care/dog-breeds/miniature-schnauzer |title=Miniature Schnauzer |website=Hillspet.com |access-date=25 March 2013 |quote=Miniature Schnauzers are hardy, merry little dogs that were first bred in Germany in the late 19th century.

The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer in the United States is considered to have a beginning in 1924 when four dogs were imported from Germany. It is argued that almost all American-bred Miniatures partly descend from them, and between 1926 and 1936, 108 more dogs were imported. One of the most notable champions was [[Ch. Dorem Display]],<ref name="ddisplay">{{cite web |url=http://www.schnauzerweb.com/dorem_display.html |title=Dorem Display |work=SchnauzerWeb.com |access-date=28 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102235131/http://www.schnauzerweb.com/dorem_display.html |archive-date=2 November 2013}}</ref> born in 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen.<ref name="Magazine2011"/> It is claimed that many champion Miniature Schnauzers in America can trace their lineage back to Dorem Display.<ref name="Magazine2011"/><ref name="ddisplay"/>

Miniature Schnauzers are often described as non-[[moulting]] dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable. For this reason, Schnauzers are considered a [[hypoallergenic dog breed|hypoallergenic breed]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/got-allergies-15-hypoallergenic-dogs-and-cats/12/ |title=Got allergies? 15 hypoallergenic dogs and cats: Schnauzers |work=CBS News |date=31 March 2011 |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> They are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache, and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a "scissor bite"; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when [[Cropping (animal)|cropped]], the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be [[Docking (dog)|docked]] (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called "cat feet") with thick, black pads.<ref name="AKCMiniature"/><ref name="gopets">{{cite web |url=http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dogs/dogs-that-do-not-shed.aspx |title=Dogs That Do Not Shed |work=GoPetsAmerica.com |access-date=18 September 2008}}</ref>

Docking of tails and cropping of ears has become a controversial practice, especially for non-working dogs, and is now illegal or restricted in a number of countries worldwide, including the UK and Australia.<ref name="webmd-dockcrop">{{cite news |url=https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/features/ear-cropping-and-tail-docking |title=Ear Cropping and Tail Docking |work=[[WebMD]] |first1=Camille |last1=Pagan |first2=Amy |last2=Flowers |access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref>

===Grooming===
Schnauzers have a specific groom cut that is standard among the schnauzer breeds. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping, or by clipping. Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. When kept as pets, Miniature Schnauzers are often groomed differently (usually via clipping) from show dogs (often using stripping). Regular grooming of a Miniature Schnauzer is recommended approximately every six weeks.<ref name="Rugh1997">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZThdt_-_6EC&pg=PA70 |title=Miniature Schnauzers: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual |publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]] |first=Karla S. |last=Rugh |pages=70–74 |date=1997 |isbn=0-8120-9739-4}}</ref> Clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or [[Giant Schnauzer|Giants]], often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out.  Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.<ref name="amsc-grooming" />

===North American white coat controversy===
[[File:Цвергшнауцер белый.jpg|thumb|A white Miniature Schnauzer with ears cropped and tail docked]]
White is one of four color varieties of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]]. However, they are not accepted for [[conformation show]]ing by the [[American Kennel Club]] and [[Canadian Kennel Club]]. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation, namely whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two [[schnauzer]] types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the American Miniature Schnauzer Club chooses not to recognize white.<ref name="amsc-white">{{cite web |url=http://amsc.us/faqs-mainmenu-45/74-why-not-a-white-miniature-schnauzer.html |title=Why not a White Miniature Schnauzer? |work=AMSC.us |publisher=The American Miniature Schnauzer Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723095110/http://amsc.us/faqs-mainmenu-45/74-why-not-a-white-miniature-schnauzer.html |archive-date=23 July 2013}}</ref>

==Temperament==
[[File:Miniature Schnauzer dogshow Flickr.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|A Miniature Schnauzer with cropped ears and docked tail]]
The [[American Kennel Club]] breed standard describes temperament as "alert and spirited, yet obedient to command ... friendly, intelligent and willing to please... never overaggressive or timid".<ref name="AKCMiniature"/> Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, upon which they are typically very friendly to them.<ref name="kiedrowski">{{cite book |title=The New Miniature Schnauzer |publisher=Howell Book House |location=New York City |first=Dan |last=Kiedrowski |edition=2nd |pages=12 |year=1997 |isbn=0-87605-241-3 |oclc=36170497}}</ref> While the Miniature Schnauzer is included in the Terrier Group in North America (due to rat-catching background), it does not have common ancestry with [[Terrier]]s from Great Britain,<ref name="AKCMiniature"/><ref name="Abiqua"/> and compared to them has a different personality, being more laid back, obedient, friendly, and less aggressive to other dogs.<ref name="Magazine2011"/>

Miniature Schnauzers can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[Obedience training|obedience]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], and [[Tracking (dog)|tracking]]. Schnauzers have a high prey drive, which means they may chase other small animals and hence should not be off leash when not in a fenced area.<ref name="AKCMiniature"/> [[Stanley Coren]] ranked the Miniature Schnauzer 12th out of 140 breeds in his book ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'' (2006). Coren grouped the breed amongst "excellent working dogs". Additionally, experts contacted by Coren ranked the Miniature as fifth among top 15 breeds at watchdog barking ability.<ref name="Coren2006">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBzuXFdFECEC |title=The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions |publisher=Simon & Schuster |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Coren |pages=142–143, 149, 182, 192 |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7432-8087-7}}</ref>
