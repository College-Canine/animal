'''Pulmonary edema''' ([[British English]]: oedema), also known as '''pulmonary congestion''', is excessive [[edema|fluid accumulation]] in the [[parenchyma|tissue]] or [[pulmonary alveolus|air spaces]] (usually [[alveoli]]) of the [[lung]]s.<ref name="Dorland's">{{cite book |title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary |date=2 May 2011 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8 |page=593 |edition=32nd}}</ref> This leads to impaired [[gas exchange]], most often leading to [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]] which can progress to [[hypoxemia]] and [[respiratory failure]].

Various laboratory tests ([[Complete blood count|CBC]], [[troponin]], [[Brain natriuretic peptide 32|BNP]], etc.) and imaging studies ([[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]], [[Computed tomography of the chest|CT scan]], [[ultrasound]]) are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindow T, Quadrelli S, Ugander M | title = Noninvasive Imaging Methods for Quantification of Pulmonary Edema and Congestion: A Systematic Review | journal = JACC.

== Pathophysiology ==
The amount of fluid in the lungs is governed by multiple forces and is visualized using the [[Starling equation]]. There are two [[Hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressures]] and two [[Oncotic pressure|oncotic (protein) pressures]] that determine the fluid movement within the lung air spaces ([[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]). Of the forces that explain fluid movement, only the [[pulmonary wedge pressure]] is obtainable via [[Pulmonary artery catheter|pulmonary artery catheterization]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel MR, Bailey SR, Bonow RO, Chambers CE, Chan PS, Dehmer GJ, Kirtane AJ, Wann LS, Ward RP | display-authors = 6 | title = ACCF/SCAI/AATS/AHA/ASE/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCCM/SCCT/SCMR/STS 2012 appropriate use criteria for diagnostic catheterization: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation Appropriate Use Criteria Task Force, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, American Society of Echocardiography, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America, Heart Rhythm Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 59 | issue = 22 | pages = 1995–2027 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22578925 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.03.003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Due to the complication rate associated with pulmonary artery catheterization, other imaging modalities and diagnostic methods have become more popular.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajaram SS, Desai NK, Kalra A, Gajera M, Cavanaugh SK, Brampton W, Young D, Harvey S, Rowan K | display-authors = 6 | title = Pulmonary artery catheters for adult patients in intensive care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2013 | issue = 2 | pages = CD003408 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23450539 | pmc = 6517063 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003408.pub3 | article-number = CD003408 }}</ref> Imbalance in any of these forces can cause fluid movement (or lack of movement) causing a buildup of fluid where it should not normally be. Although rarely clinically measured, these forces allow us to classify, and subsequently treat the underlying cause of pulmonary edema.

==Classification==
Pulmonary edema has a multitude of causes, and is typically classified as cardiogenic or noncardiogenic. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure causing increased fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]. Noncardiogenic causes are associated with the oncotic pressure as discussed above causing malfunctioning barriers in the lungs (increased [[Endothelium|microvascular permeability]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Textbook of critical care |date=2024 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-75929-8 | veditors = Vincent J, Moore FA, Bellomo R, Marini JJ |edition=8th |location=Amsterdam }}</ref>  

=== Cardiogenic ===
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is typically caused by either volume overload or impaired [[Ventricle (heart)|left ventricular]] function. As a result, [[Pulmonary wedge pressure|pulmonary pressures]] rises from the normal average of 15 mmHg.<ref>[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/pah/pah_what.html What Is Pulmonary Hypertension?] From Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI). National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Last updated September 2008. Retrieved on 6 April 2009.</ref> As the pulmonary pressure rises, these pressures overwhelm the barriers and fluid  enters the alveoli when the pressure is above 25 mmHg.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Adair OV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IYFAsxAUA_MC |title=Cardiology secrets |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2001 |isbn=1-56053-420-6 |edition=2nd |at=Chapter 41, page 210}}</ref> Depending whether the cause is acute or chronic determines how fast pulmonary edema develops and the severity of symptoms.<ref name=":0" /> Some of the common causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include:
* Acute exacerbation of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] which is due to the heart's inability to pump the blood out of the pulmonary circulation at a sufficient rate resulting in elevation in [[pulmonary wedge pressure]] and edema. 
* [[Cardiac tamponade|Pericardial tamponade]] as well as treating pericardial tamponade via [[pericardiocentesis]] has shown to cause pulmonary edema as a result of increased left-sided heart strain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alerhand S, Adrian RJ, Long B, Avila J | title = Pericardial tamponade: A comprehensive emergency medicine and echocardiography review | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 58 | pages = 159–174 | date = August 2022 | pmid = 35696801 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2022.05.001 | s2cid = 248620419 }}</ref>
* [[Valvular heart disease|Heart Valve Dysfunction]] such as mitral valve regurgitation can cause increased pressure and energy on the left side of the heart (increased pulmonary wedge pressure) causing pulmonary edema.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = MacIver DH, Clark AL | title = The vital role of the right ventricle in the pathogenesis of acute pulmonary edema | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 115 | issue = 7 | pages = 992–1000 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25697920 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.01.026 }}</ref>
* [[Hypertensive crisis]] can cause pulmonary edema as the elevation in blood pressure and increased [[afterload]] on the left ventricle hinders forward flow in blood vessels and causes the elevation in [[wedge pressure]] and subsequent pulmonary edema. In a recent systematic review, it was found that pulmonary edema was the second most common condition associated with hypertensive crisis after [[ischemic stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddiqi TJ, Usman MS, Rashid AM, Javaid SS, Ahmed A, Clark D, Flack JM, Shimbo D, Choi E, Jones DW, Hall ME | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical Outcomes in Hypertensive Emergency: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 12 | issue = 14 | pages = e029355 | date = July 2023 | pmid = 37421281 | pmc = 10382109 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.122.029355 }}</ref>

==== Flash Pulmonary Edema ====
A particularly severe type of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is flash pulmonary edema (FPE). Flash pulmonary edema is a clinical syndrome of acute heart failure that begins suddenly and accelerates rapidly. Frequently the most noticeable abnormality is edema of the lungs. Nevertheless it is a cardiovascular disease not a pulmonary disease.  It is also known by other appellations including sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE).<ref>{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |vauthors=Siddiqua N, Mathew R, Sahu AK, Jamshed N, Bhaskararayuni J, Aggarwal P, Kumar A, Khan MA |date=January 2024 |title=High-dose versus low-dose intravenous nitroglycerine for sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema: a randomised controlled trial |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=96–102 |doi=10.1136/emermed-2023-213285 |pmid=38050078 |s2cid=265507643}}</ref> It is often associated with severe hypertension<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gandhi SK, Powers JC, Nomeir AM, Fowle K, Kitzman DW, Rankin KM, Little WC |date=January 2001 |title=The pathogenesis of acute pulmonary edema associated with hypertension |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=17–22 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440103 |pmid=11136955 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Typically, patients with the syndrome of flash pulmonary edema do not have chest pain are often not recognized as having a cardiovascular disease. Treatment of FPE should include reducing systemic vascular resistance with nitroglycerin, ensuring adequate oxygenation with non-invasive ventilation, and decrease of pulmonary circulation pressures while FPE stays.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Long B, Koyfman A, Gottlieb M |date=November 2018 |title=Management of Heart Failure in the Emergency Department Setting: An Evidence-Based Review of the Literature |journal=The Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=635–646 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.08.002 |pmid=30266198 |s2cid=52884356}}</ref>

===Noncardiogenic===
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased [[Microcirculation|microvascular permeability]] (increased [[oncotic pressure]]) leading to increased fluid  transfer into the alveolar spaces. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure is typically normal as opposed to cardiogenic pulmonary edema where the elevated pressure is causing the fluid transfer. There are multiple causes of noncardiogenic edema with multiple subtypes within each cause. [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Although ARDS can present with pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation), it is a distinct clinical syndrome that is not synonymous with pulmonary edema. 

==== Direct Lung Injury ====
[[Acute lung injury]] may cause pulmonary edema directly through injury to the vasculature and parenchyma of the lung, causes include:
* Inhalation of hot or toxic gases<ref name=":0" /> (including [[Vaping-associated pulmonary injury|vaping-associated lung injury]])
* [[Pulmonary contusion]], i.e., [[Physical trauma|high-energy trauma]] (e.g. vehicle accidents)
* [[Pulmonary aspiration|Aspiration]], e.g., gastric fluid
* Reexpansion, i.e. post large volume [[thoracocentesis]], resolution of pneumothorax, post decortication, removal of endobronchial obstruction, effectively a form of negative pressure pulmonary oedema.
* Reperfusion injury, i.e., postpulmonary [[thromboendartectomy]] or [[lung transplantation]]

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Respiratory system - Pulmonary edema -- Smart-Servier.png|thumb|224x224px|Fluid within the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] (air spaces) of the [[Lung|lungs]]]]
The most common symptom of pulmonary edema is [[shortness of breath|dyspnea]] and may include other symptoms relating to inadequate oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medicine)|hypoxia]]) such as fast breathing ([[tachypnea]]), [[tachycardia]] and [[cyanosis]]. Other common symptoms include [[haemoptysis|coughing up blood]] (classically seen as pink or red, frothy sputum), [[diaphoresis|excessive sweating]], [[anxiety]], and [[pallor|pale skin]]. Other signs include end-inspiratory [[crackles]] (crackling sounds heard at the end of a deep breath) on [[auscultation]] and the presence of a [[third heart sound]].<ref name="Ware" />

[[Shortness of breath]] can manifest as [[orthopnea]] (inability to breathe sufficiently when lying down flat due to breathlessness) and/or [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]] (episodes of severe sudden breathlessness at night). These are common presenting symptoms of chronic and cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. 

The development of pulmonary edema may be associated with symptoms and signs of "fluid overload" in the lungs; this is a non-specific term to describe the manifestations of ''right'' ventricular failure on the rest of the body. These symptoms may include peripheral [[edema]] (swelling of the legs, in general, of the "pitting" variety, wherein the skin is slow to return to normal when pressed upon due to fluid), raised [[jugular venous pressure]] and [[hepatomegaly]], where the liver is excessively enlarged and may be tender or even pulsatile. 

Additional symptoms such as fever, low blood pressure, injuries or burns may be present and can help characterize the cause and subsequent treatment strategies.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Comparison PE.png|thumb|294x294px|[[Chest X-ray]] of Pulmonary Edema with lines and overlay showing congestion]]
There is no single test for confirming that breathlessness is caused by pulmonary edema – there are many causes of [[shortness of breath]]; but there are methods to suggest a high probability of an edema.

=== Lab Tests ===

Low [[oxygen saturation]] in blood and disturbed [[arterial blood gas]] readings support the proposed diagnosis by suggesting a [[pulmonary shunt]]. Blood tests are performed for [[electrolyte]]s (sodium, potassium) and markers of [[renal function]] (creatinine, urea). Elevated creatine levels may suggest a cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema.<ref name=":0" /> [[Liver enzyme]]s, inflammatory markers (usually [[C-reactive protein]]) and a [[complete blood count]] as well as [[coagulation]] studies (PT, aPTT) are also typically requested as further diagnosis. Elevated white blood cell count ([[Complete blood count|WBC]]) may suggest a non-cardiogenic cause such as sepsis or infection.<ref name=":0" /> [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) is available in many hospitals, sometimes even as a point-of-care test. Low levels of BNP (<100 pg/ml) suggest a cardiac cause is unlikely, and suggest noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.<ref name="Ware" />

=== Imaging Tests ===
[[File:18-01-Lungenoedem CT coronar.png|thumb|Pulmonary edema on CT-scan (coronal [[CT scan#Multiplanar reconstruction and projections|MPR]])]]
Chest X-ray has been used for many years to diagnose pulmonary edema due to its wide availability and relatively cheap cost.<ref name=":1" /> A [[Chest radiograph|chest X-ray]] will show fluid in the alveolar walls, [[Kerley B lines]], increased vascular shadowing in a classical batwing peri-[[hilum of lung|hilum]] pattern, upper lobe diversion (biased blood flow to the superior parts instead of inferior parts of the lung), and possibly [[pleural effusion]]s. In contrast, patchy alveolar infiltrates are more typically associated with noncardiogenic edema.<ref name="Ware" /> 

Lung [[ultrasound]]s, employed by a healthcare provider at the point of care, is also a useful tool to diagnose pulmonary edema; not only is it accurate, but it may quantify the degree of lung water, track changes over time, and differentiate between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic edema.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volpicelli G, Elbarbary M, Blaivas M, Lichtenstein DA, Mathis G, Kirkpatrick AW, Melniker L, Gargani L, Noble VE, Via G, Dean A, Tsung JW, Soldati G, Copetti R, Bouhemad B, Reissig A, Agricola E, Rouby JJ, Arbelot C, Liteplo A, Sargsyan A, Silva F, Hoppmann R, Breitkreutz R, Seibel A, Neri L, Storti E, Petrovic T | display-authors = 6 | title = International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound | journal = Intensive Care Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 577–591 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22392031 | doi = 10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Lung ultrasound is recommended as the first-line method due to its wide availability, ability to be performed bedside, and wide diagnostic utility for other similar diseases.<ref name=":1" />

Especially in the case of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, urgent [[echocardiography]] may strengthen the diagnosis by demonstrating impaired left ventricular function, high [[central venous pressure]]s and high [[pulmonary artery]] pressures leading to pulmonary edema.

==Prevention==

[[Sildenafil]] is used as a preventive treatment for altitude-induced pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richalet JP, Gratadour P, Robach P, Pham I, Déchaux M, Joncquiert-Latarjet A, Mollard P, Brugniaux J, Cornolo J | display-authors = 6 | title = Sildenafil inhibits altitude-induced hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–281 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15516532 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200406-804OC | title-link = pulmonary hypertension }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perimenis P | title = Sildenafil for the treatment of altitude-induced hypoxaemia | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 835–837 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15934909 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.6.5.835 | s2cid = 24900169 }}</ref> Sildenafil's mechanism of action is via phosphodiesterase inhibition which raises cGMP, resulting in pulmonary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and indirectly fluid formation in the lungs.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Clark, Michael |author2=Kumar, Parveen J. |title=Kumar and Clark's clinical medicine |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2009 |page=783 |isbn=978-0-7020-2993-6}}</ref>  While this effect has only recently been discovered, sildenafil is already becoming an accepted treatment for this condition, in particular in situations where the standard treatment of rapid descent (acclimatization) has been delayed for some reason.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fagenholz PJ, Gutman JA, Murray AF, Harris NS | title = Treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema at 4240 m in Nepal | journal = High Altitude Medicine & Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–146 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17584008 | doi = 10.1089/ham.2007.3055 }}</ref>

==Management==
The initial management of pulmonary edema, irrespective of the type or cause, is supporting vital functions while edema lasts. [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] may require supplementary oxygen to balance blood oxygen levels, but if this is insufficient then again mechanical ventilation may be required to prevent complications caused by hypoxia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = MacIntyre NR | title = Supporting oxygenation in acute respiratory failure | journal = Respiratory Care | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–150 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23271824 | doi = 10.4187/respcare.02087 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Therefore, if the level of consciousness is decreased it may be required to proceed to [[tracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] to prevent airway compromise.  Treatment of the underlying cause is the next priority; pulmonary edema secondary to infection, for instance, would require the administration of appropriate [[antibiotic]]s or [[Antiviral drug|antivirals]].<ref name=assaad/><ref name=Ware/>

===Cardiogenic pulmonary edema===
Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema often responds rapidly to medical treatment.<ref name=Cleland>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleland JG, Yassin AS, Khadjooi K | title = Acute heart failure: focusing on acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema | journal = Clinical Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–64 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20408310 | pmc = 4954483 | doi = 10.7861/clinmedicine.10-1-59 }}</ref> Positioning upright may relieve symptoms. A [[loop diuretic]] such as [[furosemide]] is administered, often together with [[morphine]] to reduce respiratory distress.<ref name=Cleland/> Both diuretic and morphine may have [[vasodilator]] effects, but specific vasodilators may be used (particularly intravenous [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|glyceryl trinitrate]] or [[Isosorbide dinitrate|ISDN]]) provided the blood pressure is adequate.<ref name=Cleland/>

[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] and [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] (CPAP/BiPAP) has been demonstrated to reduce mortality and the need of mechanical ventilation in people with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema.<ref name="Cpap cochrane2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berbenetz N, Wang Y, Brown J, Godfrey C, Ahmad M, Vital FM, Lambiase P, Banerjee A, Bakhai A, Chong M | display-authors = 6 | title = Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or bilevel NPPV) for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | issue = 4 | pages = CD005351 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30950507 | pmc = 6449889 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005351.pub4 }}</ref>

It is possible for cardiogenic pulmonary edema to occur together with [[cardiogenic shock]], in which the cardiac output is insufficient to sustain an adequate blood pressure to the lungs. This can be treated with [[Inotrope|inotropic agents]] or by [[intra-aortic balloon pump]], but this is regarded as temporary treatment while the underlying cause is addressed and the lungs recover.<ref name=Cleland/>

== Prognosis ==
As pulmonary edema has a wide variety of causes and presentations, the outcome or prognosis is often disease-dependent and more accurately described in relation to the associated syndrome. It is a major health problem, with one large review stating an incidence of 7.6% with an associated in hospital mortality rate of 11.9%.<ref name="assaad"/>  Generally, pulmonary edema is associated with a poor prognosis with a 50% survival rate at one year, and 85% mortality at six years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanza C, Saglietti F, Tesauro M, Longhitano Y, Savioli G, Balzanelli MG, Romenskaya T, Cofone L, Pindinello I, Racca G, Racca F | display-authors = 6 | title = Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema in Emergency Medicine | journal = Advances in Respiratory Medicine | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 445–463 | date = October 2023 | pmid = 37887077 | pmc = 10604083 | doi = 10.3390/arm91050034 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
