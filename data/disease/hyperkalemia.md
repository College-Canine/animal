Hyperkalemia is rare among those who are otherwise healthy.<ref name=Kov2016/> Among those who are  hospitalized, rates are between 1% and 2.5%.<ref name=BMJ2015/> It is associated with an increased mortality, whether due to hyperkalaemia itself or as a marker of severe illness, especially in those without [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Einhorn |first1=Lisa M. |last2=Zhan |first2=Min |last3=Hsu |first3=Van Doren |last4=Walker |first4=Lori D. |last5=Moen |first5=Maureen F. |last6=Seliger |first6=Stephen L. |last7=Weir |first7=Matthew R. |last8=Fink |first8=Jeffrey C. |title=The Frequency of Hyperkalemia and Its Significance in Chronic Kidney Disease |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |date=22 June 2009 |volume=169 |issue=12 |pages=1156–1162 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.132 |pmid=19546417 |pmc=3544306 }}</ref><ref name=Kov2016>{{cite journal |last1=Kovesdy |first1=Csaba P |title=Updates in hyperkalemia: Outcomes and therapeutic strategies |journal=Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders |date=March 2017 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=41–47 |doi=10.1007/s11154-016-9384-x |pmid=27600582 |pmc=5339065 }}</ref> The word ''hyperkalemia'' comes from ''hyper-'' 'high' + ''kalium'' 'potassium' + [[List of medical roots, suffixes and prefixes|''-emia'' 'blood condition']].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Barbara J|last2=DePetris|first2=Ann|title=Medical Terminology: An Illustrated Guide|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9781451187564|page=326|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEOQXdrlt9wC&pg=PA326|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908183104/https://books.google.com/books?id=SEOQXdrlt9wC&pg=PA326|archive-date=2017-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Herlihy|first1=Barbara|title=The Human Body in Health and Illness|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9781455756421|page=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uX6zAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA487|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908183104/https://books.google.com/books?id=uX6zAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA487|archive-date=2017-09-08}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of an elevated potassium level are generally few and nonspecific.<ref name=NKF2020>{{cite web |title=What is Hyperkalemia? |url=https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/what-hyperkalemia |website=National Kidney Foundation |access-date=23 February 2020 |date=8 February 2016}}</ref> Nonspecific symptoms may include feeling tired, numbness  and weakness.<ref name=NKF2020/> Occasionally [[palpitations]] and shortness of breath may occur.<ref name=NKF2020/><ref name=symptoms-mayo>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/hyperkalemia/basics/when-to-see-doctor/sym-20050776 |title=High potassium (hyperkalemia) |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=2011-11-18 |access-date=2014-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228150609/http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/hyperkalemia/basics/when-to-see-doctor/sym-20050776 |archive-date=2014-02-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What is Hyperkalemia? |url=https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/what-hyperkalemia |website=[[National Kidney Foundation]] (NKF) |access-date=25 June 2019 |date=8 February 2016}}</ref> Hyperventilation may indicate a compensatory response to [[metabolic acidosis]], which is one of the possible causes of hyperkalemia.<ref name="Kovesdy2015">{{cite journal|last1=Kovesdy|first1=CP|title=Management of Hyperkalemia: An Update for the Internist|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=December 2015|volume=128|issue=12|pages=1281–7|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.05.040|pmid=26093176}}</ref> Often, however, the problem is detected during screening [[blood test]]s for a medical disorder, or after hospitalization for complications such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[sudden cardiac death]]. High levels of potassium (> 5.5{{nbsp}}mmol/L) have been associated with cardiovascular events.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

==Causes==

===Ineffective elimination===
[[Chronic kidney disease|Decreased kidney function]] is a major cause of hyperkalemia. This is especially pronounced in [[acute kidney injury]] where the glomerular filtration rate and tubular flow are markedly decreased, characterized by [[oliguria|reduced urine output]].<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> This can lead to a dramatically elevated potassium in conditions of increased cell breakdown as the potassium is released from the cells and cannot be eliminated in the kidney. In [[chronic kidney disease]], hyperkalemia occurs as a result of reduced aldosterone responsiveness and reduced sodium and water delivery in distal tubules.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/>

Medications that interfere with urinary excretion by inhibiting the [[renin–angiotensin system]] is one of the most common causes of hyperkalemia. Examples of medications that can cause hyperkalemia include [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin receptor blockers]],<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> non-selective [[beta blocker]]s, and [[calcineurin inhibitor]] immunosuppressants such as [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hwa Lee|first1=Chang|last2=Ho Kim|first2=Gheun|title=Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disturbances Induced by Clacineurin Inhibitors|journal=Electrolyte Blood Press|date=31 December 2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–130|doi=10.5049/EBP.2007.5.2.126|pmc=3894512|quote=Cyclosporine may reduce potassium excretion by altering the function of several transporters, decreasing the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and impairing tubular responsiveness to aldosterone|pmid=24459511}}</ref> For potassium-sparing [[diuretic]]s, such as [[amiloride]] and [[triamterene]]; both the drugs block epithelial sodium channels in the collecting tubules, thereby preventing potassium excretion into urine.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/> [[Spironolactone]] acts by competitively inhibiting the action of aldosterone.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], or [[Celebrex|celecoxib]] inhibit [[prostaglandin]] synthesis, leading to reduced production of renin and aldosterone, causing potassium retention.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Sejoong|last2=Joo|first2=KW|title=Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disturbances Associated with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs|journal=Electrolyte Blood Press|date=31 December 2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=116–125|doi=10.5049/EBP.2007.5.2.116|pmc=3894511|pmid=24459510}}</ref> The antibiotic [[trimethoprim]] and the [[Antihelminthic|antiparasitic medication]] [[pentamidine]] inhibits potassium excretion, which is similar to mechanism of action by amiloride and triamterene.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karet |first1=Fiona E. |title=Mechanisms in Hyperkalemic Renal Tubular Acidosis: Figure 1. |journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology |date=February 2009 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=251–254 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2008020166 |pmid=19193780 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Mineralocorticoid]] (aldosterone) deficiency or resistance can also cause hyperkalemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency are: [[Addison's disease]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=B Mount|first1=David|last2=H Sterns|first2=Richard|last3=Lacroix|first3=Andre|last4=Forman P|first4=John|title=Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency|publisher=UpToDate|access-date=6 October 2017|url-access=subscription}}</ref> and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia|congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)]] (including enzyme deficiencies such as [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency|21α hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency|17α hydroxylase]], [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency|11β hydroxylase]], or [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency|3β dehydrogenase]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=F Young|first1=William|last2=H Sterns|first2=Richard|last3=Forman|first3=John P|title=Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hypoaldosteronism (type 4 RTA)|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-hypoaldosteronism-type-4-rta |website=UpToDate|access-date=12 October 2017|quote=In children, hypoaldosteronism can result from a deficiency of enzymes required for aldosterone synthesis|url-access=subscription}}</ref>
* Type IV [[renal tubular acidosis]] (aldosterone resistance of the kidney's tubules)
* Gordon's syndrome ([[pseudohypoaldosteronism]] type II) ("familial hypertension with hyperkalemia"), a rare genetic disorder caused by defective modulators of salt transporters, including the [[Sodium-chloride symporter|thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter]].

===Excessive release from cells===
[[Metabolic acidosis]] can cause hyperkalemia as the elevated hydrogen ions in the cells can displace potassium, causing the potassium ions to leave the cell and enter the bloodstream. However, in [[respiratory acidosis]] or organic acidosis such as [[lactic acidosis]], the effect on serum potassium are much less significant although the mechanisms are not completely understood.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/>

Insulin deficiency can cause hyperkalemia as the [[hormone]] [[insulin]] increases the uptake of potassium into the cells. Hyperglycemia can also contribute to hyperkalemia by causing [[Renal physiology|hyperosmolality]] in extracellular fluid, increasing water diffusion out of the cells and causes potassium to move alongside water out of the cells also. The co-existence of insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality is often seen in those affected by [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]. Apart from diabetic ketoacidosis, there are other causes that reduce insulin levels such as the use of the medication [[octreotide]], and fasting which can also cause hyperkalemia. Increased tissue breakdown such as [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[burn]]s, or any cause of rapid tissue [[necrosis]], including [[tumor lysis syndrome]] can cause the release of intracellular potassium into blood, causing hyperkalemia.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/><ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/>

[[Beta2-adrenergic agonist]]s act on beta-2 receptors to drive potassium into the cells. Therefore, [[beta blocker]]s can raise potassium levels by blocking beta-2 receptors. However, the rise in potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples of drugs that can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as [[propranolol]] and [[labetalol]]. Beta-1 selective blockers such as [[metoprolol]] do not increase serum potassium levels.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/>{{medcn|date=August 2019}}

Exercise can cause a release of potassium into bloodstream by increasing the number of potassium channels in the cell membrane. The degree of potassium elevation varies with the degree of exercise, which range from 0.3 meq/L in light exercise to 2 meq/L in heavy exercise, with or without accompanying ECG changes or lactic acidosis. However, peak potassium levels can be reduced by prior physical conditioning and potassium levels are usually reversed several minutes after exercise.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/> High levels of [[adrenaline]] and [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]] have a protective effect on the cardiac electrophysiology because they bind to beta 2 adrenergic receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindinger MI | title = Potassium regulation during exercise and recovery in humans: implications for skeletal and cardiac muscle | journal = J.

[[Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] is an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] clinical condition where there is a mutation in gene located at 17q23 that regulates the production of protein [[Nav1.4|SCN4A]]. SCN4A is an important component of [[sodium channel]]s in skeletal muscles. During exercise, sodium channels would open to allow influx of sodium into the muscle cells for [[depolarization]] to occur. But in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, sodium channels are slow to close after exercise, causing excessive influx of sodium and displacement of potassium out of the cells.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gutmann|first1=Laurie|last2=Conwit|first2=Robin|last3=M shefner|first3=Jeremy|last4=L Wilterdink|first4=Janet|title=Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis?source=see_link&sectionName=PATHOGENESIS&anchor=H3#H3|publisher=UpToDate|access-date=3 October 2017|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Rare causes of hyperkalemia are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as [[digoxin]] toxicity may cause hyperkalemia<ref>{{EMedicine|article|154336|Digitalis Toxicity}}</ref> through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/> Massive [[blood transfusion]] can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium out of the red blood cells during storage.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/> Giving [[Suxamethonium chloride|succinylcholine]] to people with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. [[Arginine]] hydrochloride is used to treat [[refractory]] metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as [[Ciclosporin|cyclosporine]], [[tacrolimus]], [[diazoxide]], and [[minoxidil]] can cause hyperkalemia.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/> [[Box jellyfish]] venom can also cause hyperkalemia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haddad|first1=Vidal|title=Medical Emergencies Caused by Aquatic Animals: A Zoological and Clinical Guide|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319202884|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mR0DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA11 }}</ref>

===Excessive intake===
Excessive intake of potassium is not a primary cause of hyperkalemia because the human body usually can adapt to the rise in the potassium levels by increasing the excretion of potassium into urine through [[aldosterone]] hormone secretion and increasing the number of potassium secreting channels in kidney tubules. Acute hyperkalemia in infants is also rare even though their body volume is small, with accidental ingestion of potassium salts or potassium medications. Hyperkalemia usually develops when there are other co-morbidities such as [[hypoaldosteronism]] and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation">{{cite web|last1=B Mount|first1=David|last2=H Sterns|first2=Richard|last3=P Forman|first3=John|title=Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-evaluation-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults?source=search_result&search=hyperkalemia&selectedTitle=2~150|publisher=[[UpToDate]]|access-date=28 September 2017|date=5 June 2017|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

===Pseudohyperkalemia===
Pseudohyperkalemia occurs when the measured potassium level is falsely elevated.<ref name=Smellie2007>{{cite journal |last1=Smellie |first1=W Stuart A |title=Spurious hyperkalaemia |journal=BMJ |date=31 March 2007 |volume=334 |issue=7595 |pages=693–695 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39119.607986.47 |pmid=17395950 |pmc=1839224 }}</ref> This condition is usually suspected when the patient is clinically well without any ECG changes. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to [[haemolysis]] of the blood sample.<ref name=Smellie2007/> Repeated fist clenching during the blood draw can cause a transient rise in potassium levels.<ref>{{Citation |last=Simon |first=Leslie V. |title=Hyperkalemia |date=2024 |work=StatPearls |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470284/ |access-date=2024-04-27 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=29261936 |last2=Hashmi |first2=Muhammad F. |last3=Farrell |first3=Mitchell W.}}</ref> Prolonged length of blood storage can also increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may become apparent when a person's platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample ([[serum (blood)|serum]] blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. A high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in people with [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] increases the fragility of red blood cells, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because clot formation protects the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia, a benign condition characterised by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at cold temperatures, also exists. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.<ref name="UpToDate causes and evaluation"/>

==Mechanism==

=== Physiology ===
Potassium is the most abundant [[intracellular]] [[cation]] and about 98% of the body's potassium is found inside cells, with the remainder in the [[extracellular fluid]] including the blood. Membrane potential is maintained principally by the [[Molecular diffusion|concentration gradient]] and membrane permeability to potassium with some contribution from the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na+/K+ pump]]. The potassium gradient is critically important for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cellular [[membrane potential]], [[homeostasis]] of cell volume, and transmission of [[action potential]]s in [[nerve cell]]s.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

Potassium is eliminated from the body through the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[kidney]] and [[sweat gland]]s. In the kidneys, elimination of potassium is passive (through the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]]), and reabsorption is active in the [[proximal tubule]] and the ascending limb of the [[loop of Henle]]. There is active excretion of potassium in the [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]] and the [[Collecting duct system|collecting duct]]; both are controlled by [[aldosterone]]. In sweat glands potassium elimination is quite similar to the kidney, its excretion is also controlled by aldosterone.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Regulation of serum potassium is a function of intake, appropriate distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments, and effective bodily excretion.

=== Elevated potassium ===
Hyperkalemia develops when there is excess production (oral intake, tissue breakdown) or ineffective elimination of potassium. Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the kidney that impair excretion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Desai |first1=Akshay |title=Hyperkalemia Associated With Inhibitors of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System: Balancing Risk and Benefit |journal=Circulation |date=14 October 2008 |volume=118 |issue=16 |pages=1609–1611 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.807917 |pmid=18852376 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Increased extracellular potassium levels result in [[depolarization]] of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the [[Reversal potential|equilibrium potential]] of potassium. This depolarization opens some voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s, but also increases the inactivation at the same time. Since depolarization due to concentration change is slow, it never generates an action potential by itself; instead, it results in [[neural accommodation|accommodation]]. Above a certain level of potassium the depolarization inactivates sodium channels, opens potassium channels, thus the cells become [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory]]. This leads to the impairment of neuromuscular, [[cardiac]], and [[gastrointestinal]] organ systems. Of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction, which can cause [[ventricular fibrillation]] and/or [[Bradycardia|abnormally slow heart rhythms]].<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:HyperK2014.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|An ECG of a person with a potassium of 5.7 showing large T waves and small P waves]]
To gather enough information for diagnosis, the measurement of potassium must be repeated, as the elevation can be due to [[hemolysis]] in the first sample. The normal serum level of potassium is 3.5 to 5{{nbsp}}mmol/L. Generally, blood tests for [[kidney function]] ([[creatinine]], [[blood urea nitrogen]]), [[glucose]] and occasionally [[creatine kinase]] and [[cortisol]] are performed. Calculating the [[trans-tubular potassium gradient]] can sometimes help in distinguishing the cause of the hyperkalemia.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Also, [[electrocardiography]] (ECG) may be performed to determine if there is a significant risk of abnormal heart rhythms.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> Physicians taking a [[medical history]] may focus on [[Nephrology|kidney disease]] and [[medication]] use (e.g. [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]s), both of which are known causes of hyperkalemia.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

=== Definitions ===
Normal serum potassium levels are generally considered to be between 3.5 and 5.3 [[Molar concentration|mmol/L]].<ref name=EU2010/> Levels above 5.5{{nbsp}}mmol/L generally indicate hyperkalemia, and those below 3.5{{nbsp}}mmol/L indicate [[hypokalemia]].<ref name=Leh2011/><ref name=EU2010/>

===ECG findings===
With mild to moderate hyperkalemia, there is prolongation of the PR interval and development of peaked [[T wave]]s.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> Severe hyperkalemia results in a widening of the [[QRS complex]], and the [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] complex can evolve to a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] shape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teachmesurgery.com/post-operative/endocrine/hyperkalaemia/ |title=Hyperkalaemia - ECG Features - Management |access-date=2016-03-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325151835/http://teachmesurgery.com/post-operative/endocrine/hyperkalaemia/ |archive-date=2016-03-25 }}</ref> There appears to be a direct effect of elevated potassium on some of the potassium channels that increases their activity and speeds membrane repolarisation. Also, (as noted [[#Physiology|above]]), hyperkalemia causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels. The faster repolarisation of the cardiac [[action potential]] causes the tenting of the T waves, and the inactivation of sodium channels causes a sluggish conduction of the electrical wave around the heart, which leads to smaller P waves and widening of the QRS complex.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of potassium currents are sensitive to extracellular potassium levels, for reasons that are not well understood. As the extracellular potassium levels increase, potassium conductance is increased so that more potassium leaves the myocyte in any given time period.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parham WA, Mehdirad AA, Biermann KM, Fredman CS | year = 2006 | title = Hyperkalemia Revisited | journal = Tex.

The serum potassium concentration at which electrocardiographic changes develop is somewhat variable. Although the factors influencing the effect of serum potassium levels on cardiac electrophysiology are not entirely understood, the concentrations of other [[electrolyte]]s, as well as levels of catecholamines, play a major role.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}}

ECG findings are not a reliable finding in hyperkalemia. In a retrospective review, blinded cardiologists documented peaked T-waves in only 3 of 90 ECGs with hyperkalemia. [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] of peaked-Ts for hyperkalemia ranged from 0.18 to 0.52 depending on the criteria for peak-T waves.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Prevention==
Preventing recurrence of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or the addition of a [[diuretic]] (such as [[furosemide]] or [[hydrochlorothiazide]]).<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> Sodium [[polystyrene sulfonate]] and [[sorbitol]] (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

==Treatment==
Emergency lowering of potassium levels is needed when new arrhythmias occur at any level of potassium in the blood, or when potassium levels exceed 6.5{{nbsp}}mmol/L. Several agents are used to temporarily lower K<sup>+</sup> levels. The choice depends on the degree and cause of the hyperkalemia, and other aspects of the person's condition.

===Myocardial excitability===
Calcium ([[calcium chloride]] or [[calcium gluconate]]) increases [[threshold potential]] through a mechanism that is still unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8{{nbsp}}mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% calcium gluconate is also 10 mL but has only 2.26{{nbsp}}mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8{{nbsp}}mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/> The goal of treatment is to normalise the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.<ref name="Kovesdy2015"/>

Some textbooks suggest that calcium should not be given in digoxin toxicity as it has been linked to cardiovascular collapse in humans and increased digoxin toxicity in animal models. Recent literature questions the validity of this concern.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Temporary measures===
Several medical treatments shift potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cellular compartment, thereby reducing the risk of complications. The effect of these measures tends to be short-lived, but may temporise the problem until potassium can be removed from the body.<ref name="pmid20855477">{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott MJ, Ronksley PE, Clase CM, Ahmed SB, Hemmelgarn BR | title = Management of patients with acute hyperkalemia | journal = CMAJ | volume = 182 | issue = 15 | pages = 1631–5 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20855477 | pmc = 2952010 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.100461 }}</ref>
* [[Insulin]] (e.g. intravenous injection of 10 units of regular insulin along with 50 mL of 50% dextrose to prevent [[hypoglycemia|the blood sugar from dropping too low]]) leads to a shift of potassium ions into cells, secondary to increased activity of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium ATPase]].<ref name=AHA2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanden Hoek TL, Morrison LJ, Shuster M, Donnino M, Sinz E, Lavonas EJ, Jeejeebhoy FM, Gabrielli A | title = Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 18 Suppl 3 | pages = S829–61 | date = 2010-11-02 | pmid = 20956228 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Its effects last a few hours, so it sometimes must be repeated while other measures are taken to suppress potassium levels more permanently.

* [[Salbutamol]] (albuterol), a β<sub>2</sub>-selective catecholamine, is administered by nebuliser (e.g. 10–20{{nbsp}}mg). This medication also lowers blood levels of K<sup>+</sup> by promoting its movement into cells, and will work within 30 minutes.<ref name=AHA2010/> It is recommended to use 20&nbsp;mg for maximum potassium lowering effect, but to use lower doses if the patient is tachycardic or has ischaemic heart disease.  Note that 12-40% of patients do not respond to salbutamol therapy for reasons unknown, especially if on beta-blockers, so it should not be used as monotherapy<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ahee |first1=Peter |last2=Crowe |first2=Alexander V. |title=The management of hyperkalaemia in the emergency department |journal=Emergency Medicine Journal |date=1 May 2000 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=188–191 |doi=10.1136/emj.17.3.188 |pmid=10819381 |pmc=1725366 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
* [[Sodium bicarbonate]] may be used with the above measures if it is believed the person has [[metabolic acidosis]],<ref name=EU2010/> though time to effectiveness is longer and its use is controversial.

===Elimination===
Severe cases require [[hemodialysis]], which are the most rapid methods of removing potassium from the body.<ref name=AHA2010/> These are typically used if the underlying cause cannot be corrected swiftly while temporising measures are instituted or there is no response to these measures.

[[Loop diuretics]] ([[furosemide]], [[bumetanide]], [[torasemide]]) and [[thiazide]] diuretics (e.g., [[chlortalidone]], [[hydrochlorothiazide]], or [[chlorothiazide]]) can increase kidney potassium excretion in people with intact kidney function.<ref name=AHA2010/>

In the United States, hyperkalemia is induced by [[lethal injection]] in [[capital punishment]] cases. [[Potassium chloride]] is the last of the three drugs administered and actually causes death. Injecting potassium chloride into the heart muscle disrupts the signal that causes the heart to beat. This same amount of potassium chloride would do no harm if taken orally and not injected directly into the blood.
