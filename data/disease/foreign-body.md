A '''foreign body''' ('''FB''') is any object originating outside the body of an [[organism]]. In machinery, it can mean any unwanted intruding object.

Most references to foreign bodies involve propulsion through natural [[Body orifice|orifice]]s into hollow organs.

Foreign bodies can be inert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause [[inflammation]] and [[scar]]ring. They can bring [[infection]] into the body or acquire infectious agents and protect them from the body's [[immune system|immune defenses]]. They can obstruct passageways either by their size or by the scarring they cause. Some can be [[toxicity|toxic]] or generate toxic chemicals from reactions with chemicals produced by the body, as is the case with many examples of ingested metal objects.

With sufficient force (as in firing of [[bullet]]s), a foreign body can become lodged into nearly any tissue.

==Gastrointestinal tract==
{{main|Foreign body in alimentary tract}}
One of the most common locations for a foreign body is the [[alimentary tract]].

It is possible for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the mouth or rectum.

Both children and adults experience problems caused by foreign objects becoming lodged within their bodies. Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to insert objects into their ear canals and nostrils.<ref name="urlForeign Bodies: Nose and Paranasal Sinus Disorders: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch091/ch091d.html |title=Foreign Bodies: Nose and Paranasal Sinus Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |access-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826002831/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec08/ch091/ch091d.html |archive-date=2012-08-26 }}</ref> The severity of a foreign body can range from unconcerning to a life-threatening emergency. For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally is not a medical emergency to remove. A [[button battery]], which can be a very similar size to a coin, generates hydroxide ions at the anode and causes a chemical burn in two hours.<ref>{{cite web|last=Litovitz|first=Toby|url=http://www.poison.org/battery|title=Swallowed a Button Battery?|publisher=National Capital Poison Center|access-date=11 June 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817132805/http://www.poison.org/battery/|archive-date=17 August 2012}}</ref>  An ingested button battery that is stuck in the esophagus is a medical emergency. In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested nonmagnetic foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Avolio |first1=Luigi |last2=Martucciello |first2=Giuseppe |title=Ingested Magnets |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=25 June 2009 |volume=360 |issue=26 |pages=2770 |doi=10.1056/NEJMicm0801917|pmid=19553650 }}</ref>

==Pancreas==
Sometimes foreign bodies can pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract and perforate or penetrate the wall of stomach and duodenum and migrate into the pancreas. The laparoscopic approach before open surgery could be performed safely for the removal of foreign bodies embedded in the pancreas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mulita |first1=Francesk |last2=Papadopoulos |first2=George |last3=Tsochatzis |first3=Stelios |last4=Kehagias |first4=Ioannis |title=Laparoscopic removal of an ingested fish bone from the head of the pancreas: case report and review of literature |journal=Pan African Medical Journal |date=2020 |volume=36 |page=123 |doi=10.11604/pamj.2020.36.123.23948 |pmid=32849978 |pmc=7422735 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Airways==
{{main|Foreign body aspiration|Choking}}

It is possible for a foreign body to enter the airways and cause [[choking]].<ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview|title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine|access-date=2008-12-16|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227015106/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview|archive-date=2008-12-27}}</ref> A choking case can require the fast usage of basic [[Choking#Basic treatment (first aid)|anti-choking techniques]] to clear the airway.

==Eyes==
Airborne particles can lodge in the eyes of people at any age. These foreign bodies often result in [[allergy|allergies]] which are either temporary or even turn into a chronic allergy. This is especially evident in the case of [[dust]] particles.

It is also possible for larger objects to lodge in the eye. The most common cause of intraocular foreign bodies is [[hammer]]ing.<ref name="urlForeign Body, Intraocular: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230338-overview|title=Foreign Body, Intraocular: Overview - eMedicine|access-date=2008-12-16|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224235204/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1230338-overview|archive-date=2008-12-24}}</ref> Corneal foreign bodies are often encountered due to occupational exposure and can be prevented by instituting safety eye-wear at work place.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Onkar |first1=Abhishek |title=Commentary: Tackling the corneal foreign body |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |date=2020 |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.4103/ijo.IJO_1625_19|pmid=31856467 |pmc=6951207 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Peritoneum==
Foreign bodies in the [[peritoneum]] can include [[retained surgical instruments]] after [[abdominal surgery]]. Rarely, an [[intrauterine device]] can perforate the uterine wall and enter the peritoneum.

Foreign bodies in the peritoneum eventually become contained in a [[foreign body granuloma]]. In the extremely rare case of retained [[ectopic pregnancy]], this forms a [[lithopedion]], which involves the fetus being too large to be reabsorbed, and is [[calcification|calcified]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gedam |first1=B.S. |last2=Shah |first2=Yunus |last3=Deshmukh |first3=Shahaji |last4=Bansod |first4=Prasad Y. |date=2014-12-12 |title=Skeletal remains of mummified foetus for 36 years in mother's abdomen |journal=International Journal of Surgery Case Reports |volume=7 |pages=109–111 |doi=10.1016/j.ijscr.2014.10.074 |issn=2210-2612 |pmc=4336399 |pmid=25647606}}</ref> as a means of shielding the surrounding tissue from infection.

== Other animals ==
Foreign bodies are common in animals, especially young [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Dogs will readily eat toys, bones, and any object that either has food on it or retains the odor of food. Unlike humans, dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the [[esophagus]]. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the [[stomach]] because of the inability to pass through the [[pyloric sphincter]] into the [[jejunum]]. Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction include vomiting, abdominal pain often characterized by aggression, acute infection, and depression due to [[dehydration]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/diseases-of-the-stomach-and-intestines-in-small-animals/gastrointestinal-obstruction-in-small-animals|title=Gastrointestinal Obstruction in Small Animals - Digestive System - Merck Veterinary Manual|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref> Treatment of a foreign body is determined by its severity. The amount of time a foreign body is present, location of the object, degree of obstruction, previous health status of the animal and the type of material from which the foreign body is made can all determine the severity of the condition. [[Peritonitis]] results if either the stomach or intestine has ruptured. Foreign bodies in the stomach can sometimes be removed by [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] retrieval or if necessary by [[gastrotomy]].<ref name=":0" /> Very often, a simple instrument to remove foreign bodies without operation endoscopy is the [[Hartmann alligator forceps]]. The instrument is manufactured from 8&nbsp;cm to 1 m length. Foreign bodies in the jejunum are removed by [[enterotomy]].

Certain foreign bodies in animals are especially problematic. Bones or objects with sharp edges may cause tearing of the wall of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine and lead to peritonitis. [[Penny|Pennies]] swallowed in large numbers may cause [[zinc]] poisoning, which in dogs leads to severe [[gastroenteritis]] and [[hemolytic anemia]]. Linear foreign bodies can especially be dangerous.  A linear foreign body is usually a length of string or yarn with a larger object or clump of material at either end. One end is usually lodged in the stomach or proximal small intestine and the other end continues to travel through the intestines.  The material becomes tightly stretched and the intestines may "accordion up" on themselves or be lacerated by it. This is especially common in cats who may enjoy playing with a ball of string or yarn.  Sometimes the linear foreign body anchors in the mouth by catching under the tongue.<ref>[http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/terminology/g/G_linearfb.htm Glossary Term: Linear Foreign Body<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517192707/http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/terminology/g/G_linearfb.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}</ref> Pantyhose is a common linear foreign body in dogs.
