'''Adenocarcinoma'''<ref>From ''[[wikt:adeno-|adeno-]]'', "gland" and ''[[wikt:καρκίνος|karkin(o)-]]'', "cancerous" and ''[[wikt:-oma|-oma]]'', "tumor".</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|d|ɪ|n|oʊ|k|ɑːr|s|ɪ|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|ə}}; plural '''adenocarcinomas''' or '''adenocarcinomata''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|d|ɪ|n|oʊ|k|ɑːr|s|ɪ|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|ə|t|ə}}; '''AC''') is a type of [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] that can occur in several parts of the body. It is defined as [[neoplasia]] of [[epithelium|epithelial]] tissue that has [[gland]]ular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of [[carcinoma]]s, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus [[invasive ductal carcinoma]], the most common form of [[breast cancer]], is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name—however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of [[esophageal cancer]], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.

In the most specific usage, the glandular origin or traits are [[exocrine gland|exocrine]]; [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]] tumors, such as a [[VIPoma]], an [[insulinoma]], or a [[pheochromocytoma]], are typically not referred to as adenocarcinomas but rather are often called [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s. Epithelial tissue sometimes includes, but is not limited to, the surface layer of skin, glands, and a variety of other tissue that lines the cavities and organs of the body. Epithelial tissue can be derived embryologically from any of the [[germ layer]]s ([[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], or [[mesoderm]]). To be classified as adenocarcinoma, the cells do not necessarily need to be part of a [[gland]], as long as they have secretory properties. Adenocarcinoma is the [[malignancy|malignant]] counterpart to [[adenoma]], which is the [[benignity|benign]] form of such [[neoplasm|tumors]]. Sometimes adenomas [[malignant transformation|transform]] into adenocarcinomas, but most do not.

Well-[[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] adenocarcinomas tend to resemble the glandular tissue that they are derived from, while poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas may not. By [[staining]] the cells from a [[biopsy]], a [[pathologist]] can determine whether the tumor is an adenocarcinoma or some other type of cancer. Adenocarcinomas can arise in many tissues of the body owing to the ubiquitous nature of glands within the body, and, more fundamentally, to the [[cell potency|potency]] of epithelial cells. While each gland may not be secreting the same substance, as long as there is an exocrine function to the cell, it is considered glandular and its malignant form is therefore named adenocarcinoma.

===Breast===
Most [[breast cancer]]s start in the ducts or [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobules]], and are adenocarcinomas. The three most common histopathological types collectively represent approximately three-quarters of breast cancers:
* [[Invasive ductal carcinoma]]: 55% of breast cancers<ref name=USA-2004>Percentage values are from United States statistics 2004. Subtype specific incidences are taken from [https://archive.today/20130223233954/http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/6/1763/T6.expansion.html Table 6] (invasive) and [https://archive.today/20130223054758/http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/6/1763/T3.expansion.html Table 3] (in situ) from {{cite journal | vauthors = Eheman CR, Shaw KM, Ryerson AB, Miller JW, Ajani UA, White MC | title = The changing incidence of in situ and invasive ductal and lobular breast carcinomas: United States, 1999-2004 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1763–1769 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19454615 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-1082 | doi-access = free }}.

===Colon===
[[Image:Colon cancer.jpg|thumb|right|[[gross examination|Gross]] appearance of an opened [[colectomy]] specimen containing two [[Colorectal polyp|adenomatous polyps]] (the brownish oval tumors above the labels, attached to the normal beige lining by a stalk) and one '''invasive [[colorectal cancer|colorectal]] [[carcinoma]]''' (the crater-like, reddish, irregularly-shaped tumor located above the label)]]
[[File:Well-, moderately and poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma.png|thumb|300px|[[Histopathology]] of well-, moderately and poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma.]]

The vast majority of [[colorectal cancer]]s are adenocarcinomas. This is because the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] has numerous glands. Normal colonic glands tend to be simple and tubular in appearance with a mixture of [[mucus]]-secreting [[goblet cells]] and water-absorbing cells. These glands secrete mucus into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the colon to lubricate the feces as they pass towards the rectum.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Heath JE, Young B, Wheater PR, Lowe JN, Stevens A |title=Wheater's Functional histology: a text and colour atlas |url=https://archive.org/details/wheatersfunction00youn |url-access=limited |publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |edition=5th |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wheatersfunction00youn/page/n636 283] |isbn=978-0-443-06850-8 }}</ref>

When these glands undergo a number of changes at the genetic level, they proceed in a predictable manner as they move from benign to an invasive, malignant colon cancer. In their research paper "Lessons from Hereditary Colorectal Cancer", Vogelstein, et al., suggested that colon cells lose the [[Adenomatous polyposis coli|APC]] tumor suppressor gene and become a small polyp. Next, they suggested that [[KRAS|k-Ras]] becomes activated and the polyp becomes a small, benign adenoma. The adenoma, lacking the "carcinoma" attached to the end of it, suggests that it is a benign version of the malignant adenocarcinoma. The gastroenterologist uses a colonoscopy to find and remove these adenomas and polyps to prevent them from continuing to acquire genetic changes that will lead to an invasive adenocarcinoma. Vogelstein et al. went on to suggest that loss of the [[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer|DCC]] gene and of [[p53]] result in a malignant adenocarcinoma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B | title = Lessons from hereditary colorectal cancer | journal = Cell | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–170 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8861899 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81333-1 | s2cid = 18032613 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

There will be a mass of a different color to the surrounding tissue. Bleeding from the tumor is often apparent as the tumor tends to grow blood vessels into it in a haphazard manner via secretion of a number of [[angiogenesis]] promoting factors such as [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]]. [[Histology|Histologically]], tumours resembling the original structures are classified as well differentiated. Tumour cells that have lost any resemblance to original tissue, both in appearance and structure form, are denoted as poorly differentiated tumour cells. Regardless of the grade, malignant tumors tend to have a large nucleus with prominent [[nucleoli]]. There will also be a noticeable increase in the incidence of [[mitosis]], or cell divisions.{{cn|date=May 2021}}
