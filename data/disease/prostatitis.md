'''Prostatitis''' is an umbrella term for a variety of medical conditions that incorporate bacterial and non-bacterial origin illnesses in the pelvic region. In contrast with the plain meaning of the word (which means "inflammation of the prostate"), the diagnosis may not always include [[inflammation]]. Prostatitis is classified into acute, chronic, [[asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis]], and [[chronic pelvic pain syndrome]].

In the [[United States]], prostatitis is diagnosed in 8% of all male [[urologist]] visits and 1% of all [[primary care physician]] visits for male genitourinary symptoms.<ref name="pmid9507840">{{cite journal |vauthors=Collins MM, Stafford RS, O'Leary MP, Barry MJ |title=How common is prostatitis?

==Classification==
The term ''prostatitis'' refers to inflammation of the tissue of the [[prostate gland]]. It may occur as an appropriate physiological response to an infection, or it may occur in the absence of infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link1=Roger Kirby|last1=Kirby|first1=Roger|author-link2=Culley C.

In 1999, the [[List of institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] (NIDDK) devised a new classification system.<ref name="pmid10422990">{{cite journal |vauthors=Krieger JN, Nyberg L, Nickel JC |title=NIH consensus definition and classification of prostatitis |journal=JAMA |volume=282 |issue=3 |pages=236–7 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10422990 |doi= 10.1001/jama.282.3.236}}</ref><ref name="Nickel1999">{{cite book|author=J.

In 1968, Meares and Stamey determined a classification technique based upon the culturing of bacteria.<ref name="pmid4870505">{{cite journal |vauthors=Meares EM, Stamey TA |title=Bacteriologic localization patterns in bacterial prostatitis and urethritis |journal=Invest Urol |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=492–518 |date=March 1968 |pmid=4870505 }}</ref> This classification is no longer used.

The conditions are distinguished by the different presentation of pain, [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) in the urine, duration of symptoms and [[bacteria]] [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] from the urine. To help express prostatic secretions that may contain WBCs and bacteria, [[prostate massage]] is sometimes used.<ref name="Prostatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary_disorders/benign_prostate_disease/prostatitis.html |title=Prostatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional |access-date=2011-07-11 |archive-date=2011-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925051318/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary_disorders/benign_prostate_disease/prostatitis.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
