[[File:PacNW_satellite_cropped.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The Pacific Northwest from [[outer space]].]]

The '''Pacific Northwest''' ('''PNW'''), sometimes referred to as '''Cascadia''', is a geographic region in western [[North America]] bounded by its coastal waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and, loosely, by the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the east. Though no official boundary exists, the most common conception includes the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],   northern [[Idaho]], and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]. Some broader conceptions reach north into [[Alaska]] and [[Yukon]], south into [[northern California]], and east into western [[Montana]]. Other conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascade]] and [[Coast Mountains|Coast]] mountains.

The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest, and the Northwest Plateau (also commonly known as "[[British Columbia Interior|the Interior]]" in British Columbia),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interiorsavingscentre.com/index.shtml |title=Interior Savings Centre in Kamloops, British Columbia |work=Interiorsavingscentre.com |access-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812033526/http://www.interiorsavingscentre.com/index.shtml |archive-date=August 12, 2010 }}</ref> is the inland region. The term "Pacific Northwest" should not be confused with the [[Northwest Territory]] (also known as the Great Northwest, a historical term in the United States) or the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]]. The region is sometimes referred to as Cascadia, which, depending on the borders, may or may not be the same thing as the Pacific Northwest.

The region's largest metropolitan areas are [[Seattle metropolitan area|Greater Seattle]], Washington, with 4&nbsp;million people;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/Metro/Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue-Washington.aspx |title=Best Places to Live in Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington Metro Area (WA) |work=Bestplaces.net |access-date=August 18, 2010}}</ref> [[Metro Vancouver]], British Columbia, with 2.84 million people;<ref name=":1">{{cite web|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2021-01-14|title=Population estimates, July 1, by census metropolitan area and census agglomeration, 2021 boundaries|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710013501|access-date=2021-04-17|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref> and [[Portland metropolitan area|Greater Portland]], Oregon, with 2.5&nbsp;million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business.gov/states/oregon/local/portland.html|title=Doing Business in Portland, Oregon|work=Business.GOV|access-date=December 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210122253/http://www.business.gov/states/oregon/local/portland.html|archive-date=December 10, 2009}}</ref>

The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the [[Canada–United States border]], which the United States and the [[United Kingdom]] established at a time when the region's inhabitants were composed mostly of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. Two sections of the border—one along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] south of British Columbia and one between the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaska Panhandle]] and northern British Columbia—have left a great impact on the region. According to Canadian historian [[Ken Coates (historian)|Ken Coates]], the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest—rather, "the region's history and character have been determined by the boundary".<ref name="coates"/>

===Indigenous peoples===
{{See also|Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau}}

The Pacific Northwest has been occupied by a diverse array of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] for millennia. The Pacific Coast is seen by some scholars as a major [[coastal migration (Americas)|coastal migration route]] in the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] by late Pleistocene peoples moving from northeast Asia into the Americas.<ref name="surovell2003">{{cite journal |title= Simulating Coastal Migration in New World Colonization |last= Surovell |first =Todd A. |journal= [[Current Anthropology]] |publisher= [[Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]] |issn= 1537-5382 |volume= 44 |issue= 4 |year= 2003 |pages= 580–91 |doi= 10.1086/377651 |jstor= 10.1086/377651 |s2cid= 144347880 }}</ref>

On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of [[Coos Bay, Oregon]], and then sailed south while searching for a suitable harbor to repair his ailing ship.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Von der Porten| first1 = Edward | last2 = Aker| first2 = Raymond | last3 = Allen| first3 = Robert W. | last4 = Spitze| first4 = James | title = Who Made Drake's Plate of Brass?

In 1779, a third Spanish expedition, under the command of [[Ignacio de Arteaga y Bazán|Ignacio de Artega]] in the ship ''Princesa'', and with Quadra as captain of the ship ''Favorite'', sailed from Mexico to the coast of Alaska, reaching [[61st parallel north|61° N]]. Two further Spanish expeditions, in 1788 and 1789, both under [[Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra|Esteban Jose Martínez]] and [[Gonzalo López de Haro]], sailed to the Pacific Northwest. During the second expedition, they met the American captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] near [[Nootka Sound]]. Upon entering Nootka Sound, they found [[William Douglas (sea captain)|William Douglas]] and his ship ''Iphigenia''. Conflict led to the [[Nootka Crisis]], which was resolved by agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]. In 1790, the Spanish sent three ships to Nootka Sound, under the command of [[Francisco de Eliza]]. After establishing a base at Nootka, Eliza sent out several exploration parties. [[Salvador Fidalgo]] was sent north to the Alaska coast. [[Manuel Quimper]], with Gonzalo López de Haro as pilot, explored the Strait of Juan de Fuca, discovering the [[San Juan Islands]] and [[Admiralty Inlet]] in the process. Francisco de Eliza himself took the ship ''San Carlos'' into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. From a base at [[Port Discovery, Washington|Port Discovery]], his ''pilotos'' ([[Master (naval)|masters]]) [[José María Narváez]] and [[Juan Carrasco (explorer)|Juan Carrasco]] explored the [[San Juan Islands]], [[Haro Strait]], [[Rosario Strait]], and [[Bellingham Bay]]. In the process, they discovered the [[Strait of Georgia]] and explored it as far north as [[Texada Island]]. The expedition returned to Nootka Sound by August 1791. [[Alessandro Malaspina]], sailing for Spain, explored and mapped the coast from [[Yakutat Bay]] to Prince William Sound in 1791, then sailed to Nootka Sound. Performing a scientific expedition in the manner of James Cook, Malaspina's scientists studied the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] and [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] peoples before returning to Mexico. Another Spanish explorer, [[Jacinto Caamaño]], sailed the ship ''Aranzazu'' to Nootka Sound in May 1792. There he met Quadra, who was in command of the Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel]]. Quadra sent Caamaño north, to carefully explore the coast between Vancouver Island and [[Bucareli Bay]], Alaska. Various Spanish maps, including Caamaño's, were given to George Vancouver in 1792, as the Spanish and British worked together to chart the complex coastline.<ref name="hayes"/>

From 1792 to 1794, [[George Vancouver]] charted the Pacific Northwest on behalf of Great Britain, including the Strait of Georgia, the bays and inlets of [[Puget Sound]], and the [[Johnstone Strait]]–[[Queen Charlotte Strait]] and much of the rest of the [[British Columbia Coast]] and southeast Alaska shorelines.<ref name="ubcic.bc.ca"/> For him the city of [[Vancouver]] and Vancouver Island are named, as well as [[Vancouver, Washington]]. From Mexico, Malaspina dispatched the last Spanish exploration expedition in the Pacific Northwest, under [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]] and [[Cayetano Valdés y Flores|Cayentano Valdes]] aboard the schooners ''[[Sutil (ship)|Sutil]]'' and ''[[Mexicana (ship)|Mexicana]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mala.bc.ca/www/discover/capt/capt.htm |title= Captain Alexandro Malaspina |access-date= February 5, 2008 |publisher= Malaspina University-College |archive-date= February 6, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120206212620/http://www.mala.bc.ca/www/discover/capt/capt.htm |url-status= dead }}</ref> They met Vancouver in the Strait of Georgia on June&nbsp;21, 1792. Vancouver had explored Puget Sound just previously. The Spanish explorers knew of Admiralty Inlet and the unexplored region to the south, but they decided to sail north. They discovered and entered the [[Fraser River]] shortly before meeting Vancouver. After sharing maps and agreeing to cooperate, Galiano, Valdés, and Vancouver sailed north to [[Desolation Sound]] and the [[Discovery Islands]], charting the coastline together. They passed through Johnstone Strait and [[Cordero Channel]] and returned to Nootka Sound. As a result, the Spanish explorers, who had set out from Nootka, became the first Europeans to circumnavigate Vancouver Island. Vancouver himself had entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca directly without going to Nootka first, so had not sailed completely around the island.<ref name="hayes"/>

In 1786, [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]], representing France, sailed to Haida Gwaii after visiting Nootka Sound, but any possible French claims to this region were lost when La Pérouse and his men and journals were lost in a shipwreck near Australia. Upon encountering the Salish coastal tribes, either Pérouse or someone in his crew remarked, "What must astonish most is to see painting everywhere, everywhere sculpture, among a nation of hunters".<ref>Boyer, Paul S. ''The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People''. (Lexington MA 1996), p. 6</ref> [[Maritime fur trade]]r [[Charles William Barkley]] also visited the area in [[Imperial Eagle (ship)|''Imperial Eagle'']], a British ship falsely flying the flag of the [[Austrian Empire]]. American merchant sea-captain [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] traded along the coast, and discovered the mouth of the [[Columbia River]].

===Continental crossover exploration===
Explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] completed in 1793 the first continental crossing in what is called today central [[British Columbia]] and reached the [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] explored and mapped the [[Fraser River]] from Central British Columbia down to its mouth in 1808. And mapmaker [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] explored in 1811 the entire route of the Columbia River from its northern headwaters all the way to its mouth. These explorations were commissioned by the [[North West Company]] and were all undertaken with small teams of [[Voyageurs]].

United States President [[Thomas Jefferson]] commissioned the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] to travel through the Midwest starting from [[St. Louis]], cross the [[Continental Divide]] and reach the Columbia River up to its mouth. Americans reached the [[Pacific Ocean]] "overland" in 1805. The [[Pacific Fur Company]] sent in 1811 an "over-lander" crew including a large contingent of [[Voyageurs]] to retrace most of the path of the earlier expedition up to the mouth of the Columbia and join the company ship. The ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' came oversea via [[Cape Horn]] to build and operate [[Fort Astoria]].

These early land expeditions mapped the way for subsequent land explorations and building early settlements.

===Subsequent land explorations===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
The [[Willamette River]] was the first PNW inland waterway to be explored north–south during trapping expeditions carried out throughout the 1810s by the [[Pacific Fur Company]] soon acquired by the [[North West Company]] (NWC). During the 1820s, the upper Willamette, the [[Umpqua River|Umpqua]], the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue]], the [[Klamath River|Klamath]] were all reached still heading southward up toward the [[Sacramento River]] and [[California]] under the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) having now itself acquired the NWC. The [[Siskiyou Trail]] was gradually being established by [[Alexander Roderick McLeod]] and [[Peter Skene Ogden]] leading related expeditions for the HBC.
 
Also during the 1820s, HBC explorations were carried out northward originating from the [[Columbia River]] [[Fort Astoria]] long renamed to Fort George. Simon Plamondon first ventured during the early 20s  into the [[Cowlitz River]] up to [[Cowlitz Prairie]]. By 1824, an expedition led by [[James McMillan (fur trader)|James McMillan]] was reaching [[Puget Sound]] via the [[Chehalis River (Washington)]] and a portage. The same expedition went on all the way to [[Boundary Bay]] and reached the [[Fraser River]] via the [[Nicomekl River|Nicomekl]] and the [[Salmon River (Langley)|Salmon]] linked via a portage. The lower Fraser was revisited 16 years after explorer [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] (NWC) had first reached its mouth, although originating from northern present-day [[British Columbia]]. Puget Sound soon after would get reached via the Cowlitz and the Cowlitz Landing portage, but originating from new HBC headquarter [[Fort Vancouver]] located closer by, North of the Columbia.

===Early settlements===
[[File:View of New Archangel, 1837.tif|thumb|right|New Archangel (present-day [[Sitka, Alaska]]), the capital of Russian America]]
Noteworthy Russian settlements still in place include: [[Unalaska]] (1774), [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] (1791), and [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] (1804) making them the oldest permanent non-Indigenous settlements in the Pacific Northwest. Temporary Spanish settlement [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]] (1789–1795) held on a few years at [[Nootka Sound]].

Other early occupation non-Indigenous settlements of interest, either long lasting or still in place, built and operated by either the [[North West Company]], the [[Pacific Fur Company]] or the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] include: [[Fort St. James|Fort Saint-James]] (1806; oldest in British Columbia west of the Rockies), [[Fort Astoria]] (1811; oldest in Oregon), [[Fort Nez Percés]] (1818), [[Fort Alexandria]] (1821), [[Fort Vancouver]] (1824), [[Fort Langley]] (1827; oldest in southern British Columbia), [[Fort Nisqually]] (1833), and [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843).

Also of interest are the first mixed ancestry settlements sometimes referred as Métis settlements or French Canadian settlements. Native and newly arrived "half-breeds" (born out of "Europeans" and Indigenous alliances), local and newly arrived Indigenous people as well as "French Canadians" all issued of the fur trade were all able to peacefully coexist. Small scale farming occurred. Catholic missions and churches thrived for many years. These first settlements were: [[French Prairie]], [[Frenchtown, Washington|Frenchtown]] near Walla Walla, [[Cowlitz Prairie]] (Washington), [[French Settlement, Oregon|French Settlement]] (Oregon) and [[Frenchtown, Montana|Frenchtown]] near Missoula. Most mixed ancestry people ended up resettled in or around Indigenous reserves during the subsequent period, or otherwise assimilating in the mainstream.<ref>Barman, Jean ''French Canadians, Furs, and Indigenous Women in the Making of the Pacific Northwest''.

===Boundary disputes===
[[File:Pacific-Northwest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]]' 1841 Map of the [[Oregon Territory]] from "Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition". Philadelphia: 1845]]

Initial formal claims to the region were asserted by Spain in 1513 with explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Nuñez de Balboa]], the first European to sight the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Russian [[maritime fur trade]] activity, through the [[Russian-American Company]], extended from the farther side of the Pacific to ''[[Russian America]]''. This prompted Spain to send expeditions north to assert Spanish ownership, while Captain James Cook and subsequent expeditions by George Vancouver advanced British claims. As of the [[Nootka Convention|Nootka Sound Conventions]], the last in 1794, Spain gave up its exclusive a priori claims and agreed to share the region with the other [[Great power|powers]], giving up its garrison at Nootka Sound in the process.

The United States established a claim based on the discoveries of [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]], the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], the construction of Fort Astoria, and the acquisition of Spanish claims given to the United States in the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]].<ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Robert J.|title=Native America, Discovered and Conquered: Thomas Jefferson, Lewis & Clark, and Manifest Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccnP7tWU7hwC&pg=PA133|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99011-4|pages=133–134}}</ref> From the 1810s until the 1840s, modern-day Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, along with most of British Columbia, were part of what the United States called the [[Oregon Country]] and Britain called the [[Columbia District]]. This region was jointly claimed by the United States and Great Britain after the [[Treaty of 1818]], which established a co-dominion of interests in the region in lieu of a settlement. In 1840, American [[Charles Wilkes]] explored in the area. [[John McLoughlin]], Chief Factor of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], headquartered at Fort Vancouver, was the ''de facto'' local political authority for most of this time.

This arrangement ended as U.S. settlement grew and President [[James K. Polk]] was elected on a platform of calling for annexation of the entire Oregon Country and of Texas. After his election, supporters coined the famous slogan "Fifty-four Forty or Fight", referring to [[Parallel 54°40′ north|54°40′ north latitude]]—the northward limit of the United States' claim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/5440orfight.htm |title=Fifty-Four Forty or Fight |work=Geography.about.com |date=June 14, 2010 |access-date=August 18, 2010 |archive-date=December 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205125618/http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/5440orfight.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> After a war scare with the United Kingdom, the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled in the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]], partitioning the region along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] and resolving most, but not all, of the border disputes (see [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]]).

The mainland territory north of the 49th parallel remained unincorporated until 1858, when a mass influx of Americans and others during the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] forced the hand of [[Colony of Vancouver Island]]'s Governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], who declared the mainland a [[Crown colony]]. The two colonies were amalgamated in 1866 to cut costs, and joined the [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]] in 1871. The U.S. portion became the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1848. It was later subdivided into Oregon Territory and [[Washington Territory]]. These territories became the states of Oregon, Idaho, Washington and parts of other Western states.

During the [[American Civil War]], British Columbia officials pushed for London to invade and conquer the Washington Territory in effort to take advantage of Americans being distracted in the war on the Eastern region. This was rejected, as the UK did not wish to risk war with the United States, whose forces were better prepared and trained much more than the British troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://content.ucpress.edu/chapters/12840.ch01.pdf#page=5|title=Thwarting Southern Schemes and British Bluster in the Pacific Northwest|pages=5–6|author=James Robbins Jewell}}</ref>

American expansionist pressure on British Columbia persisted after the colony became a province of Canada, even though Americans living in the province did not harbor [[Annexationist movements of Canada|annexationist]] inclinations. The [[Fenian Brotherhood]] openly organized and drilled in Washington, particularly in the 1870s and the 1880s, though no cross-border attacks were experienced. During the [[Alaska Boundary Dispute]], U.S. President [[Teddy Roosevelt]] threatened to invade and annex British Columbia if Britain would not yield on the question of the [[Yukon]] ports. In more recent times, during the so-called "[[Pacific Salmon War|Salmon War]]" of the 1990s, Washington Senator [[Slade Gorton]] called for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] to "force" the [[Inside Passage]], even though it is not an official international waterway. Disputes between British Columbia and Alaska over the [[Dixon Entrance]] of the [[Hecate Strait]] between [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] and [[Haida Gwaii]] have not been resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwilson.com/pubs/energy/alaska.pdf |title=The Alaska Boundary Dispute |access-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218165011/http://www.cwilson.com/pubs/energy/alaska.pdf |archive-date=December 18, 2008 }}</ref>

The Pacific Northwest is a diverse geographic region, dominated by several mountain ranges, including the [[Coast Mountains]], the [[Cascade Range]], the [[Olympic Mountains]], the [[Columbia Mountains]], and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The highest peak in the Pacific Northwest is Mount Rainier, in the Washington Cascades, at {{convert|14410|ft|m|0}}. Immediately inland from the Cascade Range are broad, generally dry plateaus. In the US, this region is known as the [[Columbia Plateau]], while in British Columbia, it is the [[Interior Plateau]], also called the [[Fraser Plateau]]. The Columbia Plateau was the scene of massive ice-age floods, and as a consequence, there are many [[coulee]]s, canyons, and the [[Channeled Scablands]]. Much of the plateau, especially in eastern Washington, is [[irrigated]] [[arable land|farmland]].<ref name="schillinger2010">{{cite book | last1 = Schillinger | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Papendick | first2 = R.I. | last3 = McCool | first3 = D.K. | chapter = Soil and Water Challenges for Pacific Northwest Agriculture | title = Soil and Water Conservation Advances in the United States | series = SSSA Special Publications | year = 2010 | volume = 60 | pages = 47–79 | doi = 10.2136/sssaspecpub60.c2 | editor-last1 = Zobeck | editor-first1 = T.M. | editor-last2 = Schillinger | editor-first2 = W.F. | isbn = 9780891188520}}</ref> The Columbia River cuts a deep and wide gorge around the rim of the Columbia Plateau and through the Cascade Range on its way to the Pacific Ocean.

Because many areas have plentiful rainfall and mild summers, the Pacific Northwest has some of North America's most lush and extensive forests, which are extensively populated with [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|Coast Douglas fir]] trees, the second tallest growing [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] on earth. The region also contains specimens of the [[List of tallest trees|tallest trees]] on earth, the [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwoods]], in southwestern Oregon, but the largest of these trees are located just south of the California border in northwestern California. Coastal forests in some areas are classified as [[temperate rain forest]].

Coastal features are defined by the interaction with the Pacific and the North American continent. The coastline of the Pacific Northwest is dotted by numerous fjords, bays, islands, and mountains. Some of these features include the [[Oregon Coast]], [[Burrard Inlet]], [[Puget Sound]], and the highly complex fjords of the [[British Columbia Coast]] and [[Southeast Alaska]]. The region has one of the world's longest [[fjord]] coastlines.<ref name="Howe2010">{{cite book|last=Howe|first=J.

The Pacific Northwest contains an uncountable number of islands, many of the smaller ones being unnamed. The vast majority of such islands are in British Columbia and Alaska. Vancouver Island is by far the largest island in the area, but other significant land masses include the [[Haida Gwaii]], vast and remote [[Princess Royal Island]], [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] and [[Chichagof Island]]. The [[Salish Sea]] located close to major populated areas contains smaller but more frequently visited and well known islands. These include [[Whidbey Island]], [[Salt Spring Island]], and [[Texada Island]], along with dozens of smaller islands in the [[San Juan Islands|San Juan]] and [[Gulf Islands|Gulf Island]] chains.

The major cities of Vancouver, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]], and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] all began as [[seaport]]s supporting the logging, mining, and farming industries of the region, but have developed into major technological and industrial centers (such as the [[Silicon Forest]]), which benefit from their location on the [[Pacific Rim]].

If defined as British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, the Pacific Northwest has four [[List of National Parks of the United States|US National Parks]]: [[Crater Lake National Park|Crater Lake]] in Oregon, and [[Olympic National Park|Olympic]], [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]], and [[North Cascades National Park|North Cascades]] in Washington. If a larger regional definition is used, then other US National Parks might be included, such as [[Redwood National and State Parks]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell–St. Elias National Park]], [[Grand Teton National Park]], and parts of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]]. There are several [[National parks of Canada|Canadian National Parks]] in the Pacific Northwest, including [[Pacific Rim National Park]] on the west coast of Vancouver Island, [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]] and [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]] in the Selkirk Range alongside [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]], [[Kootenay National Park]] and [[Yoho National Park]] on the British Columbia flank of the Rockies, [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve]] in Haida Gwaii, and the [[Gulf Islands National Park Reserve]] in the Strait of Georgia. There are numerous [[List of protected areas of British Columbia|protected areas in British Columbia]] and [[Protected areas of the United States|in the United States]].

Other outstanding natural features include the [[Columbia River Gorge]], [[Fraser Canyon]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Malaspina Glacier]], and [[Hells Canyon]]. The south-central Coast Mountains in British Columbia contain the five largest mid-latitude [[icefield]]s in the world.

===Climate===
The main general climatic types of the Pacific Northwest are temperate; cool temperatures and frequent cloudy skies are typical. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], a [[warm-summer Mediterranean]] (''Csb'') designation is assigned to many areas of the Pacific Northwest as far north as central Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]], including cities such as [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Vancouver (coast area), Seattle, and Portland.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peel |first1=M.

[[Semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climates are found east of the higher mountains, especially in [[rainshadow]] areas. The [[Harney Basin]] of Oregon is an example of arid climate in the Pacific Northwest. [[Humid continental]] climates occur inland on windward sides, in places such as [[Revelstoke, British Columbia]]. A [[subarctic climate]] can be found farther north, especially in Yukon and Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/North_America_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png|title=North America Köppen Map}}</ref>

The lack of rain in the hot season is associated with [[High-pressure area|high atmospheric pressure]]. The shadows of the mountains also greatly decrease the amount of precipitation. West of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], the marine climates have a much greater precipitation than the west coast of [[Europe]] due to [[orographic lift]], with some regions seeing as much as 3,500&nbsp;mm (138&nbsp;in) of precipitation per year. Winters are very mild for the region's latitude. The growth of ''[[Arbutus]]'', an evergreen broad-leafed tree, is possible on Vancouver Island due to the mild winters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/weather/2014/07/the_pacific_ocean_and_oregons.html|title=Portland cooldown coming: Oregon's summer Mediterranean climate explained (video)|last=Tomlinson|first=Stuart|date=July 15, 2014|website=oregonlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/opinion/seattle-on-the-mediterranean.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Seattle on the Mediterranean|last=Egan|first=Timothy|date=July 3, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 15, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/vegetation-regions|title=Vegetation Regions|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=September 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/on-vancouver-island-summer-droughts-are-the-new-normal|title=On Vancouver Island, Summer Droughts Are the New Normal|website=www.cbc.ca|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arbutusridge.ca/climate/|title=Climate|website=Arbutus Ridge Active Adult Retirement Community|language=en-US|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215758/https://www.arbutusridge.ca/climate/|archive-date=February 15, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-characteristics-of-an-oceanic-type-of-climate.html|title=What Are The Characteristics of an Oceanic Type of Climate?|website=WorldAtlas|date=February 5, 2018|language=en|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref>

===Ecoregions===
[[File:Cascades panorama from the upper meadow below Park Butte.jpg|thumb|The Cascades range]]
Much of the Pacific Northwest is forested. The [[Georgia Strait]]–[[Puget Sound]] basin is shared between western British Columbia and Washington, and the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] ecoregion, which is the largest of the world's [[temperate rain forest]] [[ecoregion]]s in the system created by the [[World Wildlife Fund]], stretches along the coast from Alaska to California. The dry desert inland from the [[Cascade Range]] and [[Coast Mountains]] is very different from the terrain and climate of the coastal area due to the [[rain shadow effect]] of the mountains, and comprises the Columbia, Fraser and Thompson Plateaus and mountain ranges contained within them. The interior regions' climates largely within Eastern Washington, south central British Columbia, Eastern Oregon, and southern Idaho are a part of the [[Great Basin Desert]], although by their northern and eastern reaches, dry land and desert areas verge at the end of the Cascades' and [[Coast Mountains]]' [[rain shadow]]s with the boreal forest and various [[Alpine tundra|alpine flora regimes]] characteristic of eastern British Columbia, the [[Idaho Panhandle]] and western [[Montana]] roughly along a longitudinal line defined by the Idaho border with Washington and Oregon. The [[North American inland temperate rainforest]] is in the so-called interior wet-belt, approximately 500–700&nbsp;km inland from the pacific coast on western, windward mountain slopes and valley bottoms of the [[Columbia Mountains]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The interior wet-belt refers to a discontinuous band of humid forest patches, that are scattered over 1000&nbsp;km between [[Purden Lake Provincial Park|Purden Lake]] in Canada's [[British Columbia]] (54° North) and Montana and Idaho's [[Bitterroot Mountains]] and Idaho's [[Salmon River Mountains]] (45° North).<ref>Goward, Trevor; Spribille, Toby (2005). "Lichenological evidence for the recognition of inland rain forests in western North America". Journal of Biogeography. 32 (7): 1209-2010.</ref> It is closely associated with the [[North Central Rockies forests]] [[ecoregion]] designated by the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]], which extends over a similar range but incorporates various non-temperate rainforest ecosystems.

The overwhelming majority of the population of the Pacific Northwest is concentrated in the Portland–Seattle–Vancouver corridor. As of 2016, the combined populations of the [[Lower Mainland]] region (which includes the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District]]), the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], and the [[Portland metropolitan area]] totaled more than nine million people.<ref>{{cite web|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Lower Mainland--Southwest [Economic region], British Columbia and British Columbia [Province]|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=ER&Code1=5920&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&SearchText=Lower|access-date=2021-07-01|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Census profile: Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA Metro Area|url=http://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US42660-seattle-tacoma-bellevue-wa-metro-area/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=Census Reporter|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Census profile: Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA Metro Area|url=http://censusreporter.org/profiles/31000US38900-portland-vancouver-hillsboro-or-wa-metro-area/|access-date=2021-07-01|website=Census Reporter|language=en}}</ref> However, beyond these three cities, the PNW region is characterized by a very low density population distribution. Some other regions of greater population density outside this corridor include the Greater Victoria area and Greater Nanaimo area on Southern Vancouver Island (with a population of approximately 530,000),<ref>{{cite web|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Victoria [Census metropolitan area], British Columbia and British Columbia [Province]|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=935&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&SearchText=victoria&SearchType=Contains&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=0|access-date=2021-07-01|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Nanaimo, Regional district [Census division], British Columbia and Nanaimo [Population centre], British Columbia|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=5921&Geo2=POPC&Code2=0568&Data=Count&SearchText=Nanaimo&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1|access-date=2021-07-01|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca}}</ref> the Okanagan Valley in the British Columbia interior (about 350,000 people centered around the city of Kelowna, which has close to 200,000 people). Large geographical areas may only have one mid-sized to small-sized city as a regional center (often a county seat), with smaller cities and towns scattered around. Vast areas of the region may have little or no population at all, largely due to the presence of extensive mountains and forests, and plateaus containing both extensive farm and range lands, much of which is protected from development in large parks and preserves, or by zoning use regulation related to traditional land use. For example, all cities within the portion of California which are sometimes included some definitions of the "Pacific Northwest" have populations less than 100,000, with that portion of the state containing millions of acres of national forests and parks.

Beginning in the late 20th century, a general [[suburbanization]] of East and South Asian communities occurred in Vancouver, prompting concerns regarding the preservation of historical inner-city communities particularly in [[Chinatown]] and [[Punjabi Market]].

African Americans have held the positions of Mayor in Seattle; King County executive, while the state of Washington elected a [[Chinese American]] governor during the 1990s, [[Gary Locke (politician)|Gary Locke]].

British Columbians of many ethnicities are prominent in all levels of politics and government, and the province has a number of "firsts" in Canadian political history, including the first non-white and Asian [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]], [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] (who is [[Indo-Canadian]]) and the first Asian [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], the Hon. [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]]. The Lieutenant-Governor from 2007 to 2012, [[Steven Point]], was of aboriginal origin, being [[Stó:lō]] (the dominant type of [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] in BC's Lower Mainland) from the [[Chilliwack]] area. The leader of the opposition party from 2005 to 2011, the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]], was [[Carole James]], of partial [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] origin. Colonial governor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was himself [[mulatto]] of Guyanese extraction<!--Barbadian?--> and his wife was of [[Cree]] origin.

Oregon has been a national leader concerning [[LGBT]] representation in government. At the time of his election to the office of Portland mayor in 2008, [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] was the first openly gay individual to represent a city of Portland's size in the United States. In [[Silverton, Oregon]], the same year, [[Stu Rasmussen]] was elected the first [[transgender]] mayor in U.S. history. The first two LGBT state supreme court justices in the country both sit on the [[Oregon Supreme Court]]. At the time of her election, the previous [[Governor of Oregon]] [[Kate Brown]] was the highest-ranking openly [[bisexual]] politician in the United States. The current governor is [[Tina Kotek]], who became one of the first two openly lesbian women elected governor of a U.S. state after her election in 2022. In 2017, [[Jenny Durkan]] was elected as the first openly lesbian mayor of Seattle.

===Language===
Most Americans and Canadians consider the [[Pacific Northwest English]] accent "neutral", though distinct from the Midwestern dialects that some believe typify American speech.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Devlin | first=Thomas Moore | title=The United States Of Accents: Pacific Northwest English | website=Babbel Magazine | date=July 17, 2018 | url=https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/pacific-northwest-english/ | access-date=November 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | last=Kang | first=Martha | last2=Pailthorp | first2=Bellamy | title=Listen: Can You Pick Out The Northwest Accent?

[[Canadian raising]] occurs in British Columbia and some speakers in Washington to a similar degree as it does in [[southern Ontario]], but weaker than other parts of Canada. The [[California Vowel Shift]] also affects speech in the region.

[[Chinook Jargon]] was a [[pidgin]] or [[trade language]] established among [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous inhabitants of the region]]. After contact with Europeans, French, English, and [[Cree language|Cree]] words entered the language, and "eventually, Chinook became the lingua franca for as many as 250,000 people along the Pacific Slope from Alaska to Oregon".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2006/01/10/StillSpeakChinook/ |title=Can We Still Speak Chinook? |work=Thetyee.ca |date=January 10, 2006 |access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref> Chinook Jargon reached its height of usage in the 19th century, though remained common in resource and wilderness areas, particularly, but not exclusively, by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations in Canada|Canadian First Nations]] people, well into the 20th century. Today, its influence is felt mostly in [[place name]]s and a handful of localized [[slang]] terms, particularly the word ''[[skookum]]'', which remains hallmark of people raised in the region.

French was the [[voyageurs]]' working language of the early continental crossover exploration crews. The ensuing fur trade was dominated by French Canadian (and Métis) workers. The language held on South of the border in a few early settlements such as [[French Prairie]], [[Frenchtown, Washington|Frenchtown (Washington)]], [[Frenchtown, Montana|Frenchtown (Montana)]], [[Cowlitz Prairie]], and [[French Settlement, Oregon|French Settlement]]. These early settlements got resupplied through waves of new arrivals from the [[Oregon Trail]] attracted by the language and Catholics communities. Much of it ended up assimilating to the melting pot or sometimes folding into [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. New waves of French speaking workers came in later on to work in forestry and wood mills such as [[Maillardville]] in the [[greater Vancouver]] area. French remains much used in [[place name]]s, in the documentation of products intended for North America (along with Spanish and English), as well as an official language in Canada. French schooling is also popular in [[Western Canada]], including British Columbia.

Besides English and indigenous languages, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has been common since the [[gold rush]]es of the mid-19th century, most particularly in British Columbia. Since the 1980s the [[Taishanese|Toishan]], a [[Yue dialect]] predominant in the area, has been replaced by mainstream [[Cantonese]] and by [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] because of large-scale immigration from Asia. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is also common in British Columbia, specifically in Greater Vancouver and the [[Fraser Valley]] owing to the large [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] population in the region, first arriving in the late 19th century.<ref name=WaltonRobertsThreeReadingsp316>Walton-Roberts, Margaret. 1998.

Religion plays a smaller part in Pacific Northwest politics than in the rest of the United States. The [[Christian right|religious right]] has considerably less political influence than in other regions. Political conservatives in the Pacific Northwest tend to identify more strongly with free-market [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] values than they do with more religious [[social conservatives]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Vance |first=Chris |url=http://www.crosscut.com/politics-government/5511/ |title=Crosscut Seattle – Why Washington Republicans got creamed in 2006 and what they can do about it |work=[[Crosscut.com]] |date=July 24, 2007 |access-date=August 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729200355/http://www.crosscut.com/politics-government/5511/ |archive-date=July 29, 2012 }}</ref>

That said, three of the four major international [[charities]] in the region are religious in nature: [[World Concern]], [[World Vision International]], and [[Mercy Corps]]. This is part of a long tradition of activist religion. The [[Skid Road]] Group, a shelter offering soup and sermons to the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and recovering [[alcoholics]], was launched in Vancouver, with the [[Salvation Army]] having deep roots in the [[Gastown]] district, dating back to the era of the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1880s) and attained prominence in the same centers during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].

The region is also known as a magnet for a wide range of philosophical and spiritual belief systems. Eastern spiritual beliefs have been adopted by an unusually large number of people (by North American standards), and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] in particular has a strong local following.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/us/11seattle.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Dalai Lama Arrives for a Five-Day Conference in Seattle, Very Much His Kind of Town | first=William | last=Yardley | date=April 11, 2008 | access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> The Northwest Tibetan Cultural Association, claimed to be the largest organization of its kind in the world, was founded in Portland in 1993.

The region is home to many unique Christian communities, ranging from the [[Doukhobors]] to the [[Mennonites]]. The Mennonite Central Committee Supportive Care Services is based in the British Columbia city of Abbotsford.<ref>[http://www.mccscs.com/cms/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=display&ceid=9 Mennonite Central Committee Supportive Care Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819235828/http://www.mccscs.com/cms/index.php?module=ContentExpress&func=display&ceid=9 |date=August 19, 2006 }}</ref> The [[Mennonite Central Committee]] and the [[Mennonite Disaster Service]] enjoy a heavy rate of enlistment and donations from the strong Mennonite community in British Columbia's [[Fraser Valley]]. The Doukhobors, whose church is the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ, are a Russian [[Anabaptist]] sect whose migration to Canada was aided by Count [[Leo Tolstoy]], and who are today focused in the [[West Kootenay]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary]] regions of Southeastern British Columbia. Their history in Canada includes resistance to state education and industrial development (see [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]]). Also, within the region, there is a fairly strong representation of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches (Greek, Russian, Serbian, and others), as well as the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Oregon's [[Willamette Valley]] has a large population of [[Old Believers|Russian Old Believers]].<ref>[http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=764E6BED-FFC4-C034-9A5563F41CE37080 Oregon Historical Society article about Old Believers]. Retrieved February 9, 2007.</ref> Religious sees that are based in the Pacific Northwest include the Roman Catholic [[ecclesiastical province]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon|Portland]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle|Seattle]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[Province 8 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the Anglican [[Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon]], and the [[suffragan]] dioceses that make up those provinces.

Yogic teachings, Sufism, tribal and ancient beliefs and other philosophies are widely studied and appreciated in the region. The [[Lower Mainland]] of British Columbia has a very large [[Sikhism|Sikh]] community. Oregon has a considerable [[Quakers|Quaker]] ([[Society of Friends]]) population. There has been major growth in [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] temples since the increase in immigration from [[East Asia]] in the 1980s, especially in Vancouver.

Also in Vancouver, there is a small [[Hindu]] population, a number of Parsee ([[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]), and an emerging [[Islam|Muslim]], especially the 11,000-strong [[Ismaili]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Ismaili Success: Made in Vancouver| date=July 2, 2006| url=https://www.bcbusiness.ca/ismaili-success-made-in-vancouver}}</ref> population from [[South Asia]], the Middle East, Africa, the Balkans, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.

A major divide in political opinion separates the region's greatly more populated urban core and rural areas west of the mountains from its less populated rural areas to their east and (in British Columbia and Alaska) north.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/24/politics/main243670.shtml |title=Northwest Passage |work=CBS News |date=October 25, 2000 |access-date=August 18, 2010 |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510000830/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/24/politics/main243670.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> The coastal areas—especially in the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Portland, and Eugene—are some of the most politically liberal parts of North America, regularly supporting left-wing political candidates and causes by significant majorities. The religious right has much less influence throughout the region than elsewhere in the U.S. or in Western Canada. Certain areas of the British Columbia Interior, particularly the [[West Kootenay]], and some areas of Vancouver Island and the B.C. Coast, have long histories of [[History of British Columbia#Rise of the labour movement|labour]], environmental, and social activism.

The jurisdictions have relatively liberal [[abortion rights|abortion]] laws, gender equality laws, legal [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and strong [[LGBT rights]], especially British Columbia where these issues are of federal jurisdiction, and where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2003, Washington, where it has been legal since 2012, and Oregon, where same-sex marriage was made legal in May 2014. Oregon was the first U.S. state to legalize [[physician-assisted suicide]], with the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act|Death with Dignity Act]] of 1994. Washington State was the second when I-1000 passed in 2008. [[Colegio Cesar Chavez]], the first fully accredited Hispanic college in the U.S., was founded in [[Mount Angel, Oregon]], in 1973. In 1986, [[King County, Washington]], which contains Seattle, voted to change its namesake from [[William R. King]] to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brodeur |first1=Nicole |title='We were before our time': Remembering the fight to change King County's namesake from a slave owner to a civil-rights leader |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/we-were-before-our-time-remembering-the-fight-to-change-king-countys-namesake-from-a-slaveowner-to-a-civil-rights-leader/ |access-date=27 May 2020 |agency=The Seattle Times |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=20 January 2020}}</ref>

These areas, especially around Puget Sound, have a long history of political radicalism. The radical labor organizers called [[Wobblies]] were particularly strong there in the mines, [[lumber camp]]s and shipyards. A number of [[Anarchism|anarchist]] communes sprang up there in the early 20th&nbsp;century (see Charles Pierce LeWarne's ''Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885–1915'' for an overview of this movement). There are also pro gun socialist organizations such as [[Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club]]. Seattle is one of a handful of major cities in North America in which the populace engaged in a [[Seattle General Strike|general strike]] (in 1919), and was the first major American city to elect a woman mayor, [[Bertha Knight Landes]] (in 1926).<ref>[http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/about/precedingmayors.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629125846/http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/about/precedingmayors.htm|date=June 29, 2011}}</ref> [[Socialism|Socialist]] beliefs were once widespread (thanks in large part to the area's large numbers of Scandinavian immigrants), and the region has had a number of Socialist elected officials. So great was its influence that the U.S. Postmaster General, James Farley, jokingly toasted the "forty-seven states of the Union, and the Soviet of Washington", at a gala dinner in 1936 (although Farley denied ever saying it).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://depts.washington.edu/labhist/cpproject/ |title=Communism in Washington State – History and Memory Project |work=Depts.washington.edu |access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref>

Due to the Pacific Northwest being a generally liberal region, it also has a long history of feminism and people with feminist ideologies. The journey on the Oregon Trail may have been the part of the cause of feminism in the region, many women on the trail had to break gender-normative roles.<ref name=":0">Bledsoe, Jane L. "Adventuresome Women on the Oregon Trail: 1840-1867." ''Frontiers (Boulder)'' 7, no. 3 (1984): 22-29.</ref> Women occasionally were allowed the chance to try new things like cracking the whip for the wagon, given these opportunities women began to question their roles in society.<ref name=":0" /> Early days in the west, no forms of government had been established and this may have been part of the cause of feminist ideologies, new laws were formed to fit the regions needs and women were granted rights to land ownership in the West much earlier than in the East because of high death rates of men in the region.<ref>Matsuda, Mari J. "The West and the Legal State of Women: Explanations of Frontier Feminism." ''Journal of the West'' 24, no. 1 (1985): 47.</ref> While this may be coincidental, this granted women power. Women's suffrage movements were prominent in the Pacific Northwest; Susan B. Anthony did a tour through the region attempting to spread her ideas and made stops in Portland, the Willamette Valley, Columbia River, and Victoria.<ref>Beeton, Beverly, and Edwards, G. Thomas. "Susan B. Anthony's Woman Suffrage Crusade in the American West."

"Putting Feminism to a Vote: The Washington State Women's Council, 1963-78." ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly'' 91, no. 4 (2000): 171-82.</ref>

The region also has a long history of starting cooperative and communal businesses and organizations, including [[Group Health]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7531 |title=HistoryLink Essay: Group Health Cooperative – Part 1: Planting the Seeds, 1911–1945 |work=Historylink.org |date=November 13, 2005 |access-date=February 19, 2011}}</ref> [[Recreational Equipment, Inc.|REI]], [[Mountain Equipment Co-op|MEC]], [[Puget Consumers Co-op]], and numerous granges and mutual aid societies. It also has a long history of publicly owned power and utilities, with many of the region's cities owning their own [[public utility|public utilities]]. In British Columbia, [[credit union]]s are common and popular cooperatively owned financial institutions.

East of the Cascades, in Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon, the population is much more conservative. The eastern portions of Washington and especially Oregon, due to their low populations, do not generally have enough voting power to be competitive at the state level, and thus the governorships and U.S. Senate seats of both Oregon and Washington are usually held by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Conservatism in the eastern part of the Pacific Northwest tends to be distrustful of federal government interference in the market.

[[Aluminum smelting]] was once an important part of the region's economy due to the abundance of cheap hydroelectric power. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric power]] generated by the [[hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River]] powered at least ten aluminum smelters during the mid-20th century. By the end of World War II these smelters were producing over a third of the United States' aluminum. Production rose during the 1950s and 1960s, then declined. By the first decade of the 21st century the aluminum industry in the Pacific Northwest was essentially defunct.<ref>[http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Aluminum.asp Aluminum, Columbia River History], Northwest Power and Conservation Council</ref> The [[Alcan]] smelter at [[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] continues in operation and is fed by the diversion of the [[Nechako River]] (a tributary of the Fraser) to a powerhouse on the coast at [[Kemano]], near Kitimat.

The region as a whole, but especially several specific areas, are concentrated high-tech areas: Seattle eastern suburbs, the Portland [[Silicon Forest]] area, and Vancouver, British Columbia. These areas are also leading "[[creative class]]" economic drivers, feeding thriving cultural sectors, and include many knowledge workers and numerous international advertising, media, and design firms.

===Environmentalism===
[[Environmentalism]] is prominent throughout the region, especially west of the Cascades. Environmentally conscious services such as [[recycling]] and [[public transportation]] are widespread, most notably in the more populous areas. Politically, the Pacific Northwest is actively involved in environmental efforts. The international organization [[Greenpeace]] was born in Vancouver in 1970 as part of a large public opposition movement in British Columbia to US nuclear weapons testing on [[Amchitka Island]] in the Aleutian Islands. Liberal and conservative Northwesterners, such as former U.S. Senator [[Slade Gorton]] (R-WA) and moderate Democrats like former Speaker of the House [[Tom Foley]] (D-WA), have been prominent in the development of conservative approaches to environmental protection. Seattle in particular is also home to a large number of publications and institutions concerned with the environment and sustainability, including both ''[[Worldchanging]]'' and ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist.org]]'', the U.S.'s two largest online green magazines. The Pacific Northwest is also noted for a large number of gardening clubs, with Victoria having an annual flower count in February.

The direct-intervention oceanic protection group known as the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] has its headquarters in [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]] on [[San Juan Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/sound/article/Anti-whaling-boat-owned-by-San-Juan-s-Sea-896937.php |title=Anti-whaling boat owned by San Juan's Sea Shepherd Society takes on water near Antarctica |date=January 6, 2010 |work=Journal of the San Juans |access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref>

In British Columbia, environmentalists fought to protect [[Clayoquot Sound]] in the 1980s and 1990s. More recently the province has agreed to environmental protections in the [[Great Bear Rainforest]].

===Music===
{{main|Music of the Pacific Northwest}}
The modern-era Pacific Northwest is known for [[indie (music)|indie music]], especially [[grunge]], [[alternative rock]], and [[heavy metal music|metal]]; the region also has [[folk music]] and [[world music]] traditions and has lately gained notice for its [[Hip hop music in the Pacific Northwest|hip hop scene]]. Many acts are associated with the independent label [[Sub Pop]]. [[KEXP]].org is a popular Seattle-based public indie music radio station known across the country. Among the Northwest's largest music festivals are the [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]], the [[Vancouver Folk Music Festival]], the [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]] in [[George, Washington]], Seattle's [[Bumbershoot]], Boise's [[Treefort Music Fest]], and Portland's [[MusicfestNW]]. Portland's Waterfront Blues Festival is the largest blues-based festival west of the Mississippi River.

Among the most notable rock artists originating from the region are [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[The Decemberists]], and [[Sleater-Kinney]]. The history of Northwest rock, however, finds its roots in the mid-1950s and 1960s with such bands as [[The Sonics]], [[The Ventures]], [[The Kingsmen]], and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders|Paul Revere and the Raiders]].<ref>''"Louie Louie" and the History of Northwest Rock and Radio''.

Ethnic staples ranging from frozen [[pierogi]] or [[samosas]] to frozen [[spring rolls]] or [[dim sum]] are common in most supermarkets in these communities.

Locally-made craft beers, ciders, and premium wines from various wine-growing areas within the region are popular with drinkers and diners. Northern latitude and coastal breezes create a climate that attracts international recognition for its mostly family-owned and operated vineyards and wineries.

Portland is a major microbrewery center in America,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/travel/10Portland.html | work=The New York Times | title=Frugal Portland | first=Matt | last=Gross | date=May 10, 2009 | access-date=May 20, 2010}}</ref> and is home to [[List of Oregon breweries|numerous breweries]].

===Sports===

Skiing, snowboarding, cycling, mountaineering, hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, boating, and [[water sports]] are popular outdoor activities. Vancouver, Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Boise and Victoria are home to numerous professional sports teams, including the [[Abbotsford Canucks]], [[BC Bears]], [[BC Lions]], [[Eugene Emeralds]], [[Everett AquaSox]], [[Everett Silvertips]], [[Fraser Valley Bandits]], [[Hillsboro Hops]], [[Seattle Reign FC]], [[Portland Thorns FC]], [[Portland Timbers (MLS)|Portland Timbers]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Portland Winterhawks]], [[Salem-Keizer Volcanoes]], [[Seattle Dragons]], [[Seattle Mariners]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Seattle Seawolves]], [[Seattle Sounders FC]], [[Seattle Storm]], [[Seattle Thunderbirds]], [[Seattle Kraken]], [[Pacific FC]], [[Tacoma Defiance]], [[Tacoma Rainiers]], [[Tri City Americans]], [[Vancouver Canadians]], [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Vancouver Warriors]], [[Vancouver Giants]], [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]], [[Boise Hawks]], [[Idaho Steelheads]], [[Idaho Horsemen]], [[Idaho Falls Chukars]]  and [[Victoria Royals]].

The region's three USSF Division 1 [[Major League Soccer]] teams the Whitecaps FC, Sounders FC, and Timbers play to sold-out crowds and compete annually for the [[Cascadia Cup]]. The USSF Division 4 [[USL Premier Development League]] also has seven teams in the Northwest Division. In addition to all this, the region has its own representative non-FIFA team which joined the [[N.F.-Board]] officially in 2013 to participate in friendlies and the [[VIVA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Non-FIFA Cascadia National Team officially approved by NF-Board |url=https://cascadiaunderground.org/non-fifa-cascadia-national-team-officially-accepted-by-nf-board/ |website=Cascadia Underground |date=July 26, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, the [[Cascadia Association Football Federation]] competed in the [[2018 ConIFA World Football Cup]] representing the Pacific Northwest.

Vancouver is home to a 4-team league for [[Australian football]], the British Columbia Australian Football League, one of several [[Australian rules football in Canada|Canadian Australian football leagues]].

Hockey is the most popular spectator sport in British Columbia, with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[NHL]] being the most popular professional team, although the [[Vancouver Giants]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] also have a very strong following. The [[Canadian Football League]]'s BC Lions are considered Vancouver's second most popular team, although [[major league soccer]]'s Vancouver Whitecaps FC have been rising in popularity in recent years. Hockey is slowly gaining popularity south of the border too, with the [[Everett Silvertips]], [[Portland Winterhawks]], and [[Seattle Thunderbirds]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] and the [[Seattle Kraken]] of the [[NHL]].

Followers of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team refer to themselves as the ''Sixth Man'' and ''Blazermania'' refers to the extraordinary dedication fans have shown the team. In Seattle, many fans are still upset over the move of the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] while supporters of the Seattle Seahawks football team are known officially as the 12th Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seahawks.com/fans/12zone/spirit-of-12.html |title=Spirit of 12 |work=Seahawks.com |access-date=August 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209192030/http://seahawks.com/fans/12zone/spirit-of-12.html |archive-date=February 9, 2009 }}</ref> And the [[supporter groups]], (namely the [[Emerald City Supporters]], [[Timbers Army]], and [[Vancouver Southsiders]]) of the three MLS teams of the region are renowned for their passion and dedication to their teams.

The only major track for motorsports in the Pacific Northwest region is [[Portland International Raceway]]. PIR currently hosts the NTT [[IndyCar Series]] and its [[Road to Indy]] ladder series', as well as the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]]; the number two stock car series in the country.

In Idaho, Washington and Oregon, many residents passionately follow [[college athletics]]. In Washington, the major [[NCAA Division I]] college athletic programs are the [[University of Washington Huskies]] and the [[Washington State Cougars]]. In Oregon, the major programs are the [[University of Oregon Ducks]] and the [[Oregon State Beavers]]. All four of these programs are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and compete with each other in a variety of sports. These universities are all considered rivals of one another, particularly in [[college football]]. The most significant of these rivalries are the [[Oregon–Washington football rivalry]] game, the Washington-Washington State game known as the [[Apple Cup]] due to Washington's notoriety for apple production and the [[Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry]]. As in professional sports, college fans in the Pacific Northwest are known for being particularly passionate about their teams. Both [[Husky Stadium]] (where the Washington Huskies play football) and [[Autzen Stadium]] (where the Oregon Ducks play football) have gained reputations for deafening noise, despite not being the largest of college football venues. Husky Stadium currently holds the record for the loudest crowd noise in NCAA history at 130 [[decibels]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gohuskies.com/facilities/husky-stadium.html|title=Washington Huskies|website=Washington Huskies|access-date=October 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511015022/http://www.gohuskies.com/facilities/husky-stadium.html|archive-date=May 11, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> while Autzen Stadium currently holds the record for the 4th at 127 decibels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/j-brady-mccollough-duck-duck-lose|title=- The Michigan Daily|date=September 21, 2003}}</ref> In Idaho, the major [[NCAA Division I]] college athletic programs are the [[Boise State Broncos]], the [[Idaho Vandals]] and the [[Idaho State Bengals]], the latter two being members of the [[Football Championship Subdivision]] in the [[Big Sky Conference]] while Boise State competes in the [[Mountain West Conference]] of the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]]. Boise State and Idaho enjoyed a healthy rivalry from the 1970s through the late 2000s with each team having significant win streaks in the series over the other, Boise State had the most recent streak with 12 consecutive wins starting in 1999 which was preceded by Idaho's most recent win streak of 12 consecutive wins from 1982 to 1993. In 2018, Idaho rekindled an old rivalry with Idaho State that had been dormant since 1996 when Idaho moved up to FBS. Idaho currently has the lead in the [[Battle of the Domes]]  series 29–13.

===Video games===
Seattle is considered by ''Digital Trends'' magazine to be the top gaming city in America, a possible indicator of markedly higher rates of video game usage throughout the Pacific Northwest in general.<ref name=vg>{{cite news|url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/article10268.html|work=Digital Trends|title=Seattle Top Gaming City?|date=May 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007131133/http://news.digitaltrends.com/article10268.html|archive-date=October 7, 2008}}</ref> A number of major companies are headquartered in the Seattle metropolitan area, including [[Microsoft]], [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], [[Bungie]], [[Nintendo of America]] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Nintendo]]), and [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s subsidiary [[Sucker Punch Productions]]. Microsoft and Nintendo of America also have Canadian branches headquartered in Vancouver—Microsoft Canada and Nintendo of Canada—respectively, while [[EA Vancouver]] (a subsidiary division of [[Electronic Arts]]) is in the same city.

===Self-determination movements===
Among the fiercely independent and frontier nature of the former Oregon Country and now western part of the United States, is the desire of some Pacific Northwesterners to improve upon their form of democracy by further subdividing the region into [[socio-political]] or [[bioregion]] defined [[nation state]]s. Some desires are [[transnationality|transnational]] and autonomous of the United States while others are in the hope of gaining additional representational control in particular regions of the Northwest. Among these fluidly changing geographical boundaries and areas sought by a segment of the population of the Northwest are the following Pacific Northwest proposed states and [[separatist movement]]s:

*[[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]]
*[[Jefferson (proposed Pacific state)|Jefferson]]
*[[Lincoln (proposed Northwestern state)|Lincoln]]
*[[Northwest Territorial Imperative|Northwest Territory]]
