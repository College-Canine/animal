The '''Poodle''', called the {{lang|de|Pudel}} in German ({{IPA-de|ˈpuːdl̩|lang|De-Pudel.ogg}}) and the {{lang|fr|Caniche}} in French, is a [[Dog breed|breed]] of [[water dog]]. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the '''Standard Poodle''', '''Medium Poodle''', '''Miniature Poodle''' and '''Toy Poodle''', although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10–18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.

The Poodle likely originated in [[Germany]], although the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (FCI, International Canine Federation) and a minority of [[cynology|cynologists]] believe it originated in [[France]]. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by [[wildfowl]] hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the [[Kennel Club of the United Kingdom]] and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) soon after the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and [[dog show|show dogs]] – Poodles were the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.

== History ==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - A poodle, after Matham.jpg|thumb|right|A 17th-century engraving of a Poodle]]
Most cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the [[Middle Ages]], from a dog similar to today's Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany's [[water dog]], just as England had the [[English Water Spaniel]], France the [[Barbet (dog)|Barbet]], Ireland the [[Irish Water Spaniel]] and the Netherlands the [[Wetterhoun]].{{r|Alderton-87|Alderton-08|Fogle|Hancock|Morris}} Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or "Pudel" in German, which is derived from the [[Low German]] word "puddeln", meaning "to splash". Numerous works by various German artists from as early as the 17th century depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type.{{r|Alderton-87|Alderton-08|Fogle|Morris}} Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in [[France]], where it is known as the "Caniche" and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (FCI, International Canine Federation).{{r|FCI|Fiorone}} Others argue that the breed originated in [[Russia]], [[Piedmont]] or [[Northwest Africa]].{{r|Hancock|Fiorone}}

Whatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost [[arrow]]s and [[Crossbow bolt|bolts]] that had missed their mark.{{r|Fogle|Hancock}}

=== Size variants {{anchor|Size varieties}} ===
Due to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.{{r|Alderton-08|Fogle|Morris|Fiorone}} In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.{{r|Morris}} As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.{{r|Alderton-08|Fogle|Morris}}

The Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred Miniature Poodles down in size to create a popular companion dog.{{r|Alderton-08|Fogle|Morris}} Initially, these efforts resulted in disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original.{{r|Alderton-08|Fogle|Morris}} Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.{{r|Morris}}

The last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world's [[kennel club]]s, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs.{{r|Fogle|Morris|FCI}} One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at [[conformation show]]s.{{r|Morris}}

=== Recent history ===
The Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Pedersen |first1=N.

==== Coat ====
Poodles have thick, curly coats with harsh fur. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every four to eight weeks.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Guidry |first=Virginia Parker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ug0JzeJ0zK8C&dq=poodle+temperament&pg=PT20 |title=Your Poodle's Life: Your Complete Guide to Raising Your Pet from Puppy to Companion |date=2010-05-05 |publisher=Crown |isbn=978-0-307-54998-3 |language=en}}</ref>

Poodles are often cited as a [[hypoallergenic dog breed]]. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of [[dander]] and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual Poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. However, researchers have generally not found a difference in allergens across breeds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholas|first1=Charlotte E.|last2=Wegienka|first2=Ganesa R.|last3=Havstad|first3=Suzanne L.|last4=Zoratti|first4=Edward M.|last5=Ownby|first5=Dennis R.|last6=Johnson|first6=Christine Cole|date=2011|title=Dog allergen levels in homes with hypoallergenic compared with nonhypoallergenic dogs|journal=American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy|volume=25|issue=4|pages=252–256|doi=10.2500/ajra.2011.25.3606|issn=1945-8924|pmc=3680143|pmid=21819763}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=5 February 1997|title=Nonallergenic Dog?

====Clips and grooming ====
[[File:CH Renaissance Hopeful Impulse.jpg|thumb|150px|Miniature Poodle with a Continental clip]]
The FCI and AKC allows Poodles to be shown in the Puppy, Continental (Lion in the FCI standard), English Saddle, or Sporting (Modern) clip. The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="FCI_Standard" /> The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips.<ref name="AKC">{{cite web |title=Poodle |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle/ |access-date=7 February 2021 |publisher=American Kennel Club}}</ref><ref name=":4"/> A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered.<ref name="Flaim" /> Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip —evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.<ref name="AKC" />

In most cases, whether a Poodle is in a pet or show clip, the hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be "corded" with rope-like mats similar to those of a [[Komondor]] or human [[dreadlocks]]. Though once as common as the curly Poodle, corded Poodles are now rare. [[Cording (dog grooming)|Corded coats]] are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zsolt |date=2015-07-09 |title=How to Cord a Poodle Coat |url=https://www.doggroomingtutorial.com/how-to-cord-a-poodle-coat/ |access-date=2022-11-24 |website=Dog Grooming Tutorial |language=en-US}}</ref> Corded Poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.<ref name="FCI"/><ref name="UKC">{{cite web|url=http://mail.ukcdogs.com/UKCweb.nsf/80de88211ee3f2dc8525703f004ccb1e/77cc12b9230c0541852570490044c05a?OpenDocument|title=United Kennel Club: Standard Poodle Breed Standard.

The Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, [[Café au Lait|café au lait]], silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, [[Sable (dog)|sable]], [[brindle]] and phantom.<ref name="AKCInfo">{{Cite web|title=Poodle Dog Breed Information|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle-standard/|access-date=2022-02-20|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Breed Standards : Multi-Colored Standard Poodle {{!}} United Kennel Club (UKC) |url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/multi-colored-standard-poodle |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=www.ukcdogs.com}}</ref> Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, and fawn.<ref name="FCI_Standard">{{Cite web|orig-date=January 23, 2015|title=FCI-Standard N° 172 - Poodle (Caniche)|url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/172g09-en.pdf|website=[[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]]}}</ref> Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry.

=== Temperament ===
Poodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A [[The Intelligence of Dogs|1994 book]] by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in "working and obedience intelligence", a measure of their ability to learn from humans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|url=https://archive.org/details/intelligenceofdo00core|title=The intelligence of dogs : a guide to the thoughts, emotions, and inner lives or our canine companions|date=1994|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-8087-7|edition=|location=New York|oclc=61461866}}</ref> Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=AKC Breed Standard|url=https://poodleclubofamerica.org/akc-breed-standard/|access-date=2022-02-20|website=The Poodle Club of America|language=en-US}}</ref>

Poodles suffer from a number of hereditary diseases. The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles.<ref name=":0" /> Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease [[sebaceous adenitis]] (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and [[Addison's disease in canines|Addison’s disease]], an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Pedersen |first1=Niels C. |last2=Brucker |first2=Lynn |last3=Tessier |first3=Natalie Green |last4=Liu |first4=Hongwei |last5=Penedo |first5=Maria Cecilia T. |last6=Hughes |first6=Shayne |last7=Oberbauer |first7=Anita |last8=Sacks |first8=Ben |date=2015-08-27 |title=The effect of genetic bottlenecks and inbreeding on the incidence of two major autoimmune diseases in standard poodles, sebaceous adenitis and Addison's disease |journal=Canine Genetics and Epidemiology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=14 |doi=10.1186/s40575-015-0026-5 |issn=2052-6687 |pmc=4579369 |pmid=26401342 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=":0" /> One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling [[village dog]]s.<ref name=":3" />

Poodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the [[English Civil War]], [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] had a famous [[Boy (dog)|hunting Poodle]] who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier's pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the [[Battle of Marengo]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxEHZ_fPVEEC&q=bonaparte+poodle+battle+of+marengo&pg=PA17|title=Canine Commandos: The Heroism, Devotion, and Sacrifice of Dogs in War|last=Cawthorne|first=Nigel|date=2012|publisher=Ulysses Press|isbn=978-1-61243-055-3}}</ref>
