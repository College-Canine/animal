<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Ventricular tachycardia''' ('''V-tach''' or '''VT''') is a [[cardiovascular disorder]] in which [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] occurs in the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] of the [[heart]].<ref name=NIH2011/> Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm.<ref name=NIH2011>{{cite web|title=Types of Arrhythmia|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr/types|website=NHLBI|access-date=7 September 2016|date=July 1, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607165144/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr/types|archive-date=7 June 2015}}</ref><ref>Eifling M, Razavi M, Massumi A.

Ventricular tachycardia may result in [[ventricular fibrillation]] (VF) and turn into [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=Bal2016 /><ref name=NIH2011 /> This conversion of the VT into VF is called the degeneration of the VT. It is found initially in about 7% of people in cardiac arrest.<ref name=Bal2016 />

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to [[coronary heart disease]], [[aortic stenosis]], [[cardiomyopathy]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], or a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref name=Bal2016 /><ref name=NIH2011 /> Diagnosis is by an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) showing a rate of greater than 120 beats per minute and at least three wide [[QRS complex]]es in a row.<ref name=Bal2016 /> It is classified as non-sustained versus sustained based on whether it lasts less than or more than 30 seconds.<ref name=Bal2016 /> The term ventricular arrhythmia refers to the group of abnormal cardiac rhythms originating from the ventricle, which includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and [[torsades de pointes]].<ref name=Bal2016>{{cite journal|last1=Baldzizhar|first1=A|last2=Manuylova|first2=E|last3=Marchenko|first3=R|last4=Kryvalap|first4=Y|last5=Carey|first5=MG|title=Ventricular Tachycardias: Characteristics and Management|journal=Critical Care Nursing Clinics of North America|date=September 2016|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–329|pmid=27484660|doi=10.1016/j.cnc.2016.04.004}}</ref>

<!-- Treatment and prognosis -->
In those who have normal [[blood pressure]] and strong [[pulse]], the [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]] medication [[procainamide]] may be used.<ref name="Bal2016" /> Otherwise, immediate [[cardioversion]] is recommended, preferably with a biphasic DC shock of 200 joules.<ref name="Bal2016" /> In those in cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]] is recommended.<ref name="AHA2015Part1" /> Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic.<ref name="AHA2015Part1" /> While waiting for a defibrillator, a [[precordial thump]] may be attempted (However reserved to those who have the prior experience of doing so) in those on a [[heart monitor]] who are seen going into an unstable ventricular tachycardia.<ref name="AHA2015Part1">{{cite journal|last1=Neumar|first1=RW|last2=Shuster|first2=M|last3=Callaway|first3=CW|last4=Gent|first4=LM|last5=Atkins|first5=DL|last6=Bhanji|first6=F|last7=Brooks|first7=SC|last8=de Caen|first8=AR|last9=Donnino|first9=MW|last10=Ferrer|first10=JM|last11=Kleinman|first11=ME|last12=Kronick|first12=SL|last13=Lavonas|first13=EJ|last14=Link|first14=MS|last15=Mancini|first15=ME|last16=Morrison|first16=LJ|last17=O'Connor|first17=RE|last18=Samson|first18=RA|last19=Schexnayder|first19=SM|last20=Singletary|first20=EM|last21=Sinz|first21=EH|last22=Travers|first22=AH|last23=Wyckoff|first23=MH|last24=Hazinski|first24=MF|title=Part 1: Executive Summary: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=3 November 2015|volume=132|issue=18 Suppl 2|pages=S315–367|pmid=26472989|quote=In the appendix|doi=10.1161/cir.0000000000000252|doi-access=free}}</ref> In those with cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, survival is about 75%.<ref name="Bal2016" /> An [[implantable cardiac defibrillator]] or medications such as [[calcium channel blockers]] or [[amiodarone]] may be used to prevent recurrence.<ref name="Bal2016" />

==Signs and symptoms==
While a few seconds may not result in problems, longer periods are dangerous.<ref name=NIH2011/> Short periods may occur without symptoms or present with lightheadedness, [[palpitations]], [[shortness of breath]], [[chest pain]], or [[unconsciousness]].<ref name=Bal2016/> Ventricular tachycardia may turn into [[ventricular fibrillation]] and can result in [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=Bal2016/><ref name=NIH2011/>

==Cause==
Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to [[coronary heart disease]], [[aortic stenosis]], [[cardiomyopathy]], [[electrolyte problems]] (e.g., [[hypomagnesemia|low blood levels of magnesium]] or [[hypokalemia|potassium]]), inherited [[channelopathies]] (e.g., [[long-QT syndrome]]), [[catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]], [[arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia]], alcohol withdrawal syndrome (typically following [[atrial fibrillation]]), or a [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name=Bal2016/><ref name=NIH2011/>

==Pathophysiology==

The morphology of the tachycardia depends on its cause and the origin of the re-entry electrical circuit in the heart.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, the shape of each heart beat on the ECG looks the same because the impulse is either being generated from increased [[Cardiac arrhythmia#Automaticity|automaticity]] of a single point in either the left or the right ventricle, or due to a [[cardiac dysrhythmia#Re-entry|reentry]] circuit within the ventricle. The most common cause of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is [[myocardial scarring|scarring of the heart muscle]] from a previous [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack). This scar cannot conduct electrical activity, so there is a potential circuit ''around'' the scar that results in the tachycardia. This is similar to the re-entrant circuits that are the cause of [[atrial flutter]] and the re-entrant forms of [[supraventricular tachycardia]]. Other rarer congenital causes of monomorphic VT include right ventricular dysplasia, and right and left ventricular outflow tract VT.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, is most commonly caused by abnormalities of ventricular muscle repolarization. The predisposition to this problem usually manifests on the ECG as a prolongation of the QT interval. QT prolongation may be congenital or acquired. Congenital problems include [[long QT syndrome]] and [[catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]]. Acquired problems are usually related to drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities, but can occur as a result of myocardial ischemia. Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs such as [[sotalol]] and [[amiodarone]] prolong the QT interval and may in some circumstances be pro-arrhythmic. Other relatively common drugs including some antibiotics and antihistamines may also be a danger, in particular in combination with one another. Problems with blood levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium may also contribute. High-dose magnesium is often used as an antidote in cardiac arrest protocols.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Diagnosis==
The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of ventricular tachycardia is made based on the rhythm seen on either a 12-lead ECG or a telemetry rhythm strip. It may be very difficult to differentiate between ventricular tachycardia and a wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia in some cases. In particular, supraventricular tachycardias with aberrant conduction from a pre-existing [[bundle branch block]] are commonly misdiagnosed as ventricular tachycardia. Other rarer phenomena include [[ashman phenomenon|Ashman beats]] and [[AV reentrant tachycardia|antidromic atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Various diagnostic criteria have been developed to determine whether a wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia or a more benign rhythm.<ref name="Wellens-1978">{{cite journal|vauthors=Wellens HJ, Bär FW, Lie KI |title=The value of the electrocardiogram in the differential diagnosis of a tachycardia with a widened QRS complex |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |date=January 1978 |pmid=623134 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(78)90176-6}}</ref><ref name="Brugada-1991">{{cite journal|vauthors=Brugada P, Brugada J, Mont L, Smeets J, Andries EW |title=A new approach to the differential diagnosis of a regular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex |journal=Circulation |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=1649–59 |date=May 1991 |pmid=2022022 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.83.5.1649|doi-access=free}}</ref> In addition to these diagnostic criteria, if the individual has a history of a [[myocardial infarction]], [[congestive heart failure]], or recent [[Angina pectoris|angina]], the wide complex tachycardia is much more likely to be ventricular tachycardia.<ref name="Baerman-1987">{{cite journal|vauthors=Baerman JM, Morady F, DiCarlo LA, de Buitleir M |title=Differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with aberration: value of the clinical history |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=40–3 |date=January 1987 |pmid=3800075 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(87)80283-4}}</ref>

The proper diagnosis is important, as the misdiagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia when ventricular tachycardia is present is associated with worse prognosis. This is particularly true if [[calcium channel blocker]]s, such as [[verapamil]], are used to attempt to terminate a presumed supraventricular tachycardia.<ref name="Stewart-1986">{{cite journal|vauthors=Stewart RB, Bardy GH, Greene HL |title=Wide complex tachycardia: misdiagnosis and outcome after emergent therapy |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=104 |issue=6 |pages=766–71 |date=June 1986 |pmid=3706928 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-104-6-766}}</ref> Therefore, it is wisest to assume that all wide complex tachycardia is VT until proven otherwise.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

'''ECG features of Ventricular Tachycardia in addition to the increased Heart rate are:'''

# A '''wide QRS Complex''' (because the ectopics for the generation of the cardiac impulse originates in the Ventricular Myocyte and propagated via the intermyocyte conduction, which is a delayed conduction)
# A '''Josephson's sign''' where there is the notch in the downsloping of the S wave near its nadir (considered very specific for the VT).
# '''Capture beats''' (normal QRS complex in between when the Heart pick up the  sinus rhythm from the impulses generated by the SA node), fusion '''beats''' (due to the fusion of the Abnormal and the Normal QRS complexes) which has a unique morphology.
# Positive or negative concordance.
# Extreme [[Cardiac axis|Axis deviation]] or NORTH WEST axis (axis between -90 and +180 degrees)

===Classification===
{{Anchor|Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia}}
[[File:Ventricular Tachycardia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Normal [[Sinus rhythm|sinus]] top, ventricular tachycardia bottom]]
[[Image:Electrocardiogram of Ventricular Tachycardia.png|thumb|upright=1.3|12 lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing a run of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)]]
Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its ''morphology'':{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
* Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG).
** Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a heart attack, especially if they have [[heart failure|weak heart muscle]].<ref name="John2012"/>
** [[Right ventricular outflow tract]] (RVOT) tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the [[right ventricular outflow tract]]. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
** The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a [[right bundle branch block]] morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a [[left bundle branch block]] morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum.<ref name="John2012">{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=RM|last2=Tedrow|first2=UB|last3=Koplan|first3=BA|last4=Albert|first4=CM|last5=Epstein|first5=LM|last6=Sweeney|first6=MO|last7=Miller|first7=AL|last8=Michaud|first8=GF|last9=Stevenson|first9=WG|title=Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death|journal=Lancet|date=October 2012|volume=380|issue=9852|pages=1520–9|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61413-5|pmid=23101719|s2cid=11558991}}</ref>
* Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name ''[[torsades de pointes]]'' ("twisting of the spikes"). However, at the current time, the term ''torsades de pointes'' is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting [[QT interval]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the ''duration of the episodes'': Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
* If the fast rhythm self-terminates within 30 seconds, it is considered a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
* If the rhythm lasts more than 30 seconds, it is known as a sustained ventricular tachycardia (even if it terminates on its own after 30 seconds).

A third way to classify ventricular tachycardia is on the basis of its ''symptoms'': Pulseless VT is associated with no effective cardiac output, hence, no effective pulse, and is a cause of cardiac arrest (see also: [[pulseless electrical activity]] [PEA]). In this circumstance, it is best treated the same way as ventricular fibrillation (VF), and is recognized as one of the [[shockable rhythm]]s on the cardiac arrest protocol. Some VT is associated with reasonable cardiac output and may even be asymptomatic. The heart usually tolerates this rhythm poorly in the medium to long term, and patients may certainly deteriorate to pulseless VT or to VF.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Occasionally in ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular impulses are conducted to the ventricles, generating QRS complexes with normal or aberrant supraventricular morphology (ventricular capture). Or, those impulses can be merged with complexes that are originated in the ventricle and produce a summation pattern (fusion complexes).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Answer to diagnostic dilemma: EKG |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |date=15 April 2000 |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=512–3 |pmid=10781791 |url=http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(00)00373-9/pdf |doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(00)00373-9|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Less common is ventricular tachycardia that occurs in individuals with structurally normal hearts. This is known as ''idiopathic ventricular tachycardia'' and in the monomorphic form coincides with little or no increased risk of sudden cardiac death. In general, ''idiopathic ventricular tachycardia'' occurs in younger individuals diagnosed with VT. While the causes of idiopathic VT are not known, in general it is presumed to be congenital, and can be brought on by any number of diverse factors.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==Treatment==
Therapy may be directed either at terminating an episode of the abnormal heart rhythm or at reducing the risk of another VT episode. The treatment for stable VT is tailored to the specific person, with regard to how well the individual tolerates episodes of ventricular tachycardia, how frequently episodes occur, their comorbidities, and their wishes. Individuals with pulseless VT or unstable VT are hemodynamically compromised and require immediate electric [[cardioversion]] to shock them out of the VT rhythm.<ref>Kasper, D. (2012). "The Tachyarrhythmias". In ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine'' (18th ed., Vol. 2, pp. 1892–1893). New York: McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division.</ref>

===Cardioversion===
If a person still has a pulse, it is usually possible to terminate the episode using electric cardioversion.<ref name=Link2010/> This should be synchronized to the heartbeat if the waveform is monomorphic if possible, in order to avoid degeneration of the rhythm to [[ventricular fibrillation]].<ref name=Link2010/> An initial energy of 100J is recommended.<ref name=Link2010>{{cite journal|last1=Link|first1=MS|last2=Atkins|first2=DL|last3=Passman|first3=RS|last4=Halperin|first4=HR|last5=Samson|first5=RA|last6=White|first6=RD|last7=Cudnik|first7=MT|last8=Berg|first8=MD|last9=Kudenchuk|first9=PJ|last10=Kerber|first10=RE|title=Part 6: electrical therapies: automated external defibrillators, defibrillation, cardioversion, and pacing: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=2 November 2010|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S706–719|pmid=20956222|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970954|doi-access=free}}</ref> If the waveform is polymorphic, then higher energies and an unsynchronized shock should be provided (also known as defibrillation).<ref name=Link2010/>

===Defibrillation===
A person with pulseless VT is treated the same as ventricular fibrillation with high-energy (360J with a monophasic defibrillator, or 200J with a biphasic defibrillator) unsynchronised cardioversion ([[defibrillation]]).<ref name=Link2010/> They will be unconscious.

The shock may be delivered to the outside of the chest using the two pads of an external defibrillator, or internally to the heart by an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD) if one has previously been inserted.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

An ICD may also be set to attempt to overdrive pace the ventricle. Pacing the ventricle at a rate faster than the underlying tachycardia can sometimes be effective in terminating the rhythm. If this fails after a short trial, the ICD will usually stop pacing, charge up and deliver a defibrillation grade shock.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Medication===
For those who are stable with a [[monomorphic waveform]] the medications [[procainamide]] or [[sotalol]] may be used and are better than [[lidocaine]].<ref name=EM2015/> Evidence does not show that [[amiodarone]] is better than procainamide.<ref name=EM2015>{{cite journal|last1=deSouza|first1=IS|last2=Martindale|first2=JL|last3=Sinert|first3=R|title=Antidysrhythmic drug therapy for the termination of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: a systematic review|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|date=February 2015|volume=32|issue=2|pages=161–167|pmid=24042252|doi=10.1136/emermed-2013-202973|hdl=20.500.12648/8174 |s2cid=28413164|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

As a [[hypomagnesemia|low magnesium level in the blood]] is a common cause of VT, magnesium sulfate can be given for torsades de pointes or if a low blood magnesium level is found/suspected.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy may be indicated to prevent recurrence of VT. Beta-blockers and a number of class III anti-arrhythmics are commonly used, such as the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol, and the Potassium-Channel-Blockers amiodarone, dronedarone, bretylium, sotalol, ibutilide, and dofetilide. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists are also sometimes used in this setting.<ref>Compton, Steven J. MD, FACC, FACP, FHRS https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/159075-overview Ret. Nov. 17 2017.</ref>

===Invasive treatment===
An [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|ICD]] (implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) is more effective than drug therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death due to VT and VF, but does not prevent these rhythm from happening.

[[Ablation#Medicine|Catheter ablation]] is a potentially definitive treatment option for those with recurrent VT.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Aliot EM, Stevenson WG, Almendral-Garrote JM, etal |title=EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias: developed in a partnership with the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), a Registered Branch of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS); in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) |journal=Europace |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=771–817 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19443434 |doi=10.1093/europace/eup098|doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Remote magnetic navigation]] is one effective method to do the procedure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Akca|first1=F|last2=Önsesveren|first2=I|last3=Jordaens|first3=L|last4=Szili-Torok|first4=T|title=Safety and efficacy of the remote magnetic navigation for ablation of ventricular tachycardias--a systematic review|journal=Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology |date=June 2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=65–71|pmid=22180126|doi=10.1007/s10840-011-9645-2|pmc=3342497}}</ref>

In the past, ablation was often not considered until pharmacological options had been exhausted, often after the patient had developed substantial morbidity from recurrent episodes of VT and ICD shocks. Antiarrhythmic medications can reduce the frequency of ICD therapies, but have efficacy varies and side effects can be significant. Advances in technology and understanding of VT substrates now allow ablation of multiple and unstable VTs with acceptable safety and efficacy, even in patients with advanced heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wissner E, Stevenson WG, Kuck KH |title=Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy: where are we today?
