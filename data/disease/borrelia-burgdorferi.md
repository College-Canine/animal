''Borrelia burgdorferi'' is a microaerophile, requiring small amounts of oxygen in order to undergo glycolysis and survive. Like all other ''Borrelia'' sps., this bacterium is also gram-negative and a spirochete. Borrelia colonies are often smaller, rounded, and white with an elevated center.<ref name=":0" /> ''B. burgdorferi'' possesses [[flagella]] that allow it motility. It may be oxidase negative, but ''B. burgdorferi'' possesses a gene coding for [[superoxide dismutase]]. This protein inhibits the accumulation of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).<ref name=":5" /> The bacterium appears able to utilize many different monosaccharides for use in energy production.<ref name=":6" />

===Morphology===
''B. burgdorferi'' resembles other [[spirochete]]s in that it has an outer membrane and inner membrane with a thin layer of [[peptidoglycan]] in between. It is characterized as having a flexible cell well and has cells that are long and cylindrical with them being roughly 1 micron wide. However, the outer membrane lacks [[lipopolysaccharide]]. Its shape is a flat wave.  It is about 0.3 μm wide and 5 to 20 μm in length.<ref name=Motaleb2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Motaleb MA, Liu J, Wooten RM |title=Spirochetal motility and chemotaxis in the natural enzootic cycle and development of Lyme disease |journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology |volume=28 |pages=106–13 |year=2015 |pmid=26519910 |pmc=4688064 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2015.09.006 }}</ref>

''B. burgdorferi'' is a [[microaerophile|microaerobic]], motile spirochete with seven to 11 bundled perisplasmic [[Flagellum|flagella]] set at each end that allow the bacterium to move in low- and high-viscosity media alike, which is related to its high virulence factor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Motaleb|first1=Mohammed|last2=Corum|first2=Linda|last3=Bono|first3=James|last4=Elias|first4=Abdallah|last5=Rosa|first5=Patricia|last6=Samuels|first6=D.

===Metabolism===
''B. burgdorferi'' is a slow-growing microaerophilic spirochete with a doubling time of 24 to 48 hours.<ref name=Zuckert2007>{{cite book |doi=10.1002/9780471729259.mc12c01s4 |chapter=Laboratory Maintenance of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' |title=Current Protocols in Microbiology |year=2007 |last1=Zückert |first1=Wolfram R. |volume=4 |pages=12C.1.1–12C.1.10 |pmid=18770608 |isbn=978-0-471-72925-9 }}</ref>

=== Transformation ===
Bacterial [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] has been utilized by researchers in order to isolate specific pathogenic genes among the ''Borrelia burgdorferi''. ''B. burgdorferi'' strains appear to be highly insufficient for use in bacterial transformation due to the large amount of DNA needed for transformation, the time it takes to produce reliable transformants, and the influence of [[restriction modification system]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brisson |first1=Dustin |last2=Dykhuizen |first2=Daniel E |date=2004-10-01 |title=ospC Diversity in Borrelia burgdorferi |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.104.028738 |journal=Genetics |volume=168 |issue=2 |pages=713–722 |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.028738 |pmid=15514047 |pmc=1448846 |issn=1943-2631}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hyde |first1=Jenny A. |last2=Weening |first2=Eric H. |last3=Skare |first3=Jon T. |date=February 2011 |title=Genetic Manipulation of Borrelia burgdorferi |journal=Current Protocols in Microbiology |volume=CHAPTER |pages=Unit–12C.4 |doi=10.1002/9780471729259.mc12c04s20 |issn=1934-8525 |pmc=3561735 |pmid=21400675}}</ref> In fact, infectivity of ''B. burgdorferi'' often requires the gene ''[[pncA]]'', which is present on a bacterial plasmid that contains the gene ''bbe02'' that is highly selected against during transformation.

==Life cycle==
''B. burgdorferi'' circulates between ''[[Ixodes]]'' ticks and a [[vertebrate]] host in an [[sylvatic cycle|enzootic cycle]].<ref name=Kath2021/> ''B. burgdorferi'' living in a tick is mainly acquired through blood meals from an infected, competent vertebrate host,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eisen |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Eisen |first2=Lars |title=The Blacklegged Tick, Ixodes Scapularis: An Increasing Public Health Concern |journal=Trends in Parasitology |date=April 2018 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=295–6 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2017.12.006 |pmid=29336985 |url= |pmc=5879012 }}</ref> but rare cases of [[transovarial transmission]] exist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rollend |first1=Lindsay |last2=Fish |first2=Durland |last3=Childs |first3=James E. |title=Transovarial transmission of Borrelia spirochetes by Ixodes scapularis: A summary of the literature and recent observations |journal=Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases |date=February 2013 |volume=4 |issue=1–2 |pages=46–51 |doi=10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.06.008 |pmid=23238242 }}</ref> Once a tick is infected, it will then transmit ''B. burgdorferi'' by feeding on another vertebrate to complete the cycle.<ref name="Brisson2012" />  Ticks can transmit ''B. burgdorferi'' to humans, but humans are dead-end hosts, unlikely to continue the life cycle of the spirochete.<ref name="Radolf2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Radolf JD, Caimano MJ, Stevenson B, Hu LT |title=Of ticks, mice and men: understanding the dual-host lifestyle of Lyme disease spirochaetes |journal=Nature Reviews.

==Disease==
{{Main|Lyme disease}}
''B. burgdorferi'' is the [[causative agent]] of [[Lyme disease]] and is why this bacteria is so important and being studied. It is most commonly transmitted from [[tick]]s to humans. Humans act as the tick's [[Host (biology)|host]] for this bacteria. Lyme disease is a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]], [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne disease]] transmitted by the ''[[Ixodes]]'' [[tick]] (also the vector for ''[[Babesia]]'' and ''[[Anaplasma]]'').  The infected nymphal tick transmits ''B. burgdorferi'' via its saliva to the human during its blood meal.<ref name="Tilly2008"/>

Clinical presentation of Lyme disease is best known for the characteristic bull's-eye rash (also known as ''[[erythema chronicum migrans]]'') but can also include [[myocarditis]], [[cardiomyopathy]], [[arrythmia]], [[arthritis]], [[arthralgia]], [[meningitis]], [[neuropathies]], and [[facial nerve palsy]]<ref name="Centers For Disease Control and Prevention">{{cite web | title = Signs and Symptoms, Lyme Disease |publisher= Centers For Disease Control| url = https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/ |date=March 4, 2015| access-date = 2015-07-16  }}</ref> depending on the stage of infection.

Progression of the disease follows three stages.

=== Stage 1 ===
Stage 1 is known as the Early Localized stage and occurs approximately 3 days - 1 month after inoculation. It affects the local area around the bite and is characterized by local swelling and / or a red "bull's-eye" rash (also known as ''[[erythema chronicum migrans]]'') seen as an erythematous circle encircling a defined center that expands outward. It can get as large as 15&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name=burg2013>{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard J.|last2=Funke|first2=Berdell R.|last3=Case|first3=Christine L.|title=Microbiology: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-321-73360-3|pages=658–659}}</ref>{{rp|658}} Once the rash starts to subside the first symptoms can manifest as "flu-like" symptoms. At this stage, antibiotics are most efficacious to prevent further growth and symptoms of the disease before the major symptoms manifest.<ref name=burg2013 />{{rp|659}}

=== Stage 2 ===
Stage 2 is known as the Early Disseminated stage and occurs weeks - months after infection if left untreated. The bacteria spreads via the blood through the body to affect the organs. It often presents with general symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy as well as the organ-specific symptoms. It can affect the [[heart]] causing [[myocarditis]], as well as [[arrythmia]]s such as [[atrioventricular block]]s (which if significant enough may require the insertion of a pacemaker). It can affect the musculoskeletal system causing non-inflammatory transient [[arthritis]] and / or [[arthralgia]]s. It can affect the nervous system manifesting as facial paralysis ([[Bell's palsy]], classically bilateral), fatigue, and loss of memory.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

=== Stage 3 ===
Stage 3 is known as the Late Disseminated stage and occurs months - years after the initial infection. Effects of the 3rd stage include [[encephalitis]] or meningitis,<ref name=burg2013 /> as well as migratory arthropathies (most commonly of the knee).<ref name=burg2013 />

[[Anaplasmosis]] and [[babesiosis]] are also common tick-borne pathogens carried by the Ixodes tick that infect humans similarly to ''Borrelia burgdorferi''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Coinfections Acquired from Ixodes Ticks|journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews|date = 2006-10-01|issn = 0893-8512|pmc = 1592693|pmid = 17041141|pages = 708–727|volume = 19|issue = 4|doi = 10.1128/CMR.00011-06|first1 = Stephen J.|last1 = Swanson|first2 = David|last2 = Neitzel|first3 = Kurt D.|last3 = Reed|first4 = Edward A.|last4 = Belongia}}</ref> Consequently, it is possible for an Ixodes tick to coinfect a host with either two or all other diseases. When a host is coinfected, the combined effects of the diseases act synergistically, often proving to cause worse symptoms than a single infection alone<ref name=":1" />  Coinfected humans tend to display a more severe manifestation of Lyme disease. In addition, they tend to acquire a wider range of secondary symptoms, such as influenza-like symptoms.<ref name=":1" /> More studies and research must be done to determine the synergistic effect of co-infection and its effect on the human body.

===Variation of severity===
So far, there are three factors that may contribute to the severity of the clinical manifestation of Lyme Disease. The presence of ribosomal spacers, [[plasmid]]s, and the outer surface protein C (OspC) are indicators of the severity of the infection.<ref name=Weis2011 /> Additionally, humans, themselves, vary in their response to the infection.<ref name=Weis2011 /> The variation in response leads to different clinical manifestations and different infections to different organs.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

<!--===Additional information on Lyme disease and its cause===
Antibiotic therapy resolves clinical symptoms, in most cases, during the early stages of infection. Persistent or relapsing symptoms can later develop in a subset of patients. The underlying mechanisms, pathogenesis, and treatment of PTLDS remain unknown. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a vaccine that will prevent the incidence of serious tick-borne infections such as Lyme borreliosis. Most research efforts focus on the identification of either ''B. burgdorferi'' antigens or tick proteins that are required for the survival of spirochetes within ticks, in an attempt to interfere with pathogen transmission from ticks or infectivity in the hosts, thereby preventing Lyme disease.-->

==Molecular pathogenesis==

After the pathogen is transmitted, it will acclimate to the mammalian conditions. ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' will change its [[glycoprotein]]s and [[protease]]s on its plasma membrane to facilitate its dissemination throughout the blood.<ref name=Weis2011>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK57011/|title = Critical Needs and Gaps in Understanding Prevention, Amelioration, and Resolution of Lyme and Other Tick-Borne Diseases: The Short-Term and Long-Term Outcomes: Workshop Report.|last = Weis|first = Janet|date = 2011|journal = The National Academies|pages = 97–101}}</ref> While infecting, ''B. burgdorferi'' will express proteins that will interact with [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]], [[platelet]]s, [[chondrocyte]]s, and the [[extracellular matrix]].<ref name=Weis2011 /> This interaction inhibits proper function of the infected areas, leading to the pathological manifestations of Lyme disease. In response, the host will initiate an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] to attempt to remove the infection.<ref name=Weis2011 />

''Borrelia burgdorferi'', also, expresses at least seven plasminogen binding proteins for interference of [[factor H]] at the activation level.  This is part of a [[complement system]] evasion strategy that leads to downstream blocking of immune response.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zipfel P., Hallström T., Riesbeck K. | year = 2013 | title = Human complement control and complement evasion by pathogenic microbes – Tipping the balance | url = http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/4027108| journal = Molecular Immunology | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 152–160 | doi=10.1016/j.molimm.2013.05.222| pmid = 23810413 }}</ref>

In addition, ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' has a strategy to directly inhibit the classical pathway of complement system. A borrelial lipoprotein BBK32, expressed on the surface of ''Borrelia burgdorferi'',  binds the initiating protease complex C1 of the classical pathway. More specifically, BBK32 interacts with C1r subunit of C1. C-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein mediates the binding. As a result, C1 is trapped in an inactive form.<ref>Garcia, B.L., Zhi, H., Wager, B., Höök, M. & Skare, J.T. 2016, "Borrelia burgdorferi BBK32 Inhibits the Classical Pathway by Blocking Activation of the C1 Complement Complex", PLoS Pathogens, vol. 12, no. 1</ref>

==Genome==
''B. burgdorferi'' (B31 strain) was the third microbial [[genome]] ever [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]], following the sequencing of both ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' in 1995.

== Bacteriophage ==
Relatively few [[bacteriophage]]s are known to infect ''B. burgdorferi''. Several phage particles were isolated and some evidence suggested that they had an 8-kb [[DNA|dsDNA]] [[genome]]. Among the best-studied ''Borrelia'' phages is φBB-1, a phage with a polyhedral head and a contractile tail of 90&nbsp;nm in length.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Eggers|first1=C.

==Evolution==
Genetically diverse ''B. burgdorferi'' strains, as defined by the sequence of ''ospC'', are maintained within the Northeastern United States.  [[Balancing selection]] may act upon ''ospC'' or a nearby sequence to maintain the genetic variety of ''B. burgdorferi''.<ref name=Kurtenbach2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurtenbach K, Hanincová K, Tsao JI, Margos G, Fish D, Ogden NH |title=Fundamental processes in the evolutionary ecology of Lyme borreliosis |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=660–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16894341 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1475 |s2cid=10877654 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Balancing selection is the process by which multiple versions of a gene are kept within the gene pool at unexpectedly high frequencies. Two major models that control the selection balance of ''B.burgdorferi'' is [[Frequency-dependent selection|negative frequency-dependent selection]] and [[Polymorphism (biology)|multiple-niche polymorphism]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title = Borrelia: Molecular Biology, Host Interaction and Pathogenesis|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1iHDrzSIcI0C|publisher = Horizon Scientific Press|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9781904455585|first = D. Scott|last = Samuels}}</ref> These models may explain how ''B. burgdorferi'' have diversified, and how selection may have affected the distribution of the ''B. burgdorferi'' variants, or the variation of specific traits of the species, in certain environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Negative-frequency dependent selection===
In negative frequency-dependent selection, rare and uncommon variants will have a selective advantage over variants that are very common in an environment.<ref name=":3" /> For ''B. burgdorferi'', low-frequency variants will be advantageous because potential hosts will be less likely to mount an immunological response to the variant-specific OspC outer protein.<ref name=":3" />

===Multiple-niche polymorphism===
Ecological niches are all of the variables in an environment, such as the resources, competitors, and responses, that contribute to the organism's fitness. Multiple-niche polymorphism states that diversity is maintained within a population due to the varying amount of possible niches and environments.<ref name=":3" /> Therefore, the more various niches the more likelihood of polymophrism and diversity. For ''B. burgdorferi'', varying vertebrae niches, such as deer and mice, can affect the overall balancing selection for variants.<ref name=":3" />
