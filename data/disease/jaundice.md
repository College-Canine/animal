Eye [[conjunctiva]] has a particularly high affinity for bilirubin deposition due to high elastin content. Slight increases in serum bilirubin can, therefore, be detected early on by observing the yellowing of sclerae. Traditionally referred to as scleral icterus, this term is actually a misnomer, because bilirubin deposition technically occurs in the [[Conjunctiva|conjunctival membranes]] overlying the avascular sclera. Thus, the proper term for the yellowing of "white of the eyes" is conjunctival icterus.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = McGee SR |title=Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis |date=2018 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-39276-1 |pages=59–68 |edition=4th |chapter=Jaundice}}</ref>

A much less common sign of jaundice specifically during childhood is yellowish or greenish teeth. In developing children, hyperbilirubinemia may cause a yellow or green discoloration of teeth due to bilirubin deposition during the process of tooth calcification.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Neville BW |title=Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |isbn=978-981-4371-07-0 |edition=3rd |location=Singapore |pages=798 }}</ref> While this may occur in children with hyperbilirubinemia, tooth discoloration due to hyperbilirubinemia is not observed in individuals with adult-onset liver disease.

===Posthepatic causes (Obstructive jaundice)===
Posthepatic jaundice (obstructive jaundice) is caused by a blockage of bile ducts that transport bile containing conjugated bilirubin out of the liver for excretion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bilirubin Metabolism – an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bilirubin-metabolism |access-date=2022-04-23 |website=www.sciencedirect.com}}</ref> This is a list of conditions that can cause posthepatic jaundice:

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Heme Breakdown.png|thumb]]Jaundice is typically caused by an underlying pathological process that occurs at some point along the normal physiological pathway of heme metabolism. A deeper understanding of the anatomical flow of normal heme metabolism is essential to appreciate the importance of prehepatic, hepatic, and posthepatic categories. Thus, an anatomical approach to heme metabolism precedes a discussion of the pathophysiology of jaundice.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== Normal heme metabolism ===

==== Prehepatic metabolism ====
When [[Red blood cell|red blood cells]] complete their lifespan of about 120 days, or if they are damaged, they rupture as they pass through the [[reticuloendothelial system]], and cell contents including [[hemoglobin]] are released into circulation. Macrophages phagocytose free hemoglobin and split it into [[heme]] and [[globin]]. Two reactions then take place with the heme molecule. The first [[oxidation]] reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme [[heme oxygenase]] and results in [[biliverdin]] (green color pigment), [[iron]], and [[carbon monoxide]]. The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow color [[tetrapyrrole]] pigment called bilirubin by cytosolic enzyme [[biliverdin reductase]]. This bilirubin is "unconjugated", "free", or "indirect" bilirubin. Around 4&nbsp;mg of bilirubin per kg of blood are produced each day.<ref name="PedRev">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pashankar D, Schreiber RA|s2cid=11100275|date=July 2001|title=Jaundice in older children and adolescents|journal=Pediatrics in Review|volume=22|issue=7|pages=219–26|doi=10.1542/pir.22-7-219|pmid=11435623}}</ref> The majority of this bilirubin comes from the breakdown of heme from expired red blood cells in the process just described. Roughly 20% comes from other heme sources, however, including ineffective [[erythropoiesis]], and the breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as muscle [[myoglobin]] and [[cytochrome]]s.<ref name="PedRev" /> The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the liver through the bloodstream. Because this bilirubin is not soluble, it is transported through the blood bound to [[serum albumin]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==== Hepatic metabolism ====
Once unconjugated bilirubin arrives in the liver, liver enzyme [[UDP-glucuronyl-transferase|UDP-glucuronyl transferase]] conjugates bilirubin + [[glucuronic acid]] → [[bilirubin diglucuronide]] (conjugated bilirubin). Bilirubin that has been conjugated by the liver is water-soluble and excreted into the gallbladder.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==== Posthepatic metabolism ====
Bilirubin enters the intestinal tract via bile. In the intestinal tract, bilirubin is converted into [[urobilinogen]] by symbiotic intestinal bacteria. Most urobilinogen is converted into [[stercobilinogen]] and further oxidized into [[stercobilin]]. Stercobilin is excreted via [[feces]], giving stool its characteristic brown coloration.<ref name="Berthelot_2018">{{cite book | vauthors = Berthelot P, Duvaldestin P, Fevery J | chapter = Physiology and Disorders of Human Bilirubin Metabolism|date=2018-01-18| title = Bilirubin|pages=173–214|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-351-07011-9 |doi=10.1201/9781351070119-6}}</ref> A small portion of urobilinogen is reabsorbed back into the gastrointestinal cells. Most reabsorbed urobilinogen undergoes hepatobiliary recirculation. A smaller portion of reabsorbed urobilinogen is filtered into the kidneys. In the urine, urobilinogen is converted to [[urobilin]], which gives urine its characteristic yellow color.<ref name="Berthelot_2018" />

=== Abnormalities in heme metabolism and excretion ===
One way to understand jaundice pathophysiology is to organize it into disorders that cause increased bilirubin production (abnormal heme metabolism) or decreased bilirubin excretion (abnormal heme excretion).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==== Prehepatic pathophysiology ====
Prehepatic jaundice results from a pathological increase in bilirubin production: an increased rate of erythrocyte hemolysis causes increased bilirubin production, leading to increased deposition of bilirubin in mucosal tissues and the appearance of a yellow hue.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==== Hepatic pathophysiology ====
Hepatic jaundice (hepatocellular jaundice) is due to significant disruption of liver function, leading to hepatic cell death and necrosis and impaired bilirubin transport across [[hepatocyte]]s. Bilirubin transport across hepatocytes may be impaired at any point between hepatocellular uptake of unconjugated bilirubin and hepatocellular transport of conjugated bilirubin into the gallbladder. In addition, subsequent cellular [[oedema|edema]] due to inflammation causes mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic biliary tract. Most commonly, interferences in all three major steps of bilirubin metabolism — uptake, conjugation, and excretion — usually occur in hepatocellular jaundice. Thus, an abnormal rise in both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin (formerly called '''cholemia''') will be present. Because excretion (the rate-limiting step) is usually impaired to the greatest extent, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia predominates.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medicine: Prep Manual for Undergraduates|vauthors=Mathew KG|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=978-81-312-1154-0|edition=3rd|pages=296–297}}</ref>

The unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emptying of the bile into the [[lymph]] exiting the liver. Thus, most of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type, and this conjugated bilirubin, which did not go to the intestine to become [[urobilinogen]], gives the urine a dark color.<ref>{{cite book|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology|vauthors=Hall JE, Guyton AC|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|page=841}}</ref>{{what|date=May 2022}}
<!-- Bilirubinuria is due to excess conjugated bilirubin excreted in the urine.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
 -->

==== Posthepatic pathophysiology ====
Posthepatic jaundice, also called obstructive jaundice, is due to the blockage of bile excretion from the biliary tract, which leads to increased conjugated bilirubin and bile salts there. In complete obstruction of the bile duct, conjugated bilirubin cannot access the intestinal tract, disrupting further bilirubin conversion to urobilinogen and, therefore, no [[stercobilin]] or [[urobilin]] is produced. In obstructive jaundice, excess conjugated bilirubin is filtered into the urine without urobilinogen. Conjugated bilirubin in urine (bilirubinuria) gives urine an abnormally dark brown color. Thus, the presence of pale stool (stercobilin absent from feces) and dark urine (conjugated bilirubin present in urine) suggests an obstructive cause of jaundice. Because these associated signs are also positive in many hepatic jaundice conditions, they cannot be a reliable clinical feature to distinguish obstructive versus hepatocellular jaundice causes.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Beckingham IJ, Ryder SD|date=January 2001|title=ABC of diseases of liver, pancreas, and biliary system.

Most people presenting with jaundice have various predictable patterns of liver panel abnormalities, though significant variation does exist. The typical liver panel includes blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the [[aminotransferases]] (ALT, AST), and [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP); bilirubin (which causes the jaundice); and protein levels, specifically, [[Blood proteins|total protein]] and [[albumin]]. Other primary lab tests for liver function include [[gamma glutamyl transpeptidase]] (GGT) and [[prothrombin time]] (PT).<ref>{{cite web |title=Liver Function Tests |url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/liver-function-tests/ |website=MedlinePlus |publisher=US National Library of Medicine |access-date=16 January 2021}}</ref> No single test can differentiate between various classifications of jaundice.

Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which are only elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. ALP and GGT levels typically rise with one pattern while [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST) and [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/L) and GGT (18–85 IU/L) levels rise proportionately as high as the AST (12–38 IU/L) and ALT (10–45 IU/L) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. If the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, though, this indicates a liver problem. Finally, distinguishing between liver causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels typically are higher than ALT. This remains the case in most liver disorders except for hepatitis (viral or hepatotoxic). Alcoholic liver damage may have fairly normal ALT levels, with AST 10 times higher than ALT. If ALT is higher than AST, however, this is indicative of hepatitis. Levels of ALT and AST are not well correlated to the extent of liver damage, although rapid drops in these levels from very high levels can indicate severe necrosis. Low levels of albumin tend to indicate a chronic condition, while the level is normal in hepatitis and cholestasis.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Laboratory results for liver panels are frequently compared by the magnitude of their differences, not the pure number, as well as by their ratios. The AST:ALT ratio can be a good indicator of whether the disorder is alcoholic liver damage (above 10), some other form of liver damage (above 1), or hepatitis (less than 1). Bilirubin levels greater than 10 times normal could indicate neoplastic or intrahepatic cholestasis. Levels lower than this tend to indicate hepatocellular causes. AST levels greater than 15 times normal tend to indicate acute hepatocellular damage. Less than this tend to indicate obstructive causes. ALP levels greater than 5 times normal tend to indicate obstruction, while levels greater than 10 times normal can indicate drug (toxin) induced cholestatic hepatitis or [[cytomegalovirus]] infection. Both of these conditions can also have ALT and AST greater than 20 times normal. GGT levels greater than 10 times normal typically indicate cholestasis. Levels 5–10 times tend to indicate viral hepatitis. Levels less than 5 times normal tend to indicate drug toxicity. Acute hepatitis typically has ALT and AST levels rising 20–30 times normal (above 1000) and may remain significantly elevated for several weeks. [[Acetaminophen]] toxicity can result in ALT and AST levels greater than 50 times than normal.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Laboratory findings depend on the cause of jaundice:
* Urine: conjugated bilirubin present, urobilinogen > 2 units but variable (except in children)
* [[Plasma protein]]s show characteristic changes.
* Plasma albumin level is low, but plasma [[globulin]]s are raised due to an increased formation of [[Antibody|antibodies]].

Unconjugated bilirubin is hydrophobic, so cannot be excreted in urine. Thus, the finding of increased urobilinogen in the urine without the presence of bilirubin in the urine (due to its unconjugated state) suggests hemolytic jaundice as the underlying disease process.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Cadogen M |date=2019-04-21|title=Bilirubin and Jaundice|url=https://litfl.com/bilirubin-and-jaundice/|access-date=2019-11-19|website=Life in the Fast Lane|language=en-US}}</ref> Urobilinogen will be greater than 2 units, as hemolytic anemia causes increased heme metabolism; one exception being the case of infants, where the [[gut flora]] has not developed). Conversely, conjugated bilirubin is hydrophilic and thus can be detected as present in the urine — [[bilirubinuria]] — in contrast to unconjugated bilirubin, which is absent in the urine.<ref name="AFP2004">{{cite journal|vauthors=Roche SP, Kobos R|date=January 2004|title=Jaundice in the adult patient|journal=American Family Physician|volume=69|issue=2|pages=299–304|pmid=14765767}}</ref>

=== Imaging ===
[[Medical imaging]] such as [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan]], and [[Cholescintigraphy|HIDA scan]] are useful for detecting bile-duct blockage.<ref name="AFP2004" />

===Differential diagnosis===
* Yellow discoloration of the skin, especially on the palms and the soles, but not of the sclera or inside the mouth, is often due to [[carotenemia]]—a harmless condition.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1104368|Carotenemia}}</ref>
* Yellow discoloration of the skin can also rarely occur with [[copper toxicity|hypercupremia]], whether from [[Wilson's disease]] or from another metabolic derangement. Similarly, a golden-ish ring at the edges of the [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] can occur ([[:File:Kayser-Fleischer ring.jpg|Kayser-Fleischer ring]]).<!--Sanders 2009 is an example of a [[WP:RS]] ref for this sign in DDx.-->

== Complications ==
Hyperbilirubinemia, more precisely hyperbilirubinemia due to the unconjugated fraction, may cause bilirubin to accumulate in the [[grey matter]] of the [[central nervous system]], potentially causing irreversible neurological damage, leading to a condition known as [[kernicterus]]. Depending on the level of exposure, the effects range from unnoticeable to severe brain damage and even death. Newborns are especially vulnerable to hyperbilirubinemia-induced neurological damage, so must be carefully monitored for alterations in their serum bilirubin levels.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== Neonatal jaundice ===
{{main|Neonatal jaundice}}
==== Symptoms ====
Jaundice in infants presents with yellowed skin and icteral sclerae. Neonatal jaundice spreads in a cephalocaudal pattern, affecting the face and neck before spreading down to the trunk and lower extremities in more severe cases.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Telega GW |chapter=Jaundice|date=2018|title=Nelson Pediatric Symptom-Based Diagnosis|pages=255–274.e1|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-39956-2.00015-7|isbn=978-0-323-39956-2}}</ref> Other symptoms may include drowsiness, poor feeding, and in severe cases, unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause permanent neurological damage ([[kernicterus]]).

==== Causes ====
The most common cause of jaundice in infants is [[Physiologic jaundice|normal physiologic jaundice]]. Pathologic causes of neonatal jaundice include:
* Formula jaundice<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bertini G, Dani C, Tronchin M, Rubaltelli FF|date=March 2001|title=Is breastfeeding really favoring early neonatal jaundice?|journal=Pediatrics|volume=107|issue=3|pages=E41|doi=10.1542/peds.107.3.e41|pmid=11230622|doi-access=free}}</ref>
* [[Hereditary spherocytosis]]
* [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]]

* [[Alagille syndrome]] (genetic defect resulting in hypoplastic intrahepatic bile ducts)
* [[Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]]
* [[Pyknocytosis]] (due to vitamin deficiency)
* [[Cretinism]] (congenital hypothyroidism)
* Sepsis or other infectious causes

Jaundice in newborns is usually transient and dissipates without medical intervention.
