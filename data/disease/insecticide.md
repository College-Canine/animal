'''Insecticides''' are [[pesticide]]s used to kill [[insect]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2006/pdf/7811x2075.pdf |page=2123 |title=Glossary of Terms Relating to Pesticides |author=IUPAC |publisher=[[IUPAC]] |year=2006 |access-date=January 28, 2014}}</ref> They include ovicides and [[larvicides]] used against insect [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[larva]]e, respectively. [[Acaricide|Acaricides]], which kill [[Mite|mites]] and [[Tick|ticks]], are not strictly insecticides, but are usually classified together with insecticides. The major use of Insecticides is [[agriculture]], but they are also used in home and garden, industrial buildings, [[vector control]] and control of insect [[Parasitism|parasites]] of animals and humans. Insecticides are claimed to be a major factor behind the increase in the 20th-century's agricultural productivity.<ref name="EmdenPeakall1996">{{cite book|first1=H.F. |last1=van Emden|first2=David B. |last2=Peakall|title=Beyond Silent Spring|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PyjFtiNFVG0C}}|date=30 June 1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-412-72800-6}}</ref> Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans and/or animals; some become concentrated as they spread along the food chain.

The [[mode of action]] describes how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest. It provides another way of classifying insecticides. Mode of action can be important in understanding whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals.

Insecticides are distinct from [[Insect repellent|repellents]], which repel but do not kill.

== Sales ==
In 2016 insecticides were estimated to account for 18% of worldwide pesticide sales.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Delso |first=N.

== Systemic insecticides ==
{{Toclimit|3}}

Insecticides may be systemic or non-systemic (contact insecticides).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Y |last2=Lorsbach |first2=BA |last3=Castetter |first3=S |last4=Lambert |first4=WT |last5=Kister |first5=J |last6=Wang |first6=N |title=Physicochemical property guidelines for modern agrochemicals |journal=Pest Management Science |date=2018 |volume=74 |issue=9 |page=1979-1991 |doi=10.1002/ps.5037 |pmid=29667318 |s2cid=4937939}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hofstetter |first1=S |title=How To Design for a Tailored Subcellular Distribution of Systemic Agrochemicals in Plant Tissues |journal=J.

Systemic insecticides penetrate into the plant and move (translocate) inside the plant. Translocation may be upward in the [[xylem]], or downward in the [[phloem]] or both. An insecticide with a high enough concentration in phloem, is particularly effective at killing insects, such as aphids, which feed on phloem. Such insects are often termed sap-feeding insects or sucking insects. Systemicity is a prerequisite for the pesticide to be used as a [[Seed treatment|seed-treatment]].

Contact insecticides (non-systemic insecticides) remain on the leaf surface and act through direct contact with the insect.

Efficacy can be related to the quality of [[pesticide application]], with small droplets, such as [[aerosol]]s often improving performance.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dropdata.org |title=dropdata.org |publisher=dropdata.org |access-date=2011-01-05}}{{better source needed|date=March 2015}}</ref>

{{Further|List of insecticides}}
=== Development ===
{{main|Insecticide development}}

=== Organochlorides ===

The best known [[organochloride]], [[DDT]], was created by Swiss scientist [[Paul Hermann Müller|Paul Müller]]. For this discovery, he was awarded the 1948 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web |editor=Karl Grandin | title=Paul Müller Biography | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/muller-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | year=1948 | access-date=2008-07-24}}</ref>  DDT was introduced in 1944. It functions by opening [[sodium channel]]s in the insect's [[nerve cell]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Vijverberg |title=Similar mode of action of pyrethroids and DDT on sodium channel gating in myelinated nerves |journal=Nature |volume=295 |issue=5850 |pages=601–603 |year=1982 |display-authors=1 |bibcode=1982Natur.295..601V |last2=Van Den Bercken |first2=Joep |doi=10.1038/295601a0|pmid=6276777 |s2cid=4259608 }}</ref> The contemporaneous rise of the chemical industry facilitated large-scale production of [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]]s including various [[cyclodiene]] and [[hexachlorocyclohexane]] compounds. Although commonly used in the past, many older chemicals have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects (''e.g.'' [[DDT]], [[chlordane]], and [[toxaphene]]).<ref>{{Cite web |date=Sep 2002 |title=Public Health Statement for DDT, DDE, and DDD |url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp35-c1-b.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923121618/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp35-c1-b.pdf |archive-date=2008-09-23 |access-date=Dec 9, 2018 |website=atsdr.cdc.gov |publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|ATSDR]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=Apr 18, 2012 |title=Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Chlordane |url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=349&tid=62 |access-date=Dec 9, 2018 |website=atsdr.cdc.gov |publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|ATSDR]]}}</ref>

=== Organophosphates ===

[[Organophosphate]]s are another large class of contact insecticides.  These also target the insect's nervous system. Organophosphates interfere with the [[enzyme]]s [[acetylcholinesterase]] and other [[cholinesterase]]s, causing an increase in synaptic [[acetylcholine]] and overstimulation of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Colović MB, Krstić DZ, Lazarević-Pašti TD, Bondžić AM, Vasić VM |date=May 2013 |title=Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: pharmacology and toxicology |journal=Current Neuropharmacology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=315–35 |doi=10.2174/1570159X11311030006 |pmc=3648782 |pmid=24179466}}</ref> and killing or disabling the insect. Organophosphate insecticides and [[chemical warfare]] [[Nerve agent|nerve agents]] (such as [[sarin]], [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[soman]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]]) have the same mechanism of action. Organophosphates have a cumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.<ref name="palmerw"/> In the US, organophosphate use declined with the rise of substitutes.<ref name=s730>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.730 | title = Infographic: Pesticide Planet | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6147 | pages = 730–731 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23950524| bibcode = 2013Sci...341..730. }}</ref> Many of these insecticides, first developed in the mid 20th century, are very poisonous.<ref>{{Cite web |date=Aug 1996 |title=Toxicological Profile for Toxaphene |url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/toxaphene_508.pdf |access-date=Dec 9, 2018 |website=ntp.niehs.nih.gov |publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|ATSDR]] |pages=5}}</ref> Many [[Organophosphate|organophosphates]] do not persist in the environment.

=== Carbamates ===
[[Carbamate]] insecticides have similar mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are somewhat less toxic.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Pyrethroids ===

[[Pyrethroid]] insecticides mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound [[pyrethrin]], the [[biopesticide]] found in ''[[Pyrethrum]]'' (Now ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' and ''[[Tanacetum]]'') species. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. These compounds are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators and are less toxic than organophosphates and carbamates. Compounds in this group are often [[Pesticide application|applied against household pests]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Class |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Kintrup |first2=J. | title=Pyrethroids as household insecticides: analysis, indoor exposure and persistence | journal=Fresenius' Journal of Analytical Chemistry |volume=340 | issue=7|pages=446–453 | year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00322420 |s2cid=95713100 }}</ref> Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soderlund |first=David |title=Hayes' Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology |publisher=Academic Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-12-374367-1 |editor-last=Kreiger |editor-first=Robert |edition=3rd |pages=1665–1686 |chapter=Chapter 77 – Toxicology and Mode of Action of Pyrethroid Insecticides |oclc=918401061 |name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

=== Neonicotinoids ===
[[Neonicotinoids]] are a class of neuro-active [[Insecticide|insecticides]] chemically similar to [[nicotine]].(with much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence). These chemicals are [[acetylcholine]] receptor [[agonist]]s. They are broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, with rapid action (minutes-hours). They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and [[soil]] treatments. Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, [[stylet (anatomy)|stylet]] withdrawal ([[aphid]]s), disoriented movement, paralysis and death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pi117|title=Pesticide Toxicity Profile: Neonicotinoid Pesticides|first=Frederick M.|last=Fishel|date=9 March 2016|access-date=11 March 2012|archive-date=28 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428035003/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/PI117|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[Imidacloprid]], of the neonicotinoid family, is the most widely used insecticide in the world.<ref name="Yamamoto1999">{{cite book |last=Yamamoto |first=Izuru |title=Nicotinoid Insecticides and the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1999 |isbn=978-4-431-70213-9 |editor-last=Yamamoto |editor-first=Izuru |location=Tokyo |pages=3–27 |contribution=Nicotine to Nicotinoids: 1962 to 1997 |oclc=468555571 |editor2-last=Casida |editor2-first=John |editor2-link=John E.

=== Phenylpyrazoles ===

[[Phenylpyrazole insecticides]], such as [[fipronil]] are a class of synthetic insecticides that operate by interfering with GABA receptors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://u.osu.edu/pesticide/2019/05/26/fipronil-a-phenylpyrazole-pesticides/|title=Fipronil- A Phenylpyrazole Pesticides}}</ref>

=== Butenolides ===
Butenolide [[pesticide]]s are a novel group of chemicals, similar to neonicotinoids in their mode of action, that have so far only one representative: [[flupyradifurone]]. They are [[acetylcholine]] receptor [[agonist]]s, like [[neonicotinoid]]s, but with a different pharmacophore.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Nauen |first1=Ralf |last2=Jeschke |first2=Peter |last3=Velten |first3=Robert |last4=Beck |first4=Michael E |last5=Ebbinghaus-Kintscher |first5=Ulrich |last6=Thielert |first6=Wolfgang |last7=Wölfel |first7=Katharina |last8=Haas |first8=Matthias |last9=Kunz |first9=Klaus |last10=Raupach |first10=Georg |date=June 2015 |title=Flupyradifurone: a brief profile of a new butenolide insecticide |journal=Pest Management Science |language=en |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=850–862 |doi=10.1002/ps.3932 |pmc=4657471 |pmid=25351824}}</ref> They are broad-spectrum systemic insecticides, applied as sprays, drenches, seed and [[soil]] treatments.

{{anchor|Ryanoids|Diamides}}

=== Ryanoids/diamides ===
[[Diamide insecticide|Diamides]] are synthetic [[ryanoid]] analogues with the same mode of action as [[ryanodine]], a naturally occurring insecticide extracted from ''Ryania speciosa'' ([[Salicaceae]]). They bind to [[calcium channel]]s in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nerve transmission. The first insecticide from this class to be registered was Rynaxypyr, generic name [[chlorantraniliprole]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/factsheets/chloran.pdf|title=Pesticide Fact Sheet- chlorantraniliprole |publisher=epa.gov|access-date=2011-09-14}}</ref>

== Insect growth regulators ==
[[Insect growth regulator]] (IGR) is a term coined to include insect [[hormone]] mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit [[chitin]] (exoskeleton) [[biosynthesis]] in insects<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> [[Diflubenzuron]] is a member of the latter class, used primarily to control [[caterpillar]]s that are pests. The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids ([[juvenile hormone]] analogues). Of these, [[methoprene]] is most widely used. It has no observable acute toxicity in rats and is approved by [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) for use in drinking water [[cistern]]s to combat [[malaria]]. Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including [[mosquito]]es, several [[fly]] species, and [[flea]]s. Two very similar products, [[hydroprene]] and kinoprene, are used for controlling species such as [[cockroach]]es and [[white fly|white flies]]. Methoprene was registered with the EPA in 1975. Virtually no reports of resistance have been filed. A more recent type of IGR is the [[ecdysone]] agonist [[tebufenozide]] (MIMIC), which is used in [[forestry]] and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.

==Biological pesticides==
{{main| Biopesticide}}
More natural insecticides have been interesting targets of research for two main reasons, firstly because the most common chemicals are [[insecticide resistance|losing effectiveness]], and secondly due to their toxic effects upon the environment.<ref name="Mansour-et-al-2017">{{cite journal | first1=Ramzi | last1=Mansour | first2=Kaouthar | last2=Grissa-Lebdi | first3=Pompeo | last3=Suma | first4=Gaetana | last4=Mazzeo | first5=Agatino | last5=Russo | title=Key scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea) of high economic importance in a Mediterranean area: host plants, bio-ecological characteristics, natural enemies and pest management strategies – a review | journal=[[Plant Protection Science]] | publisher={{Interlanguage link|Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences|cs|Česká akademie zemědělských věd}} | volume=53 | issue=1 | date=2017-01-05 | issn=1212-2580 | doi=10.17221/53/2016-pps | pages=1–14| doi-access=free }}</ref> Many organic compounds are already produced by plants for the purpose of defending the host plant from predation, and can be turned toward human ends.

A trivial case is tree [[rosin]], which is a natural insecticide.  Specifically, the production of [[oleoresin]] by [[Pinophyta|conifer species]] is a component of the defense response against insect attack and fungal [[pathogen]] infection.<ref name="Defensive Biosynthesis of Resin in Conifers">{{cite journal|author1=Trapp, S. |author2=Croteau, R. |title=Defensive Biosynthesis of Resin in Conifers|journal=  Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|year= 2001|volume= 52|pages= 689–724 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.arplant.52.1.689|pmid=11337413|issue=1}}</ref>  Many fragrances, e.g. [[oil of wintergreen]], are in fact antifeedants.

===Other biological approaches===
==== Plant-incorporated protectants ====
===== ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' =====
Transgenic crops that act as insecticides began in 1996 with a [[genetically modified potato]] that produced [[Cry protein]]s, derived from the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', which is toxic to beetle [[larvae]] such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]].<ref name=s732 />

===== RNA interference =====
The technique has been expanded to include the use of RNAi insecticides which fatally [[gene silencing|silence]] crucial insect genes. (RNAi likely originally evolved as a defense against [[virus]]es.)<ref name=s732 /> This was first demonstrated by Baum et al. 2007, who incorporated a [[V-APTase]] as a protectant into [[transgenic maize|transgenic ''Zea mays'']] and demonstrated effectiveness against ''[[Diabrotica virgifera virgifera]]''. This suggests oral delivery against [[Coleoptera]] as a whole will probably be effective. Similar studies have followed Baum's technique to protect with [[dsRNA]]s targeting detox, especially insect [[Cytochrome P450|P450]]s. Bolognesi et al. 2012 is one of these following studies, however they found dsRNA to be processed into [[siRNA]]s by the plants (in this case ''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') themselves, and siRNAs to be less effectively taken up by insect cells. Bolognesi therefore produced additional transgenic ''S. tuberosum'' plants which instead produced ''longer'' dsRNAs ''in the [[chloroplast]]s'', which naturally accumulate dsRNAs but do not have the machinery to convert them to siRNAs.<ref name="Zhu-Palli-2020">{{cite journal | last1=Zhu | first1=Kun Yan | last2=Palli | first2=Subba Reddy | title=Mechanisms, Applications, and Challenges of Insect RNA Interference | journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] | publisher=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | volume=65 | issue=1 | date=2020-01-07 | issn=0066-4170 | doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-011019-025224 | pages=293–311| pmid=31610134 | s2cid=204702574 | pmc=9939233 }}</ref> Midgut cells in many larvae take up the molecules and help spread the signal.

==== Enzymes ====
Many plants exude substances to repel insects. Premier examples are substances activated by the [[enzyme]] [[myrosinase]]. This enzyme converts [[glucosinolate]]s to various compounds that are toxic to [[herbivorous]] insects.  One product of this enzyme is [[allyl isothiocyanate]], the pungent ingredient in [[horseradish sauce]]s.

[[File:Myrosinase general mechanism.png|thumb|center|760px|alt=mechanism of glucosinolate hydrolysis by myrosinase|Biosynthesis of antifeedants by the action of myrosinase.]]

The myrosinase is released only upon crushing the flesh of horseradish.  Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant as well as the insect, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme.<ref name="Cole">{{cite journal | author = Cole Rosemary A | year = 1976 | title = Isothiocyanates, nitriles and thiocyanates as products of autolysis of glucosinolates in ''Cruciferae'' | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 759–762 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(00)94437-6 | bibcode = 1976PChem..15..759C }}</ref>

==== Bacterial  ====
''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' is a bacterial disease that affects [[Lepidoptera]]ns and some other insects. Toxins produced by strains of this bacterium are used as a [[larvicide]] against  [[caterpillar]]s, beetles, and mosquitoes. Toxins from ''[[Saccharopolyspora spinosa]]'' are isolated from fermentations and sold as [[Spinosad]]. Because these toxins have little effect on other [[organism]]s, they are considered more [[environmentally friendly]] than synthetic pesticides. The toxin from ''B. thuringiensis'' ([[Bt toxin]]) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of [[genetic engineering]].

==== Other ====
Other biological insecticides include products based on [[entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic fungi]] (e.g., ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', ''[[Metarhizium anisopliae]]''), [[nematode]]s (e.g., ''[[Steinernema feltiae]]'') and [[virus]]es (e.g., ''[[Cydia pomonella granulovirus]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Synthetic insecticide and natural insecticides ===
A major emphasis of organic chemistry is the development of chemical tools to enhance agricultural productivity.  Insecticides represent a major area of emphasis.  Many of the major insecticides are inspired by biological analogues. Many others are not found in nature.

== Environmental harm==

=== Effects on nontarget species ===

Some insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill. For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake an insecticide granule on the ground for food and eat it.<ref name="palmerw">Palmer, WE, Bromley, PT, and Brandenburg, RL. [http://ipm.ncsu.edu/wildlife/peanuts_wildlife.html Wildlife & pesticides - Peanuts]. North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. Retrieved on 14 October 2007.</ref> Sprayed insecticide may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.<ref name="palmerw"/>

=== DDT ===
{{Main|DDT}}

The development of DDT was motivated by desire to replace more dangerous or less effective alternatives.  DDT was introduced to replace [[lead]] and [[arsenic]]-based compounds, which were in widespread use in the early 1940s.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book|first=Robert L. |last=Metcalf |publisher=Wiley-VCH  |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a14_263 |chapter=Insect Control |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |isbn=978-3527306732 }}</ref>

DDT was brought to public attention by [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. One side-effect of DDT is to reduce the thickness of shells on the eggs of predatory birds. The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, reducing bird populations. This occurs with DDT and related compounds due to the process of [[bioaccumulation]], wherein the chemical, due to its stability and fat solubility, accumulates in organisms' [[fatty tissue]]s. Also, DDT may [[biomagnification|biomagnify]], which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the [[food chain]]. The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the [[peregrine falcon]], to recover in recent years. A number of [[organochlorine]] pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide. Globally they are controlled via the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. These include: [[aldrin]], [[chlordane]], DDT, [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[heptachlor]], [[mirex]] and [[toxaphene]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Runoff and Percolation ===
Solid bait and liquid insecticides, especially if improperly applied in a location, get moved by water flow. Often, this happens through nonpoint sources where runoff carries insecticides in to larger bodies of water. As snow melts and rainfall moves over and through the ground, the water picks applied insecticides and deposits them in to larger bodies of water, rivers, wetlands, underground sources of previously potable water, and percolates in to watersheds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/ag_runoff_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff|last=Environmental Protection Agency|date=2005|website=EPA.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> This runoff and percolation of insecticides can effect the quality of water sources, harming the natural ecology and thus, indirectly effect human populations through  biomagnification and bioaccumulation.

=== Pollinator decline ===

[[Pesticide toxicity to bees|Insecticides can kill bees]] and may be a cause of [[pollinator decline]], the loss of bees that [[pollination|pollinate]] plants, and [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD),<ref name="Wells">{{cite news | author = Wells M | title = Vanishing bees threaten US crops | work = www.bbc.co.uk | publisher = BBC News | date = March 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm | access-date = 19 September 2007 }}</ref> in which worker bees from a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]] or [[Western honey bee]] colony abruptly disappear. Loss of pollinators means a reduction in [[crop yield]]s.<ref name="Wells"/> Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e. imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect bee foraging behavior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Colin |first1=M.

=== Bird decline ===
Besides the effects of direct consumption of insecticides, populations of insectivorous birds decline due to the collapse of their prey populations. Spraying of especially wheat and corn in Europe is believed to have caused an 80 per cent decline in flying insects, which in turn has reduced local bird populations by one to two thirds.<ref name="fontaine">{{cite web|title=Catastrophic collapse in farmland bird populations across France|url=https://www.birdguides.com/news/catastrophic-collapse-in-farmland-bird-populations-across-france/|date=21 March 2018|publisher=BirdGuides|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref>

== Alternatives ==
Instead of using chemical insecticides to avoid crop damage caused by insects, there are many alternative options available now that can protect farmers from major economic losses.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aidley |first=David |date=Summer 1976 |title=Alternatives to insecticides |journal=Science Progress |volume=63 |issue=250 |pages=293–303 |jstor=43420363 |pmid=1064167 }}</ref> Some of them are:
