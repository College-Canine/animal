==Classification==
''Cryptococcus neoformans'' has undergone numerous nomenclature revisions since its first description in 1895.  It formerly contained two [[varieties (biology)|varieties]]: ''C. neoformans ''var.'' neoformans'' and ''C. neoformans '' var.'' grubii''. A third variety, ''C. neoformans ''var.'' gattii'', was later defined as a distinct species, ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]''. The most recent classification system divides these varieties into seven species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hagen|first1=Ferry|last2=Khayhan|first2=Kantarawee|last3=Theelen|first3=Bart|last4=Kolecka|first4=Anna|last5=Polacheck|first5=Itzhack|last6=Sionov|first6=Edward|last7=Falk|first7=Rama|last8=Parnmen|first8= Sittiporn|last9=Lumbsch|first9=H.

The teleomorph was first described in 1975 by K.J. Kwon-Chung, who obtained cultures of ''Filobasidiella neoformans'' by crossing strains of the yeast ''C. neoformans''. She was able to observe [[basidia]] similar to those of the genus ''[[Filobasidium]]'', hence the name ''Filobasidiella'' for the new genus.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3758842 |author=Kwon-Chung KJ. |year=1975 |title=A new genus, ''Filobasidiella'', the perfect state of ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' |jstor=3758842 |journal=Mycologia |volume=67 |issue= 6|pages=1197–1200 |pmid=765816}}</ref> Following changes to the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], the practice of giving different names to teleomorph and [[anamorph]] forms of the same fungus was discontinued, meaning that ''Filobasidiella neoformans'' became a synonym of the earlier name ''Cryptococcus neoformans''.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

{{technical|section|date=February 2020}}
''Cryptococcus neoformans'' typically grows as a [[yeast]] (unicellular) and replicates by [[budding]]. It makes [[hypha]]e during mating, and eventually creates [[basidiospores]] at the end of the hyphae before producing spores. Under host-relevant conditions, including low glucose, serum, 5% carbon dioxide, and low iron, among others, the cells produce a characteristic polysaccharide capsule.<ref name="Cryptococcus: From Human Pathogen to Model Yeast, Editors: Joseph Heitman, Thomas R.

'''Meiosis (sexual reproduction), another possible survival factor for intracellular ''C. neoformans'''''

The vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates of ''C. neoformans'' are mating type alpha.  Filaments of mating type alpha have haploid nuclei ordinarily, but these can undergo a process of diploidization (perhaps by endoduplication or stimulated nuclear fusion) to form diploid cells termed [[blastospore]]s.  The diploid nuclei of blastospores are able to undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can then be dispersed.<ref name=Lin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin X, Hull CM, Heitman J | year = 2005 | title = Sexual reproduction between partners of the same mating type in ''Cryptococcus neoformans'' | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036| pages = 1017–1021 | pmid = 15846346 | doi=10.1038/nature03448| bibcode = 2005Natur.434.1017L | s2cid = 52857557 }}</ref> This process is referred to as monokaryotic fruiting.

==Serious complications of human infection==
Infection starts in lungs, disseminates via blood to meninges and then to other parts of the body. Capsule inhibits phagocytosis. Can cause a systemic infection, including fatal meningitis known as ''meningoencephalitis'' in normal, diabetic and immunocompromised hosts. The infection from ''C. neoformans'' in the brain can be fatal if untreated. CNS (central nervous system) infection may also be present as a brain abscess known as ''cryptococcomas'', subdural effusion, dementia, isolated cranial nerve lesion, spinal cord lesion, and ischemic stroke. If cryptococcal meningitis occurs, mortality rate is between 10 and 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/laboratory-biosafety-biosecurity/pathogen-safety-data-sheets-risk-assessment/cryptococcus-neoformans.html|title=Pathogen Safety Data Sheets: Infectious Substances – Cryptococcus neoformans|first=Public Health Agency of|last=Canada|date=August 19, 2011|website=www.canada.ca}}</ref> Cryptococcal meningitis causes more than 180000 deaths annually<ref>{{Chen, L. et al.

Cryptococcosis that does not affect the central nervous system can be treated with [[fluconazole]] alone.

Cryptococcal meningitis should be treated for two weeks with intravenous [[amphotericin B]] 0.7–1.0&nbsp;mg/kg/day and oral [[flucytosine]] 100&nbsp;mg/kg/day (or [[intravenous]] flucytosine 75&nbsp;mg/kg/day if the patient is unable to swallow).

The study found that the brain glucose induced AmB tolerance of ''C. neoformans'' via glucose repression activator Mig1. Mig1 inhibits the production of ergosterol, the target of AmB, and promotes the production of inositol phosphoryl ceramide (IPC), which competes with AmB for ergosterol to limit AmB efficacy in mouse brain and human CSF. Strikingly, Results of this study indicated that IPC synthase inhibitor aureobasidin A (AbA) can enhance the anti-cryptococcal activity of AmB. AbA+AmB AmB had an even better therapeutic effect in a mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis than AmB+flucytosine which may bring new hope for the treatment of Cryptococcal meningitis.<ref>{{Chen, L. et al.

In Africa, oral fluconazole at a rate of 200&nbsp;mg daily is often used. However, this does not result in cure, because it merely suppresses the fungus and does not kill it; viable fungus can continue to be grown from [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of patients not having taken fluconazole for many months.  An increased dose of 400&nbsp;mg daily does not improve outcomes,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Outcome of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis initially treated with 200 mg/day or 400 mg/day of fluconazole |author1=CF Schaars |author2=Meintjes GA |author3=Morroni C | journal=BMC Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=6 | pages=118 | doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-118 | pmid=16846523 | pmc=1540428 |display-authors=etal|hdl=11427/14193 |doi-access=free }}</ref> but prospective studies from [[Uganda]] and Malawi reported that higher doses of 1200&nbsp;mg per day have more fungicidal activity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Longley N, Muzoora C, Taseera K, Mwesigye J, Rwebembera J, Chakera A, Wall E, Andia I, Jaffar S, Harrison TS | year = 2008 | title = Dose response effect of high-dose fluconazole for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in southwestern Uganda | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 1556–61 | doi = 10.1086/593194 | pmid=18990067| doi-access = free }}</ref> The outcomes with fluconazole monotherapy have 30% worse survival than amphotericin-based therapies, in a recent systematic review.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajasingham R, Rolfes MA, Birkenkamp KE, Meya DB, Boulware DR | year = 2012 | title = Cryptococcal meningitis treatment strategies in resource-limited settings: a cost-effectiveness analysis | journal = PLOS Med | volume = 9 | issue = 9| page = e1001316 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001316 | pmid = 23055838 | pmc=3463510 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
