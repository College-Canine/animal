Leptospiral infection in humans causes a range of [[symptom]]s, though some infected persons may have none. The disease begins suddenly with fever accompanied by chills, intense headache, severe [[myalgia|muscle aches]] and abdominal pain.<ref name="Zoey2020"/><ref name="Haake 2015"/> A headache brought on by leptospirosis causes throbbing pain and is characteristically located at the head's bilateral [[Temple (anatomy)|temporal]] or [[frontal bone|frontal]] regions. The person could also have pain behind the eyes and a [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]].<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> Muscle pain usually involves the [[Calf (leg)|calf muscle]] and the lower back.<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> The most characteristic feature of leptospirosis is the [[conjunctival suffusion]] ([[conjunctivitis]] without [[exudate]]) which is rarely found in other [[febrile]] illnesses. Other characteristic findings on the eye include [[subconjunctival bleeding]] and [[jaundice]].<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> A rash is rarely found in leptospirosis. When one is found alternative diagnoses such as [[dengue fever]] and [[chikungunya fever]] should be considered.<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> Dry cough is observed in 20–57% of people with leptospirosis. Thus, this clinical feature can mislead a doctor to diagnose the disease as a respiratory illness. Additionally, [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms such as [[nausea]], vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea frequently occur. Vomiting and diarrhea may contribute to [[dehydration]].<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> The abdominal pain can be due to [[acalculous cholecystitis]] or [[pancreatitis|inflammation of the pancreas]].<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Rarely, the [[Lymphadenopathy|lymph nodes]], [[Hepatomegaly|liver]], and [[Splenomegaly|spleen]] may be enlarged and palpable.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

There will be a resolution of symptoms for one to three days.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> The immune phase starts after this and can last from four to 30 days and can be anything from brain to kidney complications.<ref name="Bennett 2015">{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=John E |last2=Raphael |first2=Dolin |last3=Martin |first3=J Blaser |last4=Bart |first4=J Currie | name-list-style = vanc |title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases|chapter=223 |date=2015 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-1-4557-4801-3 |pages=2541–2549 |edition=Eighth}}</ref> The hallmark of the second phase is [[meningitis|inflammation of the membranes covering the brain]].<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> Signs and symptoms of meningitis include severe headache and neck stiffness.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> Kidney involvement is associated with reduced or absent urine output.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/>

The classic form of severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterised by liver damage (causing jaundice), [[kidney failure]], and bleeding, which happens in 5–10% of those infected.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> Lung and brain damage can also occur. For those with signs of [[meningoencephalitis|inflammation of membranes covering the brain and the brain itself]], [[altered level of consciousness]] can happen. A variety of neurological problems such as [[hemiplegia|paralysis of half of the body]], [[transverse myelitis|complete inflammation of a whole horizontal section of spinal cord]], and [[Guillain-Barré syndrome|muscle weakness due to immune damage of the nerves supplying the muscles]] are the complications.<!-- <ref name="Haake 2015"/> --> Signs of bleeding such as [[petechiae|non-traumatic bruises at {{cvt|1|mm}}]], [[ecchymoses|non-traumatic bruises more than {{cvt|1|cm}}]], [[epistaxis|nose bleeding]], [[melena|blackish stools due to bleeding in the stomach]], [[haematemesis|vomiting blood]] and [[pulmonary haemorrhage|bleeding from the lungs]] can also be found. Prolongation of [[prothrombin time]] in [[coagulation testing]] is associated with severe bleeding manifestation. However, [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]] is not associated with severe bleeding.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Pulmonary haemorrhage is alveolar haemorrhage (bleeding into the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] of the lungs) leading to massive [[haemoptysis|coughing up of blood]], and causing [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], where the risk of death is more than&nbsp;50%.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Rarely, [[myocarditis|inflammation of the heart muscles]], [[pericarditis|inflammation of membranes covering the heart]], [[heart block|abnormalities in the heart's natural pacemaker]] and [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] may occur.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

Leptospirosis is caused by [[spirochaete]] bacteria that belong to the [[genus]] ''[[Leptospira]]'', which are [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]],<ref name="Lane 2016"/> [[Screw thread#Handedness|right-handed]] [[helix|helical]],<ref name=Picardeau2017/> and 6–20&nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometer]]s long.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> Like [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, ''Leptospira'' have an [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] studded with [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) on the surface, an [[Cell membrane|inner membrane]] and a layer of [[peptidoglycan]] cell wall. However, unlike Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer in ''Leptospira'' lies closer to the inner than the outer membrane. This results in a fluid outer membrane loosely associated with the cell wall.<ref name=Cameron2015>{{cite book | vauthors = Cameron CE | title = Leptospira and Leptospirosis | chapter = Leptospiral Structure, Physiology, and Metabolism | series = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology | volume = 387 | pages = 21–41 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25388131 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-45059-8_3 | isbn = 978-3-662-45058-1 }}</ref> In addition, ''Leptospira'' have a [[flagellum]] located in the [[periplasm]], associated with corkscrew style movement.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> [[Chemoreceptor]]s at the poles of the bacteria sense various substrates and change the direction of its movement.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> The bacteria are traditionally visualised using [[dark-field microscopy]] without staining.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/>

A total of 66&nbsp;species of ''Leptospira'' has been identified. Based on their genomic sequence, they are divided into two [[clade]]s and four subclades: P1, P2, S1, and S2.<ref name=Caimi2020>{{cite journal | vauthors = Caimi K, Ruybal P | title = Leptospira spp., a genus in the stage of diversity and genomic data expansion | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 81 | pages = 104241 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32061688 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104241 | bibcode = 2020InfGE..8104241C | s2cid = 211135356 }}</ref> The 19 members of the P1 subclade include the 8 species that can cause severe disease in humans: ''[[Leptospira alexanderi|L.&nbsp;alexanderi]]'', ''[[Leptospira borgpetersenii|L.&nbsp;borgpetersenii]]'', ''[[Leptospira interrogans|L.&nbsp;interrogans]]'', ''[[Leptospira kirschneri|L.&nbsp;kirschneri]]'', ''L.&nbsp;mayottensis'', ''[[Leptospira noguchii|L.&nbsp;noguchii]]'', ''L.&nbsp;santarosai'', and ''[[Leptospira weilii|L.&nbsp;weilii]].''<ref name=Picardeau2017/><ref name=Caimi2020/> The P2 clade comprises 21 species that may cause mild disease in humans. The remaining 26 species comprise the S1 and S2 subclades, which include "saprophytes" known to consume decaying matter ([[saprotrophic nutrition]]).<ref name=Caimi2020/> Pathogenic ''Leptospira'' do not multiply in the environment. ''Leptospira'' require high humidity for survival but can remain alive in environments such as stagnant water or contaminated soil. The bacterium can be killed by temperatures of {{cvt|50|°C}} and can be inactivated by 70%&nbsp;[[ethanol]], 1%&nbsp;[[sodium hypochlorite]], [[formaldehyde]], detergents and acids.<ref name="Spickler 2013"/>

''Leptospira'' are also classified based on their [[serotype|serovar]]. The diverse sugar composition of the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the bacteria is responsible for the antigenic difference between serovars.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> About 300 pathogenic serovars of ''Leptospira'' are recognised. Antigenically related serovars (belonging to the same serogroup) may belong to different species because of [[horizontal gene transfer]] of LPS biosynthetic genes between different species. Currently, the cross [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] absorption test and DNA-DNA hybridisation are used to classify ''Leptospira'' species, but are time-consuming. Therefore, total genomic sequencing could potentially replace these two methods as the new gold standard of classifying ''Leptospira'' species.<ref name=Picardeau2017/>

The number of cases of leptospirosis is directly related to the amount of rainfall, making the disease seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/> The risk of contracting leptospirosis depends upon the risk of disease carriage in the community and the frequency of exposure.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> In rural areas, farming and animal husbandry are the major risk factors for contracting leptospirosis.<ref name="Zoey2020"/> Poor housing and inadequate sanitation also increase the risk of infection.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> In tropical and semi-tropical areas, the disease often becomes [[epidemic|widespread]] after heavy rains or after flooding.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/>

[[File:Pathogeneis of leptospirosis.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt= Diagram showing the pathogenesis of leptospirosis | Ways of ''Leptospira'' bacteria infecting human cells and blood stream<ref name="Chieng 2022"/>]]
When animals ingest the bacteria, they circulate in the bloodstream, then lodge themselves into the kidneys through the [[glomerulus|glomerular]] or [[peritubular capillaries]]. The bacteria then pass into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumens]] of the [[renal tubules]] and colonise the [[brush border]] and [[proximal convoluted tubule]]. This causes the continuous shedding of bacteria in the urine without the animal experiencing significant ill effects. This relationship between the animal and the bacteria is known as a [[commensal relationship]], and the animal is known as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir host]].<ref name="Haake 2015">{{cite book |vauthors=Haake DA, Levett PN |title=Leptospira and Leptospirosis |chapter=Leptospirosis in Humans |publisher=Springer |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |veditors=Adler B |volume=387 |pages=65–97 |date=25 May 2015 |pmid=25388133 |pmc=4442676 |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-45059-8_5 |isbn=978-3-662-45058-1}}</ref>

The bacteria later attach to the [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells of the blood vessels and [[extracellular matrix]] (complex network of proteins and carbohydrates present between cells). The bacteria use their flagella for moving between cell layers. They bind to cells such as [[fibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s, endothelial cells, and kidney epithelial cells.<!-- <ref name=Picardeau2017/> --> They also bind to several human proteins such as complement proteins, [[thrombin]], [[fibrinogen]], and [[plasminogen]] using surface leptospiral [[immunoglobulin superfamily|immunoglobulin-like]] (Lig) proteins such as LigB and LipL32, whose genes are found in all pathogenic species.<ref name=Picardeau2017/><ref name="Kin Chin 2019"/>

Through the [[innate immune system]], endothelial cells of the capillaries in the human body are activated by the presence of these bacteria. The endothelial cells produce [[cytokines]] and [[antimicrobial peptides]] against the bacteria. These products regulate the [[Coagulation#Coagulation cascade|coagulation cascade]] and movements of white blood cells.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> Macrophages presented in humans are able to [[phagocytose|engulf]] ''Leptospira''. However, ''Leptospira'' are able to reside and proliferate in the [[cytosol|cytoplasmic matrix]] after being ingested by macrophages.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> Those with severe leptospirosis can experience a high level of cytokines such as [[interleukin 6]], [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-α), and [[interleukin 10]]. The high level of cytokines causes [[sepsis]]-like symptoms which is life-threatening instead of helping to fight against the infection.<ref name="Cagliero 2018"/> Those who have a high risk of sepsis during a leptospirosis infection are found to have the [[HLA-DQ6]] [[genotype]], possibly due to [[superantigen]] activation, which damages bodily organs.<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

''Leptospira'' LPS only activates [[toll-like receptor 2]] (TLR2) in [[monocyte]]s in humans. The lipid A molecule of the bacteria is not recognised by human [[TLR4]] receptors. Therefore, the lack of ''Leptospira'' recognition by TLR4 receptors probably contributes to the leptospirosis disease process in humans.<ref name=Picardeau2017/>

Although there are various mechanisms in the human body to fight against the bacteria, ''Leptospira'' is well adapted to such an inflammatory condition created by it.<!-- <ref name=Picardeau2017/> --> In the bloodstream, it can activate host plasminogen to become [[plasmin]] that breaks down extracellular matrix, degrades [[fibrin]] clots and complemental proteins ([[C3b]] and [[Complement component 5|C5]]) to avoid [[opsonisation]]. It can also recruit complement regulators such as [[Factor H|Factor''&nbsp;''H]], [[Complement component 4B|C4b]]-binding protein, factor H-like binding protein, and [[vitronectin]] to prevent the activation of [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]] on its surface. It also secretes [[protease]]s to degrade complement proteins such as [[Complement component 3|C3]]. It can bind to thrombin that decreases the fibrin formation. Reduced fibrin formation increases the risk of bleeding.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> ''Leptospira'' also secretes [[sphingomyelinase]] and [[haemolysin]] that target red blood cells.<ref name="Karpagm2020"/>

''Leptospira'' spreads rapidly to all organs through the bloodstream.<ref name=Picardeau2017/> They mainly affect the liver. They invade spaces between [[hepatocyte]]s, causing apoptosis. The damaged hepatocytes and hepatocyte intercellular junctions cause leakage of bile into the bloodstream, causing elevated levels of [[bilirubin]], resulting in jaundice. Congested [[liver sinusoid]]s and [[perisinusoidal space]]s have been reported. Meanwhile, in the lungs, petechiae or frank [[haemorrhage|bleeding]] can be found at the [[alveolar septum]] and spaces between alveoli.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> ''Leptospira'' secretes toxins that cause mild to severe kidney failure or [[interstitial nephritis]].<ref name="Kin Chin 2019"/> The kidney failure can recover completely or lead to [[atrophy]] and [[fibrosis]].<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, coronary arteries, and [[aorta]] are found.<ref name="Bennett 2015"/>

==Diagnosis==

[[File: Diffuse pulmonary haemorrhages of the lungs infected by leptospirosis.png|thumb|alt=X-ray showing lungs bleeding due to leptospirosis infection | Diffuse lungs bleeding due to leptospirosis infection<ref name="Chieng 2022"/>]]

===Laboratory tests===
For those who are infected, a [[complete blood count]] may show a [[leukocytosis|high white cell count]] and a low platelet count. When a [[anaemia|low haemoglobin count]] is present together with a [[leukopenia|low white cell count]] and [[thrombocytopenia]], [[bone marrow suppression]] should be considered.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] and [[C-reactive protein]] may also be elevated.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

The kidneys are commonly involved in leptospirosis. Blood [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] levels will be elevated. Leptospirosis increases potassium excretion in urine, which leads to a [[hypokalemia|low potassium level]]<ref name="Haake 2015"/> and a [[hyponatremia|low sodium level]] in the blood.<ref name="Lane 2016"/><ref name="Haake 2015"/> Urinalysis may reveal the [[proteinuria|presence of protein]], [[pyuria|white blood cells]], and microscopic [[haematuria]].<ref name="Lane 2016"/> Because the bacteria settle in the kidneys, urine cultures will be positive for leptospirosis starting after the second week of illness until 30 days of infection.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

For those with liver involvement, [[transaminase]]s and direct bilirubin are elevated in [[liver function test]]s. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup is associated with jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels. [[Hemolytic anemia]] contributes to jaundice. A feature of leptospirosis is acute [[haemolytic anaemia]] and [[Conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugated]] hyperbilirubinemia, especially in patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]].<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Abnormal [[serum (blood)|serum]] [[amylase]] and lipase levels (associated with pancreatitis) are found in those who are admitted to hospital due to leptospirosis. Impaired kidney function with [[creatinine clearance]] less than 50 ml/min is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes.<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

For those with severe headache who show signs of meningitis, a [[lumbar puncture]] can be attempted. If infected, [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) examination shows [[Lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] predominance with a cell count of about&nbsp;500/mm<sup>3</sup>, protein between&nbsp;50 and 100&nbsp;mg/mL and normal glucose levels. These findings are consistent with [[aseptic meningitis]].<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

====Serological tests====
Rapid detection of ''Leptospira'' can be done by quantifying the IgM antibodies using an [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)]]. Typically, ''L.&nbsp;biflexa'' antigen is used to detect the IgM antibodies. This test can quickly determine the diagnosis and help in early treatment. However, the test specificity depends upon the type of antigen used and the presence of antibodies from previous infections. The presence of other diseases such as [[Epstein–Barr virus]] infection, viral [[hepatitis]], and [[cytomegalovirus]] infection can cause false-positive results.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Other rapid screening tests have been developed such as dipsticks, [[Latex fixation test|latex]] and slide agglutination tests.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the reference test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> MAT is a test where serial dilutions of patient sera are mixed with different serovars of ''Leptospira''. The mixture is then examined under a [[dark field microscopy|dark field microscope]] to look for [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]]. The highest dilution where 50%&nbsp;agglutination occurs is the result.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> MAT [[titer|titres]] of 1:100 to 1:800 are diagnostic of leptospirosis.<ref name="Lane 2016"/> A fourfold or greater rise in titre of two sera taken at symptoms' onset and three to 10&nbsp;days of disease onset confirms the diagnosis. During the acute phase of the disease, MAT is not specific in detecting a serotype of ''Leptospira'' because of cross-reactivity between the serovars.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> In the [[convalescent]] phase, MAT is more specific in detecting the serovar types.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> MAT requires a panel of live antigens and requires laborious work.<ref name="Bennett 2015"/>

====Molecular tests====
Leptospiral DNA can be amplified by using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) from serum, urine, [[aqueous humour]], CSF, and autopsy specimens.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> It detects the presence of bacteria faster than MAT during the first few days of infection without waiting for the appearance of antibodies.<ref name="Bennett 2015"/> As PCR detects the presence of leptospiral DNA in the blood it is useful even when the bacteria is killed by antibiotics.<ref name="Alison 2016">{{cite journal |last1=Alison |first1=B Lane |last2=Michael |first2=M Dore | name-list-style = vanc |title=Leptospirosis: A clinical review of evidence based diagnosis, treatment and prevention |journal=[[World Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |date=25 November 2016 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=61–66 |doi=10.5495/wjcid.v6.i4.61|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Imaging===
In those who have lung involvement, a chest X-ray may demonstrate diffuse alveolar opacities.<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

===Diagnostic criteria===
In 1982, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) proposed the Faine's criteria for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. It consists of three parts: A (clinical findings), B (epidemiological factors), and C (lab findings and bacteriological data). Since the original Faine's criteria only included culture and MAT in part C, which is difficult and complex to perform, the modified Faine's criteria were proposed in 2004 to include ELISA and slide agglutination tests which are easier to perform. In 2012, modified Faine's criteria (with amendment) was proposed to include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]] and coughing up blood in the diagnosis. In 2013, India recommended modified Faine's criteria in the diagnosis of leptospirosis.<ref name="Kumar India">{{cite book | vauthors = Kumar SS |title=Indian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Human Leptospirosis |date=2013 |location=India |pages=23–29 |chapter-url=http://www.apiindia.org/medicine_update_2013/chap07.pdf |access-date=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225181953/http://www.apiindia.org/medicine_update_2013/chap07.pdf |archive-date=25 December 2016 |chapter=7}}</ref>

Rates of leptospirosis can be reduced by improving housing, infrastructure, and sanitation standards. Rodent abatement efforts and flood mitigation projects can also help to prevent it.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Proper use of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) by people who have a high risk of occupational exposure can prevent leptospirosis infections in most cases.<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

==Treatment==
Most leptospiral cases resolve spontaneously. Early initiation of antibiotics may prevent the progression to severe disease. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, antibiotics can be started once leptospirosis is suspected after history taking and examination.<ref name="Haake 2015"/>

For mild leptospirosis, antibiotic recommendations such as doxycycline, [[azithromycin]], [[ampicillin]] and [[amoxicillin]] were based solely on ''in vitro'' testing.<ref name="Lane 2016"/> In 2001, the WHO recommended oral doxycycline (2&nbsp;mg/kg up to 100&nbsp;mg every 12&nbsp;hours) for five to seven days for those with mild leptospirosis. [[Tetracycline]], ampicillin, and amoxicillin can also be used in such cases.<ref name="WHO"/> However, in areas where both [[rickettsia]] and leptospirosis are endemic, azithromycin and doxycycline are the drugs of choice.<ref name="Lane 2016"/>

==Prognosis==
The overall risk of death for leptospirosis is 5–10%.<ref name="Evangelista2010"/> For those with jaundice, the case fatality can increase up to&nbsp;15%.<ref name="Spickler 2013"/> For those infected who present with confusion and neurological signs, there is a high risk of death.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> Other factors that increase the risk of death include reduced urine output, age more than 36&nbsp;years, and respiratory failure.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> With proper care, most of those infected will recover completely. Those with acute kidney failure may develop persistent mild kidney impairment after they recover.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> In those with severe lung involvement, the risk of death is 50–70%.<ref name="Lane 2016"/> Thirty percent of people with acute leptospirosis complained of long-lasting symptoms characterised by weakness, muscle pain, and headaches.<ref name="Haake 2015" />

===Eye complications===
Eye problems can occur in 10% of those who recovered from leptospirosis<ref name="Spickler 2013"/> in the range from two weeks to a few years post-infection. Most commonly, eye complications can occur at six months after the infection. This is due to the [[Immune privilege#Eye|immune privilege]] of the eye which protects it from immunological damage during the initial phase of leptospiral infection.<ref name="Verma 2012">{{cite journal

''Leptospira'' was first observed in 1907 in a [[post mortem]] kidney tissue slice by Arthur Stimson using [[Silver staining|silver deposition staining]] technique.

In Japan, the organism was named ''Spirocheta icterohaemorrhagiae''. The Japanese group also experimented with the first leptospiral immunisation studies in guinea pigs. They demonstrated that by injecting the infected [[guinea pig]]s with sera from convalescent humans or goats, [[passive immunity]] could be provided to the guinea pigs. In 1917, the Japanese group discovered rats as the carriers of leptospirosis.<ref name="Ben Adler 2015"/> Unaware of the Japanese group's work, two German groups independently and almost simultaneously published their first demonstration of transmitting leptospiral infection in guinea pigs in October 1915. They named the organism ''Spirochaeta nodosa'' and ''Spirochaeta Icterogenes'' respectively.<ref name="Ben Adler 2015"/>

Leptospirosis was subsequently recognised as a disease of all mammalian species. In 1933, Dutch workers reported the isolation of ''Leptospira canicola'' which specifically infects dogs. In 1940, the strain that specifically infects cattle was first reported in Russia.<ref name="Ben Adler 2015"/> In 1942, soldiers at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], were recorded to have an infectious disease which caused a rash over their [[shinbone]]s. This disease was later known to be caused by leptospirosis.<ref name="Haake 2015"/> By the 1950s, the number of serovars that infected various mammals had expanded significantly. In the 1980s, leptospirosis was recognised as a veterinary disease of major economic importance.<ref name="Ben Adler 2015"/>

In 1982, there were about 200 serovars of ''Leptospira'' available for classification. The [[International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology]]'s subcommittee on taxonomy of ''Leptospira'' proposed classifying these serovars into two big groups: ''L.&nbsp;interrogans'' containing pathogenic serovars and ''L.&nbsp;biflexa'' containing saprophytic serovars.<ref name="Ben Adler 2015"/> In 1979, the leptospiral family of ''Leptospiraceae'' was proposed.

ELISA and microscopic agglutination tests are most commonly used to diagnose leptospirosis in animals. The bacteria can be detected in blood, urine, and milk or liver, kidney, or other tissue samples by using [[immunofluorescence]] or [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] or polymerase chain reaction techniques. Silver staining or immunogold silver staining is used to detect ''Leptospira'' in tissue sections. The organisms stain poorly with [[Gram stain]]. Dark-field microscopy can be used to detect ''Leptospira'' in body fluids, but it is neither sensitive nor specific in detecting the organism.<!-- <ref name="Spickler 2013"/> --> A positive culture for leptospirosis is definitive, but the availability is limited, and culture results can take&nbsp;13–26 weeks for a result, limiting its utility.<!-- <ref name="Spickler 2013"/> --> Paired acute and convalescent samples are preferred for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis in animals.

Various antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillins, [[dihydrostreptomycin]], and [[streptomycin]] have been used to treat leptospirosis in animals.

Leptospirosis vaccines are available for animals such as pigs, dogs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Vaccines for cattle usually contain ''Leptospira'' serovar Hardjo and Pomona, for dogs, the vaccines usually contain serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola.<!-- <ref name="Spickler 2013"/> --> Vaccines containing multiple serovars do not work for cattle as well as vaccines containing a single serovar, yet the multivalent vaccines continue to be sold.<ref name="Ellis2015"/> Isolation of infected animals and prophylactic antibiotics are also effective in preventing leptospirosis transmission between animals.
