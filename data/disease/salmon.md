'''Salmon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|m|ən}}; {{plural form}}: salmon) is the [[common name]] for several [[list of commercially important fish species|commercially important]] [[species]] of [[euryhaline]] [[ray-finned fish]] from the [[genera]] ''[[Salmo]]'' and ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Salmonidae]], native to [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[North Atlantic]] (''Salmo'') and [[North Pacific]] (''Oncorhynchus'') basins. Other closely related fish in the same family include [[trout]], [[Salvelinus|char]], [[Thymallus|grayling]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[lenok]] and [[Hucho|taimen]], all [[coldwater fish]] of the [[subarctic]] and cooler [[temperate]] regions with some sporadic [[endorheic]] populations in [[Central Asia]].

Salmon are typically [[fish migration|anadromous]]: they hatch in the shallow [[gravel]] [[stream bed|bed]]s of [[freshwater]] [[headstream]]s and spend their [[juvenile fish|juvenile]] years in [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and freshwater [[wetland]]s, migrate to the [[ocean]] as [[adult]]s and live like [[sea fish]], then [[natal homing|return to their freshwater birthplace]] to [[reproduce]]. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh waters (i.e. landlocked) throughout their lives. [[Folklore]] has it that the fish return to the exact [[stream]] where they themselves hatched to [[spawn (biology)|spawn]], and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning [[salmon run]] may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/publications/scipubs/techmemos/tm30/quinn.html |title=NOAA/NMFS/NWFSC-TM30: Homing, Straying, and Colonization |publisher=U.S. Dept Commerce/NOAA/NMFS/NWFSC/Publications |access-date=11 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120031309/https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/publications/scipubs/techmemos/tm30/quinn.html |archive-date=20 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Homing behavior has been shown to depend on [[olfactory memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scholz AT, Horrall RM, Cooper JC, Hasler AD |title=Imprinting to chemical cues: The basis for home stream selection in salmon |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4245 |pages=1247–9 |pmid=1273590 |year=1976 |doi=10.1126/science.1273590 |bibcode=1976Sci...192.1247S |s2cid=11248713}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ueda H |title=Physiological mechanism of homing migration in Pacific salmon from behavioral to molecular biological approaches |journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=222–32 |pmid=20144612 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2010.02.003 |hdl=2115/44787 |s2cid=205779299 |url=https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/44787/1/GCE_170.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/44787/1/GCE_170.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |hdl-access=free}}</ref>

==Name and etymology==
The Modern English term ''salmon'' is derived from {{lang-enm|samoun}}, {{lang|enm|samon}} and {{lang|enm|saumon}}, which in turn are from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]: ''saumon'', from {{lang-fro|saumon}}, and from {{lang-lat|salmō}} (which in turn might have originated from ''salire'', meaning "to leap".<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=Salmon (n) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=salmon |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=25 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402194009/https://www.etymonline.com/word/salmon |archive-date=2 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>). The unpronounced "l" absent from Middle English was later added as a [[Latinism|Latinisation]] to make the word closer to its Latin root. The term ''salmon'' has mostly displaced its now dialectal synonym ''lax'', in turn from {{lang-enm|lax}}, from {{lang-ang|leax}}, from {{lang-gem-x-proto|lahsaz}} from [[Proto-Indo-European]]: ''*lakso-''.<ref name="salmon">{{cite web |title=salmon |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/salmon |website=Wiktionary |access-date=1 January 2023 |language=en |date=31 December 2022}}</ref><ref name="lax">{{cite web |title=lax |url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lax#English |website=Wiktionary |access-date=1 January 2023 |language=en |date=12 December 2022}}</ref>

== Species ==
The seven commercially important species of salmon occur in two genera of the [[subfamily]] [[Salmoninae]]. The genus ''[[Salmo]]'' contains the [[Atlantic salmon]], found in both sides of the [[North Atlantic]], as well as more than 40 other species commonly named as [[trout]]. The genus ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' contains 12 recognised species which occur naturally only in the North Pacific, six of which are known as [[Pacific salmon]] while the remainder are considered trout. Outside their native habitats, [[Chinook salmon]] have been successfully introduced in [[New Zealand]] and [[Patagonia]], while [[coho salmon|coho]], [[sockeye salmon|sockeye]] and Atlantic salmon have been established in Patagonia, as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalflyfisher.com/fishbetter/patagonian-salmonids/ |title=Patagonian salmonids-This is the history and present state of salmonid introduction in Patagonia |date=25 August 2011 |author=Heiko Schneider |publisher=Global Fly Fisher |access-date=25 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235535/http://globalflyfisher.com/fishbetter/patagonian-salmonids/ |archive-date=26 April 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

<small> &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>†</sup> Both the ''Salmo'' and ''Oncorhynchus'' genera also contain a number of [[trout]] species informally referred to as salmon. Within ''Salmo'', the [[Adriatic salmon]] (''Salmo obtusirostris'') and [[Black Sea salmon]] (''Salmo labrax'') have both been named as salmon in [[English language|English]], although they fall outside the generally recognized seven salmon species. The [[masu salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus masou'') is actually considered a trout ("cherry trout") in [[Japan]], with ''masu'' actually being the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for trout. On the other hand, the [[steelhead]] and [[sea trout]], the anadromous forms of [[rainbow trout]] and [[brown trout]] respectively, are from the same genera as salmon and live identical migratory lives, but neither is termed "salmon" .</small>

{{common fish}}

The extinct ''[[Eosalmo driftwoodensis]]'', the oldest known [[Salmoninae]] fish in the [[fossil record]], helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon diverged from a [[common ancestor]]. The [[Eocene]] salmon's fossil from  [[British Columbia]] provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic salmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20 million years ago during the [[Miocene]]. This independent evidence from [[DNA analysis]] and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long before the [[Quaternary glaciation]] began the cycle of [[glacial]] advance and retreat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Montgomery |first=David |year=2004 |title=King of Fish |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=0813342996 |pages=27–28 }}</ref>

=== Non-salmon species of "salmon" ===
There are several other species of fish which are colloquially called "salmon" but are not true salmon. Of those listed below, the Danube salmon or ''[[huchen]]'' is a large freshwater [[salmonid]] closely related (from the same subfamily) to the seven species of salmon above, but others are fishes of unrelated [[order (biology)|order]]s, given the common name "salmon" simply due to similar shapes, behaviors and [[ecological niche|niche]]s occupied:

*[[Atlantic salmon]] (''Salmo salar'') reproduce in northern rivers on both coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.
**Landlocked Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'' m. ''sebago'') is a [[potamodromous]] (migratory only between fresh waters) [[subspecies]]/[[morph (biology)|morph]] that live in a number of lakes in eastern North America and in Northern Europe, for instance in lakes [[Lake Sebago|Sebago]], [[Lake Onega|Onega]], [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]], [[Saimaa]], [[Vänern]] and [[Lake Winnipesaukee|Winnipesaukee]]. They are not a different species from the sea-run Atlantic salmon but have independently evolved a freshwater-only life cycle, which they maintain even when they could access the ocean.

Salmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes. The [[Fish egg|eggs]] hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with [[Fish scale|scales]] that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Salmon's Life: An Incredible Journey |url=http://www.blm.gov/education/00_resources/articles/Columbia_river_basin/posterback.html|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Land Management |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225075127/http://www.blm.gov/education/00_resources/articles/Columbia_river_basin/posterback.html |archive-date=25 February 2009}}</ref>

The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are [[Fish migration|anadromous]] and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to [[osmoregulation]] in the ocean. This body chemistry change is hormone-driven, causing physiological adjustments in the function of osmoregulatory organs such as the gills, which leads to large increases in their ability to secrete salt.<ref>{{Citation |last=McCormick |first=Stephen D. |title=5 - Smolt Physiology and Endocrinology |date=1 January 2012 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123969514000050 |work=Fish Physiology |volume=32 |pages=199–251 |editor-last=McCormick |editor-first=Stephen D. |series=Euryhaline Fishes |publisher=Academic Press |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-396951-4.00005-0 |isbn=9780123969514 |language=en |access-date=26 October 2020 |editor2-last=Farrell |editor2-first=Anthony P. |editor3-last=Brauner |editor3-first=Colin J.}}</ref> Hormones involved in increasing [[salinity tolerance]] include [[insulin-like growth factor I]], [[cortisol]], and [[thyroid hormones]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Björnsson |first1=Björn Th. |last2=Hansson |first2=Tiiu |date=February 1983 |title=Effects of hypophysectomy on the plasma ionic and osmotic balance in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(83)90140-5 |journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=240–247 |doi=10.1016/0016-6480(83)90140-5 |pmid=6840518 |issn=0016-6480}}</ref> which permits the fish to endure the transition from a freshwater environment to the ocean.

The salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature. The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea. When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last1 = Vladić | editor-first1 = Tomislav | editor-last2 = Petersson | editor-first2 = Erik | year = 2015 | edition = 1st | title = Evolutionary Biology of the Atlantic Salmon | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 978-1466598485 }}</ref>{{Page needed | date = May 2019}}

Prior to spawning, depending on the [[species]], salmon undergo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a [[kype]] (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon). All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over {{convert|900|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} and climb nearly {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts. In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as [[semelparity]]. Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once ([[iteroparity]]), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).

[[File:Redds.jpg|thumb|right|Redds on riverbed]]

To lay her [[roe]], the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd. The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering {{convert|30|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|first=Susan |last=McGrath |title=Spawning Hope |publisher=Audubon Society |url=http://www.audubonmagazine.org/features0309/hope.html |access-date=17 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063039/http://www.audubonmagazine.org/features0309/hope.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The eggs usually range from orange to red.

The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.<ref name="USFWS" />

Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter. This results in ring formation around an earbone called the [[otolith]] (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.

Freshwater streams and [[estuary|estuaries]] provide important habitat for many salmon species. They feed on [[insects|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic insects]], [[amphipods]], and other [[crustaceans]] while young, and primarily on other fish when older. Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos. Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow. [[Estuaries]] and their associated [[wetlands]] provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean. Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.

Salmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration ([[phenoptosis]], or "programmed aging") at the end of their lives. Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of [[corticosteroid]]s.

== Diet ==
Salmon are mid-[[trophic level|level]] [[carnivore]]s whose diet change according to their life stage. Salmon [[fry (fish)|fry]] predominantly feed upon [[zooplankton]]s until they reach [[Fingerling (fish)|fingerling]] sizes, when they start to consume more aquatic [[invertebrate]]s such as [[insect larvae]], micro[[crustacean]]s and [[worm]]s. As [[juvenile fish|juvenile]]s (parrs), they become more predatory and actively prey upon [[aquatic insect]]s, small crustaceans, [[tadpole]]s and small [[bait fish]]es. They are also known to breach the water to attack terrestrial insects such as [[grasshopper]]s and [[dragonflies]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Glatz |first=Kyle |date=7 December 2021 |title=What Do Salmon Eat? 12 Foods in Their Diet |url=https://a-z-animals.com/blog/what-do-salmon-eat/ |access-date=15 July 2022 |website=AZ Animals |language=en-US}}</ref> as well as consuming [[fish egg]]s (even those of other salmon).

As adults, salmon behave like other mid-sized [[pelagic fish]], eating a variety of sea creatures including smaller [[forage fish]] such as [[lanternfish]], [[herring]]s, [[sand lance]]s, [[mackerel]]s and [[barracudina]]. They also eat [[krill]], [[squid]] and [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fisheries |first=NOAA |date=3 May 2022 |title=Fun Facts About Amazing Atlantic Salmon {{!}} NOAA Fisheries |url=https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/outreach-and-education/fun-facts-about-amazing-atlantic-salmon |access-date=15 July 2022 |website=NOAA |language=en}}</ref>

==Ecology==
[[File:Cub with trophy.jpg|thumb|left|Bear cub with salmon]]
{{see also|Salmon run}}
In the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Alaska]], salmon are [[keystone species]].<ref name=Willson/> The migration of salmon represent a massive retrograde [[nutrient]] transfer, rich in [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[carbon]] and [[phosphorus]], from the ocean to the inland [[freshwater ecosystem]]s. Predation by [[piscivorous]] land animals (such as [[osprey]]s, [[bear]]s and [[otter]]s) along the journey serve to transfer the nutrients from the water to land, and [[decomposition]] of salmon carcass benefits the [[forest ecosystem]].

In the case of [[Pacific salmon]], most (if not all) of the salmon that survive to reach the [[headwater]] spawning grounds will [[semelparity|die after laying eggs]] and their dead bodies sink to cover the gravel beds, with the nutrients released from the [[biodegradation]] of their corpses providing a significant boost to these otherwise [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]-poor shallow streams.

===Bears===
[[Grizzly bear]]s function as [[ecosystem engineer]]s, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent dry land to eat the fish. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses. Bears preparing for [[hibernation]] tend to preferentially consume the more nutrient- and [[food energy|energy]]-rich [[salmon roe]]s and [[brain]] over the actual [[flesh]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Consumption choice by bears feeding on salmon|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420000590|last1=Gende |first1=S.M.|last2=Quinn|first2=T.P.|last3=Willson|first3=M.F.|date=2001-05-01|journal=[[Oecologia]]|volume=127|issue=3|pages=372–382|doi=10.1007/s004420000590|pmid=28547108 |bibcode=2001Oecol.127..372G |s2cid=41395058 |accessdate=2023-09-14}}</ref> and are estimated to discard up to half the salmon they've harvested uneaten on the forest floor,<ref name=Reimchen2001/><ref name=Quinn2009/> in densities that can reach {{cvt|4000|kg}} per hectare,<ref name=Reimchen2002/> providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the [[riparian]] [[woodland]]s.

===Beavers===
[[File:Sockeye salmon jumping over beaver dam Lake Aleknagik, AK Kristina Ramstad 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Sockeye salmon jumping over beaver dam]]

[[Beaver]]s also function as ecosystem engineers; in the process of tree-cutting and [[beaver dam|dam]]ming, beavers alter the local ecosystems extensively. Beaver ponds can provide critical habitat for [[juvenile salmon]].

An example of this was seen in the years following 1818 in the [[Columbia River]] Basin. In 1818, the British government made an agreement with the U.S. government to allow U.S. citizens access to the Columbia catchment (see [[Treaty of 1818]]). At the time, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] sent word to [[fur trapping|trappers]] to extirpate all furbearers from the area in an effort to make the area less attractive to U.S. fur traders. In response to the elimination of beavers from large parts of the river system, [[salmon run]]s plummeted, even in the absence of many of the factors usually associated with the demise of salmon runs. Salmon recruitment can be affected by beavers' dams because dams can:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Extinction.asp | title = Extinction | publisher = Northwest Power and Conservation Council | access-date = 21 December 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180101173222/https://www.nwcouncil.org/history/Extinction | archive-date = 1 January 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Sockeye salmon (''Oncorhynchus nerka'') nursery lake fertilization: Review and summary of results |journal=Environmental Reviews|volume=12|issue=3|pages=133–162|doi=10.1139/a04-008|year=2004|last1=Hyatt|first1=K D|last2=McQueen|first2=D J|last3=Shortreed|first3=K S|last4=Rankin|first4=D P|s2cid=12930576| url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0cfb/39999bce91178a1091a58a6f8f9d090570cb.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807012439/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0cfb/39999bce91178a1091a58a6f8f9d090570cb.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=7 August 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://rocky.ess.washington.edu/grg/publications/pdfs/Pollock.pdf | title = The Importance of Beaver Ponds to Coho Salmon Production in the Stillaguamish River Basin, Washington, USA | last1 = Pollock | first1 = M.

*Slow the rate at which nutrients are flushed from the water system; nutrients provided by adult salmon dying throughout the fall and winter remain available in the spring to newly hatched juveniles
*Provide deeper [[salmon pool]]s where young salmon can avoid avian predators

Beaver dams are able to nurture salmon juveniles in estuarine [[tidal marsh]]es where the salinity is less than 10&nbsp;ppm. Beavers build small dams of generally less than {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on|order=flip}} high in channels in the [[myrtle zone]]{{Clarify | date = May 2019 | reason = What's a 'myrtle zone'}}. These dams can be overtopped at high tide and hold water at low tide.

===Lampreys===
It has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous [[lamprey]]s, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way. Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream. Also, along with species like [[rainbow trout]] and [[Sacramento sucker]], lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning.<ref>{{cite web | date = 19 January 2010 | title = Yuba River Steelhead Redd Surveys (preliminary draft) | url = http://www.yubaaccordrmt.com/Study%20Protocols/Steelhead%20Redd%202010%20Study%20Plan%201-19-10%20(deepwater%20strikeout).pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180429222315/http://www.yubaaccordrmt.com/Study%20Protocols/Steelhead%20Redd%202010%20Study%20Plan%201-19-10%20(deepwater%20strikeout).pdf | archive-date = 29 April 2018 | url-status = live | publisher =  Yuba River Management Team (RMT) Web Site, Yuba County Water Agency }}</ref> Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are [[filter feeder]]s which contribute to the health of the waters.

===Parasites===
{{main|Diseases and parasites in salmon}}
According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the [[myxozoa]]n parasite ''[[Henneguya salminicola]]'' is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the [[Haida Gwaii Islands]]. The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid. This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.
[[File:Henneguya salminicola in flesh of coho salmon, BC, Canada.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Henneguya salminicola]]'', a [[myxozoa]]n parasite commonly found in the flesh of salmonids on the West Coast of Canada, in coho salmon]]

''Henneguya'' and other parasites in the [[myxosporean]] group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts. The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the ''Henneguya'' case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes [[whirling disease]] in trout has a similar life cycle.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/ansrp/myxobolus_cerebralis.pdf | title = Whirling Disease&nbsp;- ''Myxobolus cerebralis'' | access-date = 13 December 2007 | first1 = Danielle M. | last1 = Crosier | first2 = Daniel P. | last2 = Molloy | first3 = Jerri | last3 = Bartholomew | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216100913/http://el.erdc.usace.army.mil/ansrp/myxobolus_cerebralis.pdf | archive-date = 16 February 2008 }}</ref> However, as opposed to whirling disease, the ''Henneguya'' infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon—even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.

According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on ''Henneguya salminicola'' was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2013/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-1405-eng.pdf | title = Investigation of the Distribution, Detection, and Biology of Henneguya salminicola (Protozoa, Myxozoa), a Parasite of the Flesh of Pacific Salmon | last1 = Boyce | first1 = N.P. | last2 = Kabata | first2 = Z. | last3 = Margolis | first3 = L. | year = 1985 | journal = Canadian Technical Report of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | issue = 1450 | page = 55 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112112222/http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2013/mpo-dfo/Fs97-6-1405-eng.pdf | archive-date = 12 November 2014 | url-status = live}}</ref> which states, "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of [[prevalence]], coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink. As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as [[Fraser River|Fraser]], [[Skeena River|Skeena]], [[Nass River|Nass]] and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., "are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection." The report also states, "It should be stressed that ''Henneguya'', economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of [[public health]]. It is strictly a [[fish parasite]] that cannot live in or affect [[warm blooded]] animals, including man".

According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]], "''Henneguya salminicola'' is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon. I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in [[Barkley Sound]] (southern B.C., west coast of [[Vancouver Island]]) are noted for their high incidence of infestation."{{Citation needed | date = May 2019 | reason = This paragraph appears to be sentences that are copied from website to website with unclear origin; would improve reliability if primary source is specified.}}

{{Main|Aquaculture of salmon}}
Salmon [[aquaculture]] is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10&nbsp;billion annually. Other commonly cultured fish species include [[tilapia]], [[catfish]], [[Barred sand bass|sea bass]], [[carp]] and [[bream]]. Salmon farming is significant in [[Chile]], [[Norway]], [[Scotland]], Canada and the [[Faroe Islands]]; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe. Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and [[Tasmania]], Australia.

Salmon are [[carnivorous]], and need to be fed meals produced from catching other wild [[forage fish]] and other marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild [[forage fish]]. As a predator, salmon require large nutritional intakes of [[protein]], and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. On a dry weight basis, 2–4&nbsp;kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kilogram of salmon.<ref>{{cite web | first = Rosamond L. | last = Naylor | title = Nature's Subsidies to Shrimp and Salmon Farming | url = http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/solutions/documents/science1998.pdf | publisher = Science; 10/30/98, Vol. 282 Issue 5390, p883 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326171021/http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/solutions/documents/science1998.pdf | archive-date = 26 March 2009}}</ref> As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their [[maximum sustainable yield]].<ref name="Alliance">{{cite web | date = 2005 | title = It's all about salmon | url = http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf | url-status = dead | publisher = [[Seafood Choices Alliance]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095748/http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf | archive-date = 24 September 2015 }}</ref> The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of other wild predatory fish which rely on them for food.

Intensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs. It has the drawback of allowing disease and [[sea lice]] to spread to local wild salmon stocks.<ref>{{cite news | title = Fish farms drive wild salmon populations toward extinction | date = 13 December 2007 | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-12/s-ffd120707.php | publisher = [[SeaWeb]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181125114015/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-12/s-ffd120707.php | archive-date = 25 November 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>

[[File:Salmon newborn.jpg|thumb|right|Artificially incubated [[chum salmon]] [[juvenile fish|fries]]]]
Another form of salmon production, which is safer but less controllable, is to raise salmon in [[hatchery|hatcheries]] until they are old enough to become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as [[ranching]]. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.

Because of this, the ranching method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non-profit groups, such as the [[Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association]], as a way to increase salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to [[overharvest]]ing, construction of [[dam]]s and [[habitat destruction]] or [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]. Negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation include genetic "dilution" of the wild stocks. Many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls, and habitat improvement and protection.

A variant method of [[fish stocking]], called ocean ranching, is under development in [[Alaska]]. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released, where fishermen can catch them.

An alternative method to hatcheries is to use spawning channels. These are [[canal|artificial stream]]s, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or rip-rap sides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped into the top of the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of the lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be cleaned out to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods that destroy natural redds also clean the regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.{{Citation needed | date = May 2019 }}

One proposed alternative to the use of wild-caught fish as feed for the salmon, is the use of [[soy]]-based products. This should be better for the local environment of the fish farm, but producing soy beans has a high environmental cost for the producing region. The fish omega-3 fatty acid content would be reduced compared to fish-fed salmon.

Another possible alternative is a yeast-based coproduct of [[bioethanol]] production, [[protein]]aceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed can result in equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish.<ref name="autogenerated56">{{cite web | date = November 2010 | title = The Future of Aquafeeds: DRAFT for public comment | url = http://aquaculture.noaa.gov/pdf/feeds/aquafeedsrept_nov2010.pdf | url-status = dead | publisher = NOAA/USDA Alternative Feeds Initiative | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015043844/http://aquaculture.noaa.gov/pdf/feeds/aquafeedsrept_nov2010.pdf | archive-date = 15 October 2011 | page = 56}}</ref> With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs for buying hatchery [[fish feed]].

To the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], salmon is considered a vital part of the diet.

[[American black bear|Black bear]]s also rely on salmon as food. The leftovers the bears leave behind are considered important nutrients for the [[forests of Canada|Canadian forest]], such as the soil, trees and plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of temperature and water flow in times of high and low rainfall.<ref name="haidanation1"/> However, the condition of the salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to logging and development, much of the salmon's habitat (i.e., [[Ain River (Haida Gwaii)|Ain River]]) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered.<ref name="haidanation1"/> For residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, in turn, has affected families diets, and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger include: the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers.<ref name="haidanation1"/> It is clear that further protection is needed for salmon, such as their habitats, where logging commonly occurs.

Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based on the inconsistent historical data, but there has been massive depletion since the 1900s. The [[Pacific Northwest]] once sprawled with native inhabitants who ensured little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As [[animist]]s, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left little waste by turning the bladder into glue, and using bones for toys and skin for clothing and shoes. The original salmon ceremony, introduced by indigenous tribes on the Pacific coast, consisted of three major parts. First was the welcoming of the first catch, and then the cooking of it. Finally the bones were returned to the sea to induce hospitality so other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 40316132|title = The Fish God Gave Us: The First Salmon Ceremony Revived|journal = Arctic Anthropology|volume = 24|issue = 1|pages = 56–66|last1 = Amoss|first1 = Pamela T.|year = 1987}}</ref>

<blockquote>''The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a fraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able to agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.''</blockquote>

However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon is also one of the incarnations of both [[Tuan mac Cairill]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/tuan.html | title = The Story of Tuan mac Cairill | publisher = Maryjones.us | access-date = 18 March 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100327224754/http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/tuan.html | archive-date = 27 March 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and [[Fintan mac Bóchra]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://celt.ucc.ie//published/G109001/index.html | title = The Colloquy between Fintan and the Hawk of Achill | publisher = Ucc.ie | access-date = 18 March 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181231091226/https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G109001/index.html | archive-date = 31 December 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>

Salmon also feature in [[Welsh mythology]]. In the prose tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', the Salmon of Llyn Llyw is the oldest animal in Britain, and the only creature who knows the location of [[Mabon ap Modron]]. After speaking to a string of other ancient animals who do not know his whereabouts, [[King Arthur]]'s men [[Sir Kay|Cai]] and [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]] are led to the Salmon of Llyn Llyw, who lets them ride its back to the walls of Mabon's prison in [[Gloucester]].<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Parker | first1 = Will | title = Culhwch ac Olwen: A translation of the oldest Arthurian tale | url = http://www.culhwch.info/ | website = Culhwch ac Olwen | access-date = 17 January 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181116154509/http://www.culhwch.info/ | archive-date = 16 November 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref>

In [[Norse mythology]], after [[Loki]] tricked the blind god [[Höðr]] into killing his brother [[Baldr]], Loki jumped into a river and transformed himself into a salmon to escape punishment from the other [[Æsir|gods]]. When they held out a net to trap him he attempted to leap over it but was caught by [[Thor]] who grabbed him by the tail with his hand, and this is why the salmon's tail is tapered.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe10.htm | title = The Poetic Edda | translator = Henry Adams Bellows | access-date = 27 April 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190506071029/http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe10.htm | archive-date = 6 May 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref>

Salmon are central spiritually and culturally to [[Native American mythology]] on the Pacific coast, from the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Coast Salish]] peoples, to the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]]s in [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Tribal Salmon Culture: Salmon Culture of the Pacific Northwest Tribes | url = http://www.critfc.org/salmon-culture/tribal-salmon-culture/ | publisher = Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190513060812/https://www.critfc.org/salmon-culture/tribal-salmon-culture/ | archive-date = 13 May 2019 | url-status = live}}</ref>
