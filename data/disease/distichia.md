A '''distichia''' is an [[eyelash]] that arises from an abnormal part of the [[eyelid]]. This abnormality, attributed to a [[genetic mutation]], is known to affect dogs and humans. Distichiae usually exit from the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the eyelid margin. They are usually multiple, and sometimes more than one arises from a duct. They can affect either the upper or lower eyelid and are usually bilateral. The lower eyelids of dogs usually have no eyelashes.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brooks | first = Dennis E. | title = Ophthalmic Examination Made Ridiculously Simple | work = Proceedings of the 30th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2005 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2005&PID=10923&O=Generic | access-date = 2007-02-20 }}</ref>

Distichiae usually cause no symptoms, because the lashes are soft, but they can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]]s and scarring.<ref>{{cite web | title = Eyelids: Conformational Abnormalities | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/30105.htm | access-date = 2007-02-20 }}</ref> Treatment options include manual removal, [[electrology|electrolysis]], [[cauterization|electrocautery]], [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO<sub>2</sub> laser]] ablation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aesculight.com/case-studies/distichia-laser-surgery/|title=There's something in his eye: CO<sub>2</sub> surgical lasers for distichia|last=Winkler|first=Christopher|date=2020-01-06|website=Aesculight|language=en-US|orig-year=2019|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> [[cryosurgery|cryotherapy]], and [[surgery]].

==Commonly affected breeds==
In [[veterinary medicine]], some canine breeds are affected by distichiasis more frequently than others:
*[[Cocker Spaniel]]
*[[Dachshund]] (especially the miniature longhaired Dachshund)
*[[Bulldog]]
*[[Pekingese]]
*[[Yorkshire Terrier]]
*[[Flat-Coated Retriever]]
*[[Shetland Sheepdog]]
*[[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]]
*[[Poodle]]<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|editor=Gelatt, Kirk N.|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref>

==Ectopic cilia==
An ectopic cilia is a special type of distichia usually found in younger dogs. Commonly affected breeds include Poodles, [[Golden Retriever]]s, and [[Shih Tzu]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ketring | first = Kerry I. | title = The Top Ten Ophthalmic Mistakes | work = Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/308.pdf?LA=1 | format = PDF | access-date = 2007-02-20 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094306/http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/308.pdf?LA=1 | archive-date = 2007-09-29 }}</ref> The eyelash exits through the [[conjunctiva]] of the eyelid facing toward the eye, usually at the middle of the upper eyelid. It can cause intense pain and [[corneal ulcer]]s. Treatment is surgery or cryotherapy.
