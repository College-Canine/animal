The '''estrous cycle''' ({{etymology|la|{{wiktlat|oestrus}}|frenzy}}, originally {{etymology|grc|''{{wiktgrc|οἶστρος}}'' ({{grc-transl|οἶστρος}})|gadfly}}) is a set of recurring physiological changes induced by [[reproductive hormone]]s in [[female]]s of [[mammal]]ian subclass [[Theria]].<ref>Hill, M.

Retrieved from https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Estrous_Cycle</ref> Estrous cycles start after [[sexual maturity]] in females and are interrupted by anestrous phases, otherwise known as "rest" phases, or by [[Pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancies]].

==Differences from the menstrual cycle==
{{Further|Menstrual cycle#Cycles and phases}}

Mammals share the same reproductive system, including the regulatory [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] system that produces [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] in pulses, the [[pituitary gland]] that secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[luteinizing hormone]], and the ovary itself that releases [[sex hormone]]s, including [[estrogen]]s and [[progesterone]].

However, that animals that have estrous cycles [[Resorption|resorb]] the [[endometrium]] if conception does not occur during that cycle. Mammals that have menstrual cycles shed the endometrium through [[Menstruation (mammal)|menstruation]] instead.

Humans, [[elephant shrew]]s, and a few other species have [[menstrual cycle]]s rather than estrous cycles. Humans, unlike most other species, have [[concealed ovulation]], a lack of obvious external signs to signal estral receptivity at [[ovulation]] (i.e., the ability to become pregnant). Some species of animals with estrous cycles have unmistakable outward displays of receptivity, ranging from engorged and colorful [[genitals]] to behavioral changes like [[mating call]]s.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
''Estrus'' is derived via Latin ''{{lang|la|oestrus}}'' ('[[Rage (emotion)|frenzy]]', '[[Botfly|gadfly]]'), from Greek {{lang|grc|οἶστρος}} ''oîstros'' (literally 'gadfly', more figuratively 'frenzy', 'madness', among other meanings like 'breeze'). Specifically, this refers to the gadfly in [[Ancient Greek mythology]] that [[Hera]] sent to torment [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who had been won in her [[Cow|heifer]] form by [[Zeus]].{{fact|date=October 2021}} [[Euripides]] used ''oestrus'' to indicate 'frenzy', and to describe madness. [[Homer]] used the word to describe panic.<ref>Panic of the [[suitor]]s in Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'', book 22</ref> [[Plato]] also used it to refer to an irrational drive<ref>Plato, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', 854b</ref> and to describe the [[soul]] "driven and drawn by the gadfly of desire".<ref>Plato, ''The Republic''</ref> Somewhat more closely aligned to current meaning and usage of ''estrus'', [[Herodotus]] (''Histories'', ch. 93.1) uses ''oîstros'' to describe the desire of fish to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].<ref>Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', ch. 93.1</ref>

The earliest use in English was with a meaning of 'frenzied passion'. In 1900, it was first used to describe '[[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] in animals; heat'.<ref name= Freeman_1994/><ref>{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Heape |title=The 'sexual season' of mammals and the relation of the 'pro-oestrum' to menstruation'|journal=Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science |date=1900 |volume=44 |pages=1:70}}</ref>

In [[British English]], the spelling is ''oestrus'' or (rarely) ''œstrus''. In all English spellings, the noun ends in ''-us'' and the adjective in ''-ous''. Thus in [[North American English|Modern International English]], a mammal may be described as "in estrus" when it is in that particular [[#Four phases|part of the estrous-cycle]].

==Four phases==
{{Redirect|Estrus}}
[[Image:Estrous cycle.png|top|Overview of the mammalian estrous cycle]]

A four-phase terminology is used in reference to animals with estrous cycles.

===Proestrus===
One or several [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]]s of the [[ovary]] start to grow. Their number is species-specific. Typically, this phase can last as little as one day or as long as three weeks, depending on the species. Under the influence of estrogen, the lining of the uterus ([[endometrium]]) starts to develop. Some animals may experience vaginal secretions that could be bloody. The female is not yet sexually receptive; the old [[corpus luteum]] degenerates; the uterus and the vagina distend and fill with fluid, become contractile and secrete a sanguinous fluid; the [[vaginal epithelium]] proliferates and the vaginal cytology shows a large number of non-cornified nucleated epithelial cells. Variant terms for ''proestrus'' include ''pro-oestrus'', ''proestrum'', and ''pro-oestrum''.

===Estrus===
'''Estrus''' or '''oestrus''' refers to the phase when the female is sexually receptive ("'''in heat'''" in American English, or "'''on heat'''" in British English). Under regulation by [[Gonadotropin|gonadotropic hormone]]s, [[ovarian follicle]]s mature and estrogen secretions exert their biggest influence. The female then exhibits sexually receptive behavior,<ref name="Miller et al.">{{cite journal|first=Geoffrey|last=Miller|date=April 2007|title=Ovulatory cycle effects on tip earnings by lap dancers: Economic evidence for human estrus?|url=http://www.unm.edu/%7Egfmiller/cycle_effects_on_tips.pdf|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=28 |issue=6|pages=375–381|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.06.002}}</ref> a situation that may be signaled by visible physiologic changes. Estrus is commonly seen in the mammalian species, including some primates.

In some species, the [[vulva]] becomes swollen and reddened.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Weir |first=Malcolm |title=Estrus and Mating in Dogs |url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/breeding-for-pet-owners-estrus-and-mating-in-dogs |website=VCA Animal Hospital}}</ref> [[Ovulation]] may occur spontaneously in others.  Especially among [[quadrupeds]], a signal trait of estrus is the [[Lordosis behavior|lordosis reflex]], in which the animal spontaneously elevates her hindquarters.

[[Controlled internal drug release]] devices are used in [[livestock]] for the synchronization of estrus.

===Metestrus or diestrus===
This phase is characterized by the activity of the [[corpus luteum]], which produces progesterone. The signs of estrogen stimulation subside and the [[corpus luteum]] starts to form. The [[uterus|uterine]] lining begins to appear. In the absence of [[Pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]], the diestrus phase (also termed [[pseudopregnancy]]) terminates with the [[Regression (medicine)|regression]] of the corpus luteum. The lining in the uterus is not shed, but is reorganized for the next cycle.  Other spellings include ''metoestrus'', ''metestrum'', ''metoestrum'', ''dioestrus'', ''diestrum'', and ''dioestrum''.

===Anestrus===
Anestrus refers to the phase when the sexual cycle rests. This is typically a seasonal event and controlled by light exposure through the [[pineal gland]] that releases [[melatonin]]. Melatonin may repress stimulation of reproduction in long-day breeders and stimulate reproduction in short-day breeders. Melatonin is thought to act by regulating the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] pulse activity of the [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]]. Anestrus is induced by time of year, [[Pregnancy (mammals)|pregnancy]], [[lactation]], significant [[illness]], chronic energy deficit, and possibly age. Chronic exposure to anabolic steroids may also induce a persistent anestrus due to negative feedback on the hypothalamus/pituitary/gonadal axis. Other spellings include ''anoestrus'', ''anestrum'', and ''anoestrum''.

{{anchor|postpartum estrus}}
After completion (or abortion) of a pregnancy, some species have ''postpartum estrus'', which is ovulation and corpus luteum production that occurs immediately following the birth of the young.<ref>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=30535 medilexicon.com > postpartum estrus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031712/http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=30535 |date=2016-03-04 }} citing: Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Copyright 2006</ref> For example, the [[mouse]] has a fertile postpartum estrus that occurs 14 to 24 hours following parturition.

==Cycle-variability==
Estrous cycle variability differs among species, but cycles are typically more frequent in smaller animals. Even within species significant variability can be observed, thus [[cat]]s may undergo an estrous cycle of 3 to 7 weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Brenda|date=December 2001|title=Prolific Cats: The Oestrous Cycle|url=http://assets.prod.vetlearn.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mmah/c8/4524e5b2f84140bc3aa42fdf307687/filePV_23_12_1049.pdf|journal=Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian|volume=23|issue=12|pages=1049–1056|via=}}</ref> Domestication can affect estrous cycles due to changes in the environment. For most species, vaginal smear [[Cell biology|cytology]] may be used in order to identify estrous cycle phases and durations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Marcondes|first1=F. K.|last2=Bianchi|first2=F.

==Frequency==
Some species, such as [[cat]]s, [[cow]]s and [[domestic pig]]s, are '''polyestrous''', meaning that they can go into heat several times per year. Seasonally polyestrous animals or [[seasonal breeder]]s have more than one estrous cycle during a specific time of the year and can be divided into short-day and long-day breeders:
* Short-day breeders, such as [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[deer]] and [[Red Deer|elk]] are sexually active in fall or winter.
* Long-day breeders, such as [[horse]]s, [[hamster]]s and [[ferret]]s are sexually active in spring and summer.

Species that go into heat twice per year are '''diestrous'''. Canines are diestrous.

'''Monestrous''' species, such as [[Canidae|canids]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Valdespino, C. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Asa, C.S. |author3=Bauman, J.E. |year=2002 |title=Estrous cycles, copulation and pregnancy in the fennec fox (''Vulpes zerda'') |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=99–109 |doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2002)083<0099:ECCAPI>2.0.CO;2 |s2cid=51812228 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-pdf/83/1/99/7022997/83-1-99.pdf}}</ref> and [[bear]]s, have only one [[breeding season]] per year, typically in spring to allow growth of the [[offspring]] during the warm season to aid survival during the next winter.

A few mammalian species, such as [[rabbit]]s, do not have an estrous cycle, instead being [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced to ovulate]] by the act of mating and are able to conceive at almost any arbitrary moment.

Generally speaking, the timing of estrus is coordinated with seasonal availability of food and other circumstances such as migration, predation etc., the goal being to maximize the offspring's chances of survival. Some species are able to modify their estral timing in response to external conditions.

==Specific species==

===Cats===
The female [[cat]] in heat has an estrus of 14 to 21 days and is generally characterized as an [[induced ovulator]], since coitus induces ovulation. However, various incidents of spontaneous ovulation have been documented in the domestic cat and various non-domestic species.<ref>Pelican ''et al.'', 2006</ref> Without ovulation, she may enter interestrus, which is the combined stages of diestrus and anestrus, before reentering estrus. With the induction of ovulation, the female becomes pregnant or undergoes a non-pregnant [[luteal phase]], also known as [[pseudopregnancy]]. Cats are polyestrous but experience a seasonal anestrus in autumn and late winter.<ref>Spindler and Wildt, 1999</ref>

=== Dogs ===
{{Main|Canine reproduction}}

A female [[dog]] is usually diestrous (goes into heat typically twice per year), although some breeds typically have one or three cycles per year. The proestrus is relatively long at 5 to 9 days, while the estrus may last 4 to 13 days, with a diestrus of 60 days followed by about 90 to 150 days of anestrus. Female dogs bleed during estrus, which usually lasts from 7–13 days, depending on the size and maturity of the dog. Ovulation occurs 24–48 hours after the luteinizing hormone peak, which occurs around the fourth day of estrus; therefore, this is the best time to begin breeding. Proestrus bleeding in dogs is common and is believed to be caused by [[Leukocyte extravasation|diapedesis]] of [[red blood cell]]s from the blood vessels due to the increase of the [[Estradiol|estradiol-17β hormone]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=I. |last2= Galabova |first2=G. |last3=Dimov |first3=D. |last4= Helmreich |first4=M. |title= The morphological basis of proestrus endometrial bleeding in canines |journal= Theriogenology |date= February 2011 |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages= 411–420 |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.04.022|pmid=21112080 }}</ref>

===Horses===
{{Main|Horse reproduction}}

A [[mare (horse)|mare]] may be in heat for 4 to 10 days, followed by approximately 14 days in diestrus. Thus, a cycle may be short, totaling approximately 3 weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aurich|first=Christine|date=2011-04-01|title=Reproductive cycles of horses|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432011000340|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|series=Special Issue: Reproductive Cycles of Animals|language=en|volume=124|issue=3|pages=220–228|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2011.02.005|pmid=21377299|issn=0378-4320}}</ref> Horses mate in spring and summer; autumn is a transition time, and anestrus occurs during winter.

A feature of the [[fertility]] cycle of horses and other large herd animals is that it is usually affected by the seasons. The number of hours daily that light enters the eye of the animal affects the brain, which governs the release of certain precursors and hormones. When daylight hours are few, these animals "shut down", become anestrous, and do not become fertile. As the days grow longer, the longer periods of daylight cause the hormones that activate the breeding cycle to be released. As it happens, this benefits these animals in that, given a gestation period of about eleven months, it prevents them from having young when the cold of winter would make their survival risky.

===Rats===
Rats are polyestrous animals that typically have rapid cycle lengths of 4 to 5 days.<ref>Hill, M.A. (2021, March 11) Embryology ''Estrous Cycle''. Retrieved from https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Estrous_Cycle</ref> Although they ovulate spontaneously, they do not develop a fully functioning corpus luteum unless they receive coital stimulation. Fertile mating leads to pregnancy in this way, but infertile mating leads to a state of pseudopregnancy lasting about 10 days. Mice and hamsters have similar behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCracken |first1=J. A. |last2=Custer |first2=E. E. |last3=Lamsa |first3=J.

D. |editor2-last=Neill }}</ref>

A set of follicles starts to develop near the end of proestrus and grows at a nearly constant rate until the beginning of the subsequent estrus when the growth rates accelerate eightfold. Ovulation occurs about 109 hours after the start of follicle growth.

[[Estrogen]] peaks at about 11 am on the day of proestrus. Between then and midnight there is a surge in [[progesterone]], [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], and ovulation occurs at about 4 am on the next estrus day. The following day, metestrus, is called early diestrus or diestrus I. During this day, the [[corpus luteum|corpora lutea]] grow to a maximal volume, achieved within 24 hours of ovulation. They remain at that size for three days, halve in size before the metestrus of the next cycle and then shrink abruptly before estrus of the cycle after that. Thus the ovaries of cycling rats contain three different sets of corpora lutea at different phases of development.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yoshinaga |first=K. |chapter=Gonadotrophin-induced hormone secretion and structural changes in the ovary during the nonpregnant reproductive cycle |title=Handbook of Physiology |volume=Endocrinology II, Part 1 |date=1973}}</ref>

===Bison===

Buffalo have an estrous cycle of about 22 to 24 days. Buffalo are known for difficult estrus detection. This is one major reason for being less productive than [[cattle]]. During four phases of its estrous cycle, mean weight of [[corpus luteum]] has been found to be 1.23±0.22g (metestrus), 3.15±0.10g (early diestrus), 2.25±0.32g (late diestrus), and 1.89±0.31g (proestrus/estrus), respectively. The plasma progesterone concentration was 1.68±0.37, 4.29±0.22, 3.89±0.33, and 0.34±0.14&nbsp;ng/ml while mean vascular density (mean number of vessels/10 microscopic fields at 400x) in corpus luteum was 6.33±0.99, 18.00±0.86, 11.50±0.76, and 2.83±0.60 during the metestrus, early diestrus, late diestrus and proestrus/estrus, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Qureshi |first1=A.

===Cattle===
Female cattle, also referred to as "[[heifer (cow)|heifer]]s" in agriculture, will gradually enter standing estrus, or "standing heat," starting at puberty between 9 and 15 months of age. The cow estrous cycle typically lasts 21 days.<ref name=":12"/> Standing estrus is a visual cue which signifies sexual receptivity for [[Copulation (zoology)|mounting]] by male cattle.

====Estrous control====
{{Further|Estrous synchronization}}

Due to the widespread use of bovine animals in agriculture, cattle estrous cycles have been widely studied, and manipulated, in an effort to maximize profitability through reproductive management.<ref name=":0" /> Much estrous control in cattle is for the purpose of synchronization, a practice or set of practices most often used by cattle farmers to control the timing and duration of estrus in large herds.<ref name=":22"/>

There is variation between the available methods of cattle estrous synchronization. Treatment depends on herd size, specific goals for control, and budget.<ref name=":22"/> Some of the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved drugs and devices used to mimic natural hormones of the estrous cycle include, but are not limited to, the following classes:

* [[Gonadorelin]]: There are currently five available gonadorelin products that are FDA-Approved.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Center for Veterinary|date=2018-11-03|title=Fertagyl® (gonadorelin acetate) - Veterinarians|url=https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fertagylr-gonadorelin-acetate-veterinarians|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref> Usually, gonadorelin is used in conjunction with another estrous control drug (typically, prostaglandin).<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=LUTALYSE® Injection (dinoprost injection)|url=https://www.zoetisus.com/products/dairy/lutalyse_injection.aspx|access-date=2021-04-06|website=www.zoetisus.com|language=en}}</ref> This drug is used to mimic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and may also be used to treat ovarian cysts.<ref name=":12"/>
* [[Prostaglandin]]: Mimics the prostaglandin F2-alpha hormone released when no pregnancy has occurred and regresses the corpus luteum.<ref name=":12"/> This drug is used to achieve more consistent results in artificial insemination.<ref name=":5" />
