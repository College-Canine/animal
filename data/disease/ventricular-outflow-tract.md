A '''ventricular outflow tract''' is a portion of either the [[left ventricle]]  or [[right ventricle]] of the [[heart]] through which [[blood]] passes in order to enter the [[great arteries]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Tucker |first1=William D. |title=Anatomy, Thorax, Heart Pulmonary Arteries |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534812/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-10-22 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30521233 |last2=Weber |first2=Carly |last3=Burns |first3=Bracken}}</ref>

The right ventricular outflow tract ('''RVOT''') is an [[Conus arteriosus|infundibular]] extension of the ventricular cavity that connects to the [[pulmonary artery]]. The left ventricular outflow tract ('''LVOT'''), which connects to the [[aorta]], is nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the ventricle. The outflow tract is derived from the secondary heart field, during cardiogenesis.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Bassel-Duby |first1=R. |title=Biochemistry of Development: Striated Muscle |date=2013-01-01 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123786302000918 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry (Second Edition) |pages=179â€“186 |editor-last=Lennarz |editor-first=William J. |access-date=2023-10-22 |place=Waltham |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378631-9 |last2=Olson |first2=E.

Both the left and right outflow tract have their own term. The right outflow tract is called "conus arteriosus" from the outside, and infundibulum from the inside. In the left ventricle the outflow tract is the "aortic vestibule". They both possess smooth walls, and are derived from the embryonic bulbus cordis<ref>Gray's anatomy for students, 2nd edition</ref>

In both left and right ventricle there are specific structures separating the inflow and outflow of blood. In the right ventricle, the inflow and outflow is separated by the supraventricular crest. In the left ventricle, the anterior cusp of the mitral valve is responsible for separating the flow of blood.<ref>Moore - Clinically oriented anatomy 7th edition</ref>

A form of [[ventricular tachycardia]] originating from this anatomical structure is called RVOT tachycardia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fuenmayor |first=Abdel J |date=2014-06-30 |title=Treatment Or Cure Of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Tachycardia |journal=Journal of Atrial Fibrillation |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1038 |doi=10.4022/jafib.1038 |doi-broken-date=31 January 2024 |issn=1941-6911 |pmc=5135148 |pmid=27957079}}</ref>

The RVOT is pathophysiologically affected in [[Brugada syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://en.ecgpedia.org/wiki/Brugada_Syndrome | title=Brugada Syndrome - ECGpedia }}</ref>
