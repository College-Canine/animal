'''Anemia''' or '''anaemia''' ([[British English]]) is a [[blood disorder]] in which the [[blood]] has a reduced ability to carry [[oxygen]]. This can be due to a lower than normal number of [[red blood cell]]s, a reduction in the amount of [[hemoglobin]] available for oxygen transport, or abnormalities in hemoglobin that impair its function.<ref name="EMed">{{cite web |title=Anemia: Practice Essentials, Pathophysiology, Etiology |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/198475-overview |access-date=8 February 2022 |date=9 November 2021}}</ref><ref name="nhlbi">{{cite web |title=Anemia {{!}} NHLBI, NIH |url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/anemia |website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov |access-date=8 February 2022}}</ref>

In severe anemia, there may be signs of a [[hyperdynamic circulation]]: [[tachycardia]] (a fast heart rate), [[bounding pulse]], [[Functional murmur|flow murmurs]], and [[cardiac]] [[ventricular hypertrophy]] (enlargement). There may be signs of [[heart failure]].
[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]], the consumption of non-food items such as ice, paper, wax, grass, hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency;<ref>{{cite web |title=Mental Health and Pica |url=https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-pica |access-date=2022-04-26 |website=WebMD |language=en}}</ref> although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of [[hemoglobin]].

The causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction (hemolytic anemia), blood loss and fluid overload ([[hypervolemia]]). Several of these may interplay to cause anemia. The most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn, most commonly by [[iron deficiency]].<ref name=nhlbi/>

===Impaired production===
* Disturbance of proliferation and differentiation of stem cells

** [[Aplastic anemia]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/> affects all kinds of [[blood cell]]s. [[Fanconi anemia]] is a hereditary disorder or defect featuring aplastic anemia and various other abnormalities.
** Anemia of [[kidney failure]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/> due to insufficient production of the [[hormone]] [[erythropoietin]]

* Disturbance of proliferation and maturation of [[erythroblast]]s
** [[Pernicious anemia]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/> is a form of [[megaloblastic anemia]] due to [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]] dependent on impaired absorption of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]. Lack of dietary B<sub>12</sub> causes non-pernicious megaloblastic anemia.
** Anemia of [[folic acid deficiency|folate deficiency]],<ref name=Robbins12-1/> as with vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, causes [[megaloblastic anemia]]
** [[Anemia of prematurity]], by diminished erythropoietin response to declining [[hematocrit]] levels, combined with blood loss from laboratory testing, generally occurs in premature infants at two to six weeks of age.
** [[Iron-deficiency anemia]], resulting in deficient heme synthesis<ref name=Robbins12-1/>
** [[Thalassemia]]s, causing deficient globin synthesis<ref name=Robbins12-1/>
** [[Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]]s, causing ineffective erythropoiesis
** Anemia of kidney failure<ref name=Robbins12-1/> (also causing stem cell dysfunction)
* Other mechanisms of impaired RBC production
** [[Myelophthisic anemia]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/> or [[myelophthisis]] is a severe type of anemia resulting from the replacement of bone marrow by other materials, such as malignant tumors, fibrosis, or granulomas.
** [[Myelodysplastic syndrome]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/>
** anemia of [[chronic inflammation]]<ref name=Robbins12-1/>
** Leukoerythroblastic anemia is caused by space-occupying lesions in the [[bone marrow]] that prevent normal production of blood cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/leukoerythroblastosis|title=the definition of leukoerythroblastosis|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02|archive-date=2 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202070610/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/leukoerythroblastosis|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Increased destruction===

The roots of the words ''anemia'' and ''ischemia'' both refer to the basic idea of "lack of blood", but anemia and [[ischemia]] are not the same thing in modern medical terminology. The word ''anemia'' used alone implies [[Systemic effect|widespread]] ''effects'' from blood that either is too scarce (e.g., blood loss) or is dysfunctional in its oxygen-supplying ability (due to whatever type of hemoglobin or erythrocyte problem). In contrast, the word ''ischemia'' refers solely to the lack of blood (poor [[perfusion]]). Thus ischemia in a body part can cause localized anemic effects within those tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bellotto |first1=Fabio |last2=Cati |first2=Arianna |date=March 2006 |title=[Anemia and myocardial ischemia: relationships and interferences] |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16700423/ |journal=Recenti Progressi in Medicina |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=153–164 |issn=0034-1193 |pmid=16700423}}</ref>

The anemia is also classified by severity into mild (110 g/L to normal), moderate (80 g/L to 110 g/L), and severe anemia (less than 80 g/L) in adults.<ref name=WHODefSeverity>{{cite book |title=Haemoglobin concentrations for the diagnosis of anaemia and assessment of severity |date=2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |hdl=10665/85839 |hdl-access=free |last1=Organization |first1=World Health }}</ref> Different values are used in pregnancy and children.<ref name=WHODefSeverity/>

===Testing===
Anemia is typically diagnosed on a [[complete blood count]]. Apart from reporting the number of [[red blood cell]]s and the [[hemoglobin]] level, the [[Automated analyser|automatic counters]] also measure the size of the red blood cells by [[flow cytometry]], which is an important tool in distinguishing between the causes of anemia. Examination of a stained [[blood smear]] using a [[microscope]] can also be helpful, and it is sometimes a necessity in regions of the world where automated analysis is less accessible.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

A blood test will provide counts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. If anemia appears, further tests may determine what type it is, and whether it has a serious cause. although of that, it is possible to refer to the genetic history and physical diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anemia|url=https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/anemia|access-date=2021-10-11|website=Radiologyinfo.org|language=en}}</ref> These tests may also include [[Ferritin|serum ferritin]], [[Serum iron|iron studies]], [[Serum vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], genetic testing, and a [[Bone marrow examination|bone marrow sample]], if needed.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=How Anemia Is Diagnosed and Treated |url=https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-treatment |access-date=2021-10-11 |website=WebMD |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web |title=Anemia Types, Treatment, Symptoms, Signs, Causes & Iron Deficiency |url=https://www.emedicinehealth.com/anemia/article_em.htm |access-date=2021-10-11 |website=eMedicineHealth |language=en}}</ref>

Reticulocyte counts, and the "kinetic" approach to anemia, have become more common than in the past in the large medical centers of the United States and some other wealthy nations, in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts. A [[reticulocyte]] count is a quantitative measure of the [[bone marrow]]'s production of new red blood cells. The [[reticulocyte production index]] is a calculation of the ratio between the level of anemia and the extent to which the reticulocyte count has risen in response. If the degree of anemia is significant, even a "normal" reticulocyte count actually may reflect an inadequate response.
If an automated count is not available, a reticulocyte count can be done manually following special staining of the blood film. In manual examination, activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young RBCs by examination under a microscope. Newly formed RBCs are usually slightly larger than older RBCs and show polychromasia. Even where the source of blood loss is obvious, evaluation of [[erythropoiesis]] can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss and at what rate.
When the cause is not obvious, clinicians use other tests, such as: [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], [[serum iron]], [[transferrin]], [[folate|RBC folate level]], [[hemoglobin electrophoresis]], [[renal function]] tests (e.g. [[serum creatinine]]) although the tests will depend on the clinical hypothesis that is being investigated.
When the diagnosis remains difficult, a [[bone marrow examination]] allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells, although is rarely used as is painful, invasive and is hence reserved for cases where severe pathology needs to be determined or excluded.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Red blood cell size===
In the morphological approach, anemia is classified by the size of red blood cells; this is either done automatically or on microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear. The size is reflected in the [[mean corpuscular volume]] (MCV). If the cells are smaller than normal (under 80 [[femtolitre|fl]]), the anemia is said to be [[microcytic anemia|microcytic]]; if they are normal size (80–100 fl), normocytic; and if they are larger than normal (over 100 fl), the anemia is classified as [[macrocytic anemia|macrocytic]]. This scheme quickly exposes some of the most common causes of anemia; for instance, a microcytic anemia is often the result of [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]]. In clinical workup, the MCV will be one of the first pieces of information available, so even among clinicians who consider the "kinetic" approach more useful philosophically, morphology will remain an important element of classification and diagnosis.
Limitations of MCV include cases where the underlying cause is due to a combination of factors – such as iron deficiency (a cause of microcytosis) and vitamin [[B12 deficiency]] (a cause of macrocytosis) where the net result can be normocytic cells.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Production vs. destruction or loss===
The "kinetic" approach to anemia yields arguably the most clinically relevant classification of anemia. This classification depends on evaluation of several hematological parameters, particularly the blood [[reticulocyte]] (precursor of mature RBCs) count. This then yields the classification of defects by decreased RBC production versus increased RBC destruction or loss. Clinical signs of loss or destruction include abnormal [[peripheral blood smear]] with signs of hemolysis; elevated [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] suggesting cell destruction; or clinical signs of bleeding, such as guaiac-positive stool, radiographic findings, or frank bleeding.{{medical citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia overall and it has many causes. RBCs often appear hypochromic (paler than usual) and microcytic (smaller than usual) when viewed with a microscope.
* Iron-deficiency anemia is due to insufficient dietary intake or absorption of [[iron]] to meet the body's needs. Infants, toddlers, and pregnant women have higher than average needs. Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues, frequent blood donations, or [[Menorrhagia|heavy menstrual periods]].<ref name=irond>[https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/nutrition/nutrition_for_everyone/iron_deficiency/index.htm Recommendations to Prevent and Control Iron Deficiency in the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420203221/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/nutrition/nutrition_for_everyone/iron_deficiency/index.htm |date=2007-04-20 }} MMWR 1998;47 (No. RR-3) p. 5</ref> Iron is an essential part of hemoglobin, and low iron levels result in decreased incorporation of hemoglobin into red blood cells.

[[Fecal occult blood|Fecal occult blood testing]], [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|upper endoscopy]] and [[colonoscopy|lower endoscopy]] should be performed to identify bleeding lesions. In older men and women, the chances are higher that bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract could be due to [[Polyp (medicine)|colon polyp]]s or [[colorectal cancer]].

====Macrocytic====
{{main|Macrocytic anemia}}
* [[Megaloblastic anemia]], the most common cause of macrocytic anemia, is due to a deficiency of either [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[folic acid]], or both.<ref>{{cite web |title=Macrocytic Anemia - an overview  |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/macrocytic-anemia |access-date=2022-04-26 |website=ScienceDirect Topics }}</ref> Deficiency in folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be due either to inadequate intake or [[malabsorption|insufficient absorption]]. Folate deficiency normally does not produce neurological symptoms, while B<sub>12</sub> deficiency does.
** [[Pernicious anemia]] is caused by a lack of [[intrinsic factor]], which is required to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from food. A lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an [[autoimmune]] condition targeting the [[parietal cell]]s (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself. These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.
** Macrocytic anemia can also be caused by the removal of the functional portion of the stomach, such as during [[gastric bypass]] surgery, leading to reduced vitamin B<sub>12</sub>/folate absorption. Therefore, one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure.
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Alcoholism]] commonly causes a [[macrocytosis]], although not specifically anemia. Other types of [[liver disease]] can also cause macrocytosis.
* Drugs such as [[methotrexate]], [[zidovudine]], and other substances may inhibit [[DNA replication]] such as [[heavy metals]]
Macrocytic anemia can be further divided into "megaloblastic anemia" or "nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e. unimpaired DNA globin synthesis,) which occur, for example, in alcoholism.
In addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency include [[peripheral neuropathy]] and [[subacute combined degeneration of the cord]] with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/NEURO/topic439.htm eMedicine – "Vitamin B-12 Associated Neurological Diseases": Article by Niranjan N Singh], July 18, 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315044706/http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic439.htm|date=2007-03-15}}.</ref> Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and [[glossitis]].
The treatment for vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-deficient anemia was first devised by [[William Murphy (scientist)|William Murphy]], who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease. [[George Richards Minot|George Minot]] and [[George Whipple]] then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] from the liver. All three shared the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/press.html |title=Physiology or Medicine 1934 – Presentation Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1934-12-10 |access-date=2010-08-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828134134/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/press.html| archive-date= 28 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>

====Normocytic====
{{main|Normocytic anemia}}
Normocytic anemia occurs when the overall hemoglobin levels are decreased, but the red blood cell size ([[mean corpuscular volume]]) remains normal. Causes include:
{{columns-list|
* Acute [[hemorrhage|blood loss]]
* [[Anemia of chronic disease]]
* [[Aplastic anemia]] (bone marrow failure)
* [[Hemolytic anemia]]
}}

====Dimorphic====
A dimorphic appearance on a peripheral blood smear occurs when there are two simultaneous populations of red blood cells, typically of different size and hemoglobin content (this last feature affecting the color of the red blood cell on a stained peripheral blood smear). For example, a person recently transfused for iron deficiency would have small, pale, iron deficient red blood cells (RBCs) and the donor RBCs of normal size and color. Similarly, a person transfused for severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency would have two cell populations, but, in this case, the patient's RBCs would be larger and paler than the donor's RBCs. A person with sideroblastic anemia (a defect in heme synthesis, commonly caused by alcoholism, but also drugs/toxins, nutritional deficiencies, a few acquired and rare congenital diseases) can have a dimorphic smear from the sideroblastic anemia alone. Evidence for multiple causes appears with an elevated RBC distribution width (RDW), indicating a wider-than-normal range of red cell sizes, also seen in common nutritional anemia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Heinz body anemia====
[[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]] form in the cytoplasm of RBCs and appear as small dark dots under the microscope. In animals, Heinz body anemia has many causes. It may be drug-induced, for example in cats and dogs by [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol),<ref name="Harvey 2012"/> or may be caused by eating various plants or other substances:
* In [[cat]]s and dogs after eating either raw or cooked plants from the genus ''[[Allium]]'', for example, [[onion]]s or garlic.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Hovda|editor1-first=L|editor2-last=Brutlag|editor2-first=A|editor3-last=Poppenga|editor3-first=RH|editor4-last=Peterson|editor4-first=K | title=Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology|date=2016|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-119-03652-4|pages=515–520|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 69: Onions and garlic}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The global market for anemia treatments is estimated at more than USD 23 billion per year and is fast growing because of the rising prevalence and awareness of anemia. The types of anemia treated with drugs are [[iron-deficiency anemia]], [[thalassemia]], [[aplastic anemia]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[sickle cell disease|sickle cell anemia]], and [[pernicious anemia]], the most important of them being deficiency and sickle cell anemia with together 60% of market share because of highest prevalence as well as higher treatment costs compared with other types.<ref name=2019MarketStudy/> Treatment for anemia depends on cause and severity. Vitamin supplements given orally ([[folic acid]] or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) or intramuscularly ([[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]) will replace specific deficiencies.<ref name=EBM2013 /> Apart from that iron supplements, antibiotics, immunosuppressant, bone marrow stimulants, corticosteroids, gene therapy and iron chelating agents are forms of anemia treatment drugs, with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids accounting for 58% of the market share. A paradigm shift towards gene therapy and monoclonal antibody therapies are observed.<ref name=2019MarketStudy/> 

===Oral iron===

Nutritional iron deficiency is common in developing nations. An estimated two-thirds of children and of women of childbearing age in most developing nations are estimated to have iron deficiency without anemia; one-third of them have iron deficiency with anemia.<ref name="pmid8901803">{{cite journal | vauthors = West CE | title = Strategies to control nutritional anemia | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 789–790 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8901803 | doi =  10.1093/ajcn/64.5.789| doi-access = free }}</ref> Iron deficiency due to inadequate dietary iron intake is rare in men and postmenopausal women. The diagnosis of iron deficiency mandates a search for potential sources of blood loss, such as gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or colon cancer.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]], [[ferrous fumarate]], or [[ferrous gluconate]]. Daily iron supplements have been shown to be effective in reducing anemia in women of childbearing age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Low |first1=MS |last2=Speedy |first2=J |last3=Styles |first3=CE |last4=De-Regil |first4=LM |last5=Pasricha |first5=SR |title=Daily iron supplementation for improving anaemia, iron status and health in menstruating women. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=18 April 2016 |volume=2016 |issue=4 |pages=CD009747 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2 |pmid=27087396|pmc=10182438 }}</ref> When taking iron supplements, stomach upset or darkening of the feces are commonly experienced. The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed.

In the anemia of chronic kidney disease, [[recombinant protein|recombinant]] [[erythropoietin]] or [[epoetin alfa]] is recommended to stimulate RBC production, and if iron deficiency and inflammation are also present, concurrent [[parenteral iron]] is also recommended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG114/Guidance/pdf/English |title=Anaemia management in people with chronic kidney disease &#124; Guidance and guidelines &#124; NICE |date=9 February 2011 |access-date=2013-08-09 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624124919/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG114/Guidance/pdf/English |archive-date=2013-06-24  }}</ref>

===Injectable iron===
In cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective, would be too slow (for example, pre-operatively), or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation), [[parenteral iron]] preparations can be used. Parenteral iron can improve iron stores rapidly and is also effective for treating people with postpartum haemorrhage, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic heart failure.<ref name="Ng Keeler Mishra et al 2019">{{cite journal |last1=Ng |first1=Oliver |last2=Keeler |first2=Barrie D |last3=Mishra |first3=Amitabh |last4=Simpson |first4=J A |last5=Neal |first5=Keith |last6=Al-Hassi |first6=Hafid Omar |last7=Brookes |first7=Matthew J |last8=Acheson |first8=Austin G |date=7 December 2019 |title=Iron therapy for preoperative anaemia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2019 |issue=12 |pages=CD011588 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011588.pub3 |pmc=6899074 |pmid=31811820}}</ref> The body can absorb up to 6&nbsp;mg iron daily from the gastrointestinal tract.

A 2012 review concluded that when considering blood transfusions for anaemia in people with advanced cancer who have fatigue and breathlessness (not related to cancer treatment or haemorrhage), consideration should be given to whether there are alternative strategies can be tried before a blood transfusion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Preston |first1=Nancy J |last2=Hurlow |first2=Adam |last3=Brine |first3=Jennifer |last4=Bennett |first4=Michael I |title=Blood transfusions for anaemia in patients with advanced cancer |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=15 February 2012 |volume=2012 |issue=2 |pages=CD009007 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009007.pub2 |pmid=22336857 |pmc=7388847 }}</ref>

=== Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> intramuscular injections ===
In many cases, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is used by [[intramuscular injection]] in severe cases or cases of malabsorption of dietary-B<sub>12</sub>. [[Pernicious anemia]] caused by loss of [[intrinsic factor]] cannot be prevented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pernicious anemia: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000569.htm |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=medlineplus.gov |language=en}}</ref> If there are other, reversible causes of low vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels, the cause must be treated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hankey |first=Graeme J. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/503441695 |title=Clinical neurology |date=2008 |publisher=Manson |others=Joanna M.

===Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents===
The objective for the administration of an [[erythropoiesis-stimulating agent]] (ESA) is to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and meets the individual person's needs.<ref name="2007anemiaESA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aapro MS, Link H | title = September 2007 update on EORTC guidelines and anemia management with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 13 Suppl 3 | issue = Supplement 3 | pages = 33–36 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18458123 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.13-S3-33 }}</ref> They should not be used for mild or moderate anemia.<ref name=Kan2013/> They are not recommended in people with [[chronic kidney disease]] unless hemoglobin levels are less than 10 g/dL or they have symptoms of anemia.
