The '''Kerry Blue Terrier''' (also known as the '''Irish Blue Terrier''') ({{lang-gle|An Brocaire Gorm}}) is a [[dog breed|breed]] of dog.<ref name=purina>{{cite web | last=Purina Australia | title=Kerry Blue Terrier | work=Dog Breeds | access-date=2014-12-06 | url=http://www.purina.com.au/owning-a-dog/dog-breeds/Kerry-Blue-Terrier}}</ref> Originally bred to control [[vermin]] including rats, rabbits, badgers, ferrets, foxes, otters, hares, deer, and even wolves, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep. Despite a Kerry Blue winning [[Crufts]] (the most prestigious UK dog show) in 2000,<ref>{{cite web | title=Crufts 2000 Results| access-date=2024-01-20| url=https://www.fossedata.co.uk/show-results/crufts/Archive/default.aspx?Year=2000| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120052545/https://www.fossedata.co.uk/show-results/crufts/Archive/default.aspx?Year=2000| archive-date=20 January 2024}}</ref> it remains an "unfashionable" [[breed]],<ref>{{cite web | last=Reilly | first=Jerome | title=Collins's beloved Kerry Blue breed at risk in the UK | work=Independent.ie | access-date=2014-12-06 | date=2012-01-29 | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/collinss-beloved-kerry-blue-breed-at-risk-in-the-uk-26815879.html}}</ref> and is distinctly uncommon; however, it is not as threatened as some of the other [[terrier]] [[breeds]] such as the [[Skye Terrier]], [[Sealyham Terrier]], and [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]].

==Description==

===Appearance===
[[File:Kerry Blue Terrier 1916.jpg|Philip Doyle with his dog, "Terri", at the Killarney Show, 1916.|thumb]]
Some characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier include a long head, flat skull, deep chest, and a soft wavy-to-curly coat that comes in several shades of "blue", the general term outside this breed being [[Dog coat#Colors|progressive grey]]. Puppies are born black; the blue appears gradually as the puppy grows older, usually up to 2 years of age. The male Kerry Blue is usually {{convert|46|–|48|cm|abbr=on}} tall at the [[withers]] and weighs {{convert|12|–|15|kg|abbr=on}}, while the female is usually {{convert|44|–|46|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|–|13|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=purina />

===Coat===
The coat is the key feature of the Kerry. It is soft and wavy with no undercoat. The texture feels like a combination of fine human hair and wool.  It does not shed but continues to grow throughout the year. This means the Kerry Blue requires very regular grooming (at least once per week) and clipping an average of every 6 weeks.<ref name=AKC />

===Temperament===
Kerry Blue Terriers are strong-minded and highly spirited. They have always been loyal and affectionate towards their owners and very gentle towards children but were often considered hostile toward other animals, including other dogs.{{cn|date=February 2024}} If they are socialised with other dogs this is no longer the case.{{cn|date=February 2024}} In the early days of competitive dog showing, the [[Irish Kennel Club]] required Kerries had to pass a "[[gameness]]" test, known as [[Teastas Mor]] certification, before they were deemed worthy of being judged.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLennan|first1=Bardi|title=Kerry Blue Terrier|date=Jun 26, 2012|publisher=i5 Publishing}}</ref> These tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay in its set.  They are fast, strong, and intelligent, and they do well in [[Obedience training|obedience]], [[dog agility]], sheep herding, and tracking. They have been used as police dogs in Ireland. Modern breeders have attempted to retain high spirits whilst breeding out aggression.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

==History==
The first literary reference to probably the Kerry Blue dates to 1847, when the author describes a dog that is bluish slate in colour, marked with darker blotches and patches, and often with black about the legs and muzzle.<ref>[http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/003g03-en.pdf FCI Breed Standard]</ref> The Kerry Blue Terrier was first observed in the mountains of [[County Kerry|Kerry]] in Ireland, hence the name of the breed.<ref name=AKC>{{cite web|title=Kerry Blue Terrier - AKC Dog Breeds|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/kerry-blue-terrier/|website=AKC.org|access-date=18 February 2015}}</ref>

There is a romantic story of a blue dog swimming ashore from a shipwreck: the coat of this dog was so lovely that it was mated with all the female Wheaten Terriers in Kerry (or in all Ireland, according to some), producing the Kerry Blue. Perhaps this story is not entirely myth, as the [[Portuguese Water Dog]] is often suggested as part of the Kerry's makeup. Others suggest the Kerry was produced by the [[Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier]] crossed with the [[Bedlington Terrier]] with (or without) some [[Irish Wolfhound]] or [[Irish Terrier]] blood. The extinct Gadhar [[herding dog]] is also mentioned as another possible branch of the Kerry's family tree. The breed became very popular as an all-around farm dog in rural Ireland.{{citation needed|reason=source?|date=February 2021}}

=== National Dog of Ireland ===
With the development of dog shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed became standardised and "tidied up" for the show ring. The Irish nationalist leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] owned a famous Kerry Blue named Convict 224. Collins even made an attempt to have the Kerry Blue adopted as the national dog of Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborne |first=Chrissy|title=Michael Collins: Himself|publisher=Mercier Press Ltd|year=2003|pages=99–104|isbn=978-1-85635-407-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Tk--VVHsO8C&pg=PA98|access-date=12 October 2011}}</ref>

The first show of the Dublin Irish Blue Terrier Club took place outside official curfew hours and was entered both by those fighting for and against an Irish republic. The Dublin Irish Blue Terrier Club was so successful it led directly to the foundation of the [[Irish Kennel Club]], and a Kerry Blue was the first dog that club registered.{{citation needed|reason=source?|date=February 2021}}
