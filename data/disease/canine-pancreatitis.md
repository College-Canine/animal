'''Canine pancreatitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[pancreas]] that can occur in two very different forms. [[Acute pancreatitis]]<ref name="Washabau" /> is sudden, while [[chronic pancreatitis]] is characterized by recurring or persistent form of pancreatic inflammation. Cases of both can be considered mild or severe.<ref name="Steiner" />

==Background==
The pancreas is composed of two sections: the smaller [[Islets of Langerhans|endocrine]] portion, which is responsible for producing [[hormone]]s such as [[insulin]], [[somatostatin]], and [[glucagon]], and the larger, [[pancreas|exocrine]] portion,<ref name="Colorado exocrine" /> which produces [[enzyme]]s needed for the [[digestion]] of food. [[Acinus|Acinar cells]] make up 82% of the total pancreas; these cells are responsible for the production of the digestive enzymes.<ref name="ColState" /><ref name="Cell" />

==Pathophysiology==
Pancreatitis is caused by autodigestion of the pancreas thought to begin with an increase in secretion of pancreatic enzymes in response to a stimulus,<ref name="Colorado endocrine" /><ref name="CoPES" /> which can be any source from table scraps to getting into the garbage to drugs, toxins, and trauma.<ref name="Steiner" /><ref name="Tufts" /> The [[digestive enzyme]]s are released too quickly and begin acting on the pancreas instead of the food they normally digest.<ref name="Washabau" /><ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="UGA" /><ref name="Steiner 2003" /> Once the process cascades, inflammatory mediators and free radicals are released and pancreatitis develops, causing amplification of the process.<ref name="UGA" />

==Clinical signs==
The clinical signs can vary from mild gastrointestinal upset to death, with most dogs presenting with common gastrointestinal signs of upset, such as [[vomiting]], anorexia, painful abdomen, hunched posture, [[diarrhea]], fever, [[Diabetes in dogs#Dehydration|dehydration]], and lack of energy, with vomiting being the most common symptom.<ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="ArmstrongWestern2011" /><ref name="Merck" /> These signs are not specific just for pancreatitis and may be associated with other gastrointestinal diseases and conditions.<ref name="Steiner" /><ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="IDEXX" />

Acute pancreatitis can trigger a build-up of fluid, particularly in abdominal and thoracic (chest) areas, [[acute kidney injury]], and cause inflammation in arteries and veins.  The inflammation triggers the body's [[coagulation|clotting factors]], possibly depleting them to the point of spontaneous [[bleeding]].<ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="Brooks" /> This form can be fatal in animals and in humans.<ref name="Merck" />

Chronic pancreatitis can be present though no clinical signs of the disease are seen.<ref name="IDEXX" />

Pancreatitis can result in [[exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]], if the organ's acinar cells are permanently damaged; the pancreatic enzymes then need replacement with [[pancrelipase]] or similar products.  The damage can also extend into the endocrine portion of the pancreas, resulting in [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name="Hoskins" /> Whether the diabetes is [[Diabetes in dogs#When canine diabetes may not be permanent|transient (temporary)]] or permanent depends on the severity of the damage to the [[endocrine pancreas]] [[beta cell]]s.<ref name="Brooks" />

==Risk factors==
Although various causes of dog pancreatitis are known, such as drugs, fatty diet, trauma, etc., the pathophysiology is very complex.<ref name="Washabau" /><ref name="IDEXX" /> Pancreatitis can be [[idiopathic]]; no real causation factor can be found.<ref name="UGA" /><ref name="Merck" /> [[Dog health#Nutrition and obesity|Obese]] <!-- [[Dog health]]--> animals as well as animals fed a diet high in fat may be more prone to developing acute and chronic pancreatitis.<ref name="Washabau" /><ref name="ArmstrongWestern2011" /><ref name="Williams" /> Certain breeds of dogs are considered predisposed to developing pancreatitis including [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s, [[Cocker Spaniel]]s, and some [[terrier]] breeds.<ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="UGA" /><ref name="ArmstrongWestern2011" /><ref name="Simpson" /> Miniature Schnauzers as a breed tend toward developing [[hyperlipidemia]], an excess of circulating fats in the blood.<ref name="Xenoulis" /> The breed that appears to be at risk for the acute form of pancreatitis is the [[Yorkshire Terrier]], while [[Labrador Retriever]]s and [[Poodle|Miniature Poodles]] seem to have a decreased risk for the acute form of the disease.  Genetics may play a part in the risk factor.<ref name="Washabau" /> Dogs suffering from [[Diabetes in dogs|diabetes mellitus]], [[List of dog diseases#Endocrine diseases|Cushing's disease]] (hyperadrenocorticism), [[List of dog diseases#Endocrine diseases|hypothyroidism]], and [[List of dog diseases#Nervous system|epilepsy]] are at increased risk for pancreatitis.<ref name="Washabau" /><ref name="Brooks" /> Diabetes and hypothyroidism are also associated with hyperlipidemia.<ref name="Herrtage" /><ref name="ACVIM" /> Those with other types of gastrointestinal conditions and dogs that have had previous pancreatitis attacks are also at increased risk for the disorder.<ref name="Washabau" />

==Treatment==
No treatments for canine pancreatitis have been approved.  Treatment for this disease is supportive, and may require hospitalization to attend to the dog's nutritional and fluid needs, pain management, and addressing any other disease processes (infection, diabetes, etc.)<ref name="Hoskins" /> while letting the pancreas heal on its own.<ref name="Steiner" /><ref name="ArmstrongWestern2011" /> Treatment often involves "resting" the pancreas for a short period of time by which the patient receives no food or fluids by mouth, but is fed and hydrated by intravenous fluids and a feeding tube.<ref name="Tufts" /><ref name="Merck" /> [[Diabetes in dogs#Dehydration|Dehydration]] <!-- [[Diabetes in dogs]] --> is also managed by the use of fluid therapy.<ref name="treatment" /><ref name="Brooks" /><ref name="Hoskins" /> However, a specialist from [[Texas A&M University]] has stated, "There is no evidence whatsoever that withholding food has any beneficial effect." Other specialists have agreed with his opinion.<ref name="IDEXX" />

Canine pancreatitis is complex, often limiting the ability to approach the disease.

==Postpancreatitis management==
A low-fat diet is indicated.<ref name="Steiner" /> The use of drugs that are known to have an association with pancreatitis should be avoided.<ref name="IDEXX" /><ref name="Brooks" /> Some patients benefit from the use of pancreatic enzymes on a supplemental basis.  One study indicated that 57% dogs followed for six months after an acute pancreatitis attack, either continued to exhibit inflammation of the organ or had decreased acinar cell function, though they had no pancreatitis symptoms.<ref name="IDEXX" /><ref name="MerckChronic" />
