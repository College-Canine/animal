The '''temporal lobe''' is one of the four [[Lobes of the brain|major lobes]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] in the [[brain]] of [[mammal]]s. The temporal lobe is located beneath the [[lateral fissure]] on both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s of the mammalian brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/temporal.html|title=Temporal Lobe|work=Langbrain|publisher=Rice University|access-date=2 January 2011}}</ref>

The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of [[visual memory]], [[language comprehension]], and emotion association.<ref name=smith07>{{cite book|last1=Smith|last2=Kosslyn|title=Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain|year=2007|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|pages=21, 194–199, 349}}</ref>{{rp|21|date=December 2012}}
''Temporal'' refers to the head's [[Temple (anatomy)|temples]].

==Structure==

<!-- This paragraph would be better under "Function". -->The [[Temple (anatomy)#Etymology|temporal]] [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobe]] consists of structures that are vital for declarative or long-term memory. [[Declarative memory|Declarative]] (denotative) or [[Explicit memory|explicit]] memory is conscious memory divided into [[semantic memory]] (facts) and [[episodic memory]] (events).<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194|date=December 2012}} Medial temporal lobe structures that are critical for long-term memory include the [[hippocampus]], along with the surrounding [[Hippocampal formation|hippocampal region]] consisting of the [[Perirhinal cortex|perirhinal]], [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal]], and [[Entorhinal cortex|entorhinal]] neocortical regions.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|196|date=December 2012}} The hippocampus is critical for memory formation, and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|21|date=December 2012}} The [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|21|date=December 2012}}

<!-- Better under "Clinical Significance > Damage". -->Research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function, whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Squire|first1=LR|last2=Stark|first2=CE|last3=Clark|first3= RE|title=The medial temporal lobe|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|date=2004|volume=27|pages=279–306|pmid=15217334|url=http://whoville.ucsd.edu/PDFs/383_Squire_etal_%20AnnRevNeurosci2004.pdf|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144130}}</ref>

==Function==

===Visual memories===
The temporal lobe communicates with the [[hippocampus]] and plays a key role in the formation of explicit [[long-term memory]] modulated by the [[amygdala]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|349|date=December 2012}}

===Processing sensory input===
;Auditory: Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior, and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. The temporal lobe is involved in primary [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]] perception, such as hearing, and holds the [[primary auditory cortex]].<ref name=schacter10>{{cite book|first1=Daniel L.|last1= Schacter|first2= Daniel T.|last2= Gilbert|first3= Daniel M. |last3=Wegner|title=Psychology|url=https://archive.org/details/psychology0000scha|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429237192|edition=2nd}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> The primary auditory cortex receives sensory information from the ears and secondary areas process the information into meaningful units such as speech and words.<ref name="schacter10" />  The [[superior temporal gyrus]] includes an area (within the lateral fissure) where auditory signals from the [[cochlea]] first reach the [[cerebral cortex]] and are processed by the primary auditory cortex in the left temporal lobe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Language recognition===
The temporal lobe holds the [[primary auditory cortex]], which is important for the processing of [[semantics]] in both language and [[Visual perception|vision]] in humans. [[Wernicke's area]], which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with [[Broca's area]] in the [[frontal lobe]]) in language comprehension,<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Hickok|first1 = Gregory|last2 = Poeppel|first2 = David|date = May 2007|title = The Cortical Organization of Speech Processing|journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume = 8|pages = 393–402|doi = 10.1038/nrn2113|pmid=17431404|issue=5|s2cid = 6199399}}</ref> whether spoken language or [[American Sign Language|signed language]].

===New memories===
{{see also|Emotion and memory}}
The medial temporal lobes (near the [[sagittal plane]]) are thought to be involved in [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] [[Declarative memory|declarative]] [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194–199|date=December 2012}} The medial temporal lobes include the [[hippocampus|hippocampi]], which are essential for memory storage, therefore damage to this area can result in impairment in new memory formation leading to permanent or temporary [[anterograde amnesia]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194–199|date=December 2012}}

* [[Amnesia]], [[Korsakoff syndrome]], [[Klüver–Bucy syndrome]]

===Damage===
Individuals who suffer from medial temporal lobe damage have a difficult time recalling visual stimuli. This neurotransmission deficit is not due to lacking perception of visual stimuli, but rather to the inability to interpret what is perceived.<ref>Pertzov, Y., Miller, T. D., Gorgoraptis, N., Caine, D., Schott, J. M., Butler, C., & Husain, M. (2013). "Binding deficits in memory following medial temporal lobe damage in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody-associated limbic encephalitis". ''Brain: A Journal of Neurology'', 136(8), 2474–2485.</ref> The most common symptom of inferior temporal lobe damage is [[visual agnosia]], which involves impairment in the identification of familiar objects. Another less common type of inferior temporal lobe damage is [[prosopagnosia]] which is an impairment in the recognition of faces and distinction of unique individual facial features.<ref>Mizuno, T., & Takeda, K. (2009). "The symptomatology of frontal and temporal lobe damages". ''Brain And Nerve'' = ''Shinkei Kenkyū No Shinpo'', 61(11), 1209–1218.</ref>

[[Temporal lobe epilepsy]] is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures; symptoms include a variety of sensory (visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustation) hallucinations, as well as an inability to process semantic and episodic memories.<ref>Lah, S., & Smith, M. (2013). "Semantic and Episodic Memory in Children With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Do They Relate to Literacy Skills?". ''Neuropsychology'' {{doi|10.1037/neu0000029}}</ref>

[[Schizophrenia]] is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by severe disorientation. Its most explicit symptom is the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations. The cause of such hallucinations has been attributed to deficits in the left temporal lobe, specifically within the primary auditory cortex.<ref name="ReferenceA">Hugdahl K, Løberg E-M, Nygård M. "Left Temporal Lobe Structural and Functional Abnormality Underlying Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia". ''Frontiers in Neuroscience''. 2009;3(1):34–45. {{doi|10.3389/neuro.01.001.2009}}.</ref> Decreased gray matter, among other cellular deficits, contribute to spontaneous neural activity that affects the primary auditory cortex as if it were experiencing acoustic auditory input. The misrepresentation of speech in the auditory cortex results in the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients.<ref>Ikuta T, DeRosse P, Argyelan M, et al.
