'''Tracheal collapse''' in dogs is a condition characterized by incomplete formation or weakening of the [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] rings of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] resulting in flattening of the trachea.  It can be [[congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired, and [[extrathoracic]] or intrathoracic (inside or outside the thoracic cavity).  Tracheal collapse is a dynamic condition.  Collapse of the cervical trachea or extrathoracic (in the neck) occurs during inspiration; collapse of the thoracic trachea or intrathoracic (in the chest) occurs during expiration.<ref>{{cite web | last = Fossum | first = Theresa W. | title = Surgical Management Of Tracheal Collapse | work = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2695 | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>  Tracheal collapse is most commonly found in small [[dog]] breeds, including the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]], [[Poodle|Toy Poodle]], [[Shih Tzu]], [[Lhasa Apso]], [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]], [[Pug]], and [[Yorkshire Terrier]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J. |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

Congenital tracheal collapse appears to be caused by a deficiency of normal components of tracheal ring cartilage like [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[glycoprotein]]s, [[calcium]], and [[chondroitin]].  Acquired tracheal collapse can be caused by [[Cushing's syndrome (veterinary)|Cushing's syndrome]], heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease and infection.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Payne | first = Justin D. |author2=Mehler, Stephen J. |author3=Weisse, Chick | title = Tracheal Collapse | journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–382 | publisher = Veterinary Learning Systems |date=May 2006 }}</ref>

Symptoms include a cough (often called a "goose honk cough" due to its sound), especially when the dog is excited.  This cough is usually [[paroxysm]]al in nature.  Other symptoms include exercise intolerance, respiratory distress, and gagging while eating or drinking.  Tracheal collapse is easily seen on a [[radiograph]] as a narrowing of the [[lumen (anatomy)|tracheal lumen]].  Treatment for mild to moderate cases include [[corticosteroid]]s, [[bronchodilator]]s, and [[cough medicine|antitussive]]s.  Medical treatment is successful in about 70 percent of tracheal collapse cases.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ouellet M, Dunn M, Lussier B, Chailleux N, Hélie P |title=Noninvasive correction of a fractured endoluminal nitinol tracheal stent in a dog |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=467–71 |year=2006 |pmid=17088395}}</ref>  Severe cases can be treated with surgical implantation of a tracheal [[stent]] (inside or outside of the trachea) or prosthetic rings. Extraluminal (outside the trachea) stenting is generally used only for tracheal collapse in the neck region. Intraluminal stenting has shown more promise for success with intrathoracic cases, especially using nitinol, a type of [[shape memory alloy]] composed of [[nickel]] and [[titanium]].  Potential problems include stent migration and fracture.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Sammarco | first = Carl |author2=Davis, Garrett |author3=Britt, Tara | title = Tracheal collapse frustrating; minimally invasive techniques promising | journal = DVM | pages = 2S–5S | publisher = Advanstar Communications |date=June 2006 }}</ref>

Tracheal collapse has also been described in [[horse]]s, both as a congenital condition and as a result of trauma. It is most commonly seen in the cervical trachea.<ref>{{cite web|vauthors=Ohnesorge B, Gehlen H, Deegen E |year=2002|title=Disorders of the Trachea in Horses|work=Equine Respiratory Diseases|url=http://www.ivis.org/special_books/Lekeux/ohnesorge/chapter_frm.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref>
