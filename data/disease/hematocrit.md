The '''hematocrit''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|m|æ|t|ə|k|r|ɪ|t}}) ('''Ht''' or '''HCT'''), also known by [[#Names|several other names]], is the [[volume fraction#Volume percent|volume percentage]] (vol%) of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs) in [[blood]],<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Mondal H, Lotfollahzadeh S | chapter = Hematocrit |date=2024 | title = StatPearls | chapter-url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542276/ |access-date=2024-04-23 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=31194416 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Hematocrit Test: What It Is, Levels, High & Low Range |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17683-hematocrit |access-date=2024-04-23 |website=Cleveland Clinic |language=en}}</ref> measured as part of a [[blood test]].<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003646.htm|title=Hematocrit | encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine |language=en|access-date=2020-02-05|archive-date=2020-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928153118/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003646.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The measurement depends on the number and size of red blood cells.<ref name="MedlinePlus" /> It is normally 40.7–50.3% for males and 36.1–44.3% for females.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/> It is a part of a person's [[complete blood count]] results,<ref name="blood disorder"/> along with [[hemoglobin]] concentration, [[white blood cell]] count and [[platelet]] count.

Because the purpose of red blood cells is to transfer oxygen from the lungs to body tissues, a blood sample's hematocrit—the red blood cell volume percentage—can become a point of reference of its capability of delivering oxygen.

==Names==
There are other names for the hematocrit, such as ''packed cell volume'' (PCV), ''volume of packed red cells'' (VPRC), or ''erythrocyte volume fraction'' (EVF). The term ''hematocrit'' (or ''haematocrit'' in [[British English]]) comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc-Latn|haima}} ({{lang|grc|αἷμα}}, "blood") and {{lang|grc-Latn|kritēs}} ({{lang|grc|κριτής}}, "judge"), and hematocrit means "to separate blood".<ref name="urmc">{{cite encyclopedia | veditors = Haldeman-Englert C, Turley Jr R, Novick T |url= http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&ContentID=hematocrit |title=Hematocrit | encyclopedia = Health Encyclopedia | publisher = University of Rochester Medical Center |access-date=2015-02-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214034042/http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&ContentID=hematocrit |archive-date=2015-02-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hematocrit|title=Hematocrit|access-date=2015-02-14|archive-date=2015-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214031900/http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hematocrit|url-status=live | work = The Free Dictionary }}</ref> It was coined in 1891 by Swedish physiologist [[Magnus Blix]] as ''haematokrit'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blix M, Hedin SG |year=1891 |title=Der Haematokrit |trans-title=The Haematokrit |language=de |journal=Zeitschrift für Analytische Chemie |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=652–54 |doi=10.1007/BF01592182 |s2cid=197597332 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1587842 |access-date=2019-08-24 |archive-date=2022-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304072911/https://zenodo.org/record/1587842 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hedin SG |journal=Skandinavisches Archiv für Physiologie |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=134–40 |year=1891 |title=Der Hämatokrit, ein neuer Apparat zur Untersuchung des Blutes |trans-title=The Haematokrit: a New Apparatus for the Investigation of Blood |language=de |doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1891.tb00578.x |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447675 |access-date=2019-12-12 |archive-date=2020-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205153942/https://zenodo.org/record/1447675 |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors = Reiser SJ |title=Medicine and the reign of technology |date= 1981 |publisher=Cambridge Univ.

==Measurement methods==
[[File:Packed cell volume diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of packed cell volume]]

With modern lab equipment, the hematocrit can be calculated by an [[automated analyzer]] or directly measured, depending on the analyzer manufacturer. Calculated hematocrit is determined by multiplying the red cell count by the [[Mean corpuscular volume|mean cell volume]]. The hematocrit is slightly more accurate, as the PCV includes small amounts of [[blood plasma]] trapped between the red cells. An estimated hematocrit as a percentage may be derived by tripling the [[hemoglobin]] concentration in [[gram|g]]/[[decilitre|dL]] and dropping the units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/hematology/labs/hematocrit.htm|title=Hematocrit (HCT) or Packed Cell Volume (PCV) | work = The Doctors Lounge |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102133232/http://www.doctorslounge.com/hematology/labs/hematocrit.htm|archive-date=2008-01-02 }}</ref>

The packed cell volume (PCV) can be determined by [[centrifuge|centrifuging]] [[EDTA]]-treated or [[heparin]]ized blood in a [[capillary tube]] (also known as a microhematocrit tube) at 10,000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]] for five minutes.<ref name="Hematocrit">{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Hematocrit.html |title= Hematocrit |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Surgery: A Guide for Patients and Caregivers |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060612175923/http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Hematocrit.html |archive-date= 2006-06-12 }}</ref> This separates the blood into layers. The volume of packed red blood cells divided by the total volume of the blood sample gives the PCV. Since a tube is used, this can be calculated by measuring the lengths of the layers.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

Another way of measuring hematocrit levels is by optical methods such as [[spectrophotometry]].<ref>{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6606509 |title=Method and apparatus for improving the accuracy of noninvasive hematocrit measurements | url = https://www.google.com/patents/US6606509 | inventor = Schmitt JM | assign = Covidien LP }}</ref> Through differential spectrophotometry, the differences in optical densities of a blood sample flowing through small-bore glass tubes at [[isosbestic]] wavelengths for deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and the product of the luminal diameter and hematocrit create a linear relationship that is used to measure hematocrit levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lipowsky HH, Usami S, Chien S, Pittman RN | title = Hematocrit determination in small bore tubes by differential spectrophotometry | journal = Microvascular Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–55 | date = July 1982 | pmid = 7121311 | doi = 10.1016/0026-2862(82)90041-3 }}</ref>

Other than potential bruising at the puncture site, and/or dizziness, there are no complications associated with this test.<ref name="Hematocrit"/>

While known hematocrit levels are used in detecting conditions, it may fail at times due to hematocrit being the measure of concentration of red blood cells through volume in a blood sample. It does not account for the mass of the red blood cells, and thus the changes in mass can alter a hematocrit level or go undetected while affecting a subject's condition.<ref>{{cite book | title = Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology | volume = 1 | vauthors = Greer JP | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | date = 2009 }}</ref> Additionally, there have been cases in which the blood for testing was inadvertently drawn proximal to an intravenous line that was infusing packed red cells or fluids. In these situations, the hemoglobin level in the blood sample will not be the true level for the patient because the sample will contain a large amount of the infused material rather than what is diluted into the circulating whole blood. That is, if packed red cells are being supplied, the sample will contain a large amount of those cells and the hematocrit will be artificially very high.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

Hematocrit can vary from the determining factors of the number of red blood cells. These factors can be from the age and sex of the subject.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<ref name="drkaslow">{{cite web | vauthors = Kaslow JE | date = 2015 |url=http://www.drkaslow.com/html/blood_cell_counts.html |title=Blood-Cell count |access-date=2015-02-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214005324/http://www.drkaslow.com/html/blood_cell_counts.html |archive-date=2015-02-14 }}</ref> Typically, a higher hematocrit level signifies the blood sample's ability to transport oxygen,<ref name="amzoo">{{cite journal | vauthors = Birchard GF |year=1997 |title=Optimal Hematocrit: Theory, Regulation and Implications |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.1093/icb/37.1.65 |jstor=3883938|doi-access=free }}</ref> which has led to reports that an "optimal hematocrit level" may exist. Optimal hematocrit levels have been studied through combinations of assays on blood sample's hematocrit itself, viscosity, and hemoglobin level.<ref name="amzoo"/>

Hematocrit levels also serve as an indicator of health conditions. Thus, tests on hematocrit levels are often carried out in the process of diagnosis of such conditions,<ref name="MedlinePlus"/> and may be conducted prior to surgery.<ref name="urmc"/> Additionally, the health conditions associated with certain hematocrit levels are the same as ones associated with certain hemoglobin levels. As blood flows from the arterioles into the capillaries, a change in pressure occurs. In order to maintain pressure, the capillaries branch off to a web of vessels that carry blood into the venules. Through this process blood undergoes micro-circulation. In micro-circulation, the [[Fåhræus effect]] will take place, resulting in a large change in hematocrit. As blood flows through the arterioles, red cells will act a feed hematocrit (Hf), while in the capillaries, a tube hematocrit (Ht) occurs. In tube hematocrit, plasma fills most of the vessel while the red cells travel through in somewhat of a single file line. From this stage, blood will enter the venules increasing in hematocrit, in other words the discharge hematocrit (Hd).In large vessels with low hematocrit, viscosity dramatically drops and red cells take in a lot of energy.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

==Shear rate relations==

Relationships between hematocrit, viscosity, and shear rate are important factors to put into consideration. Since blood is non-Newtonian, the viscosity of the blood is in relation to the hematocrit, and as a function of shear rate. This is important when it comes to determining shear force, since a lower hematocrit level indicates that there is a need for more force to push the red blood cells through the system. This is because shear rate is defined as the rate to which adjacent layers of fluid move in respect to each other.<ref name="pmid15807389">{{cite journal | vauthors = Papaioannou TG, Stefanadis C | title = Vascular wall shear stress: basic principles and methods | journal = Hellenic Journal of Cardiology | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15807389 | doi = | url = http://www.hellenicjcardiol.org/archive/full_text/2005/1/2005_1_9.pdf |access-date=2015-04-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415203900/http://www.hellenicjcardiol.org/archive/full_text/2005/1/2005_1_9.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-15 }}</ref> Plasma is a more viscous material than typically red blood cells, since they are able to adjust their size to the radius of a tube; the shear rate is purely dependent on the amount of red blood cells being forced in a vessel.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nader E, Skinner S, Romana M, Fort R, Lemonne N, Guillot N, Gauthier A, Antoine-Jonville S, Renoux C, Hardy-Dessources MD, Stauffer E, Joly P, Bertrand Y, Connes P | title = Blood Rheology: Key Parameters, Impact on Blood Flow, Role in Sickle Cell Disease and Effects of Exercise | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 10 | pages = 1329 | date = 2019-10-17 | pmid = 31749708 | pmc = 6842957 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2019.01329 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Hematocrit levels were also reported to be correlated with social factors that influence subjects. In the 1966–80 Health Examination Survey, there was a small rise in mean hematocrit levels in female and male adolescents that reflected a rise in annual family income. Additionally, a higher education in a parent has been put into account for a rise in mean hematocrit levels of the child.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heald F, Levy PS, Hamill PV, Rowland M | title = Hematocrit values of youths 12-17 years | journal = Vital and Health Statistics.

===Lowered===
Lowered hematocrit levels also pose health impacts. These causes and impacts have been reported:
* A low hematocrit level is a sign of a low red blood cell count. One way to increase the ability of oxygen transport in red blood cells is through blood transfusion, which is carried out typically when the red blood cell count is low. Prior to the blood transfusion, hematocrit levels are measured to help ensure the transfusion is necessary and safe.<ref>{{cite book | veditors = Miller RD | chapter = Transfusion therapy.

* A low hematocrit with a low [[mean corpuscular volume]] (MCV) with a high [[Red blood cell distribution width|red cell distribution width]] (RDW) suggests a chronic iron-deficient anemia resulting in abnormal hemoglobin synthesis during [[erythropoiesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallerstein RO | title = Laboratory evaluation of anemia | journal = The Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–451 | date = April 1987 | pmid = 3577135 | pmc = 1307333 }}</ref> The MCV and the RDW can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal hematocrit, because they can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute, although acute blood loss typically does not manifest as a change in hematocrit, since hematocrit is simply a measure of how much of the blood volume is made up of red blood cells. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population.
