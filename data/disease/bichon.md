{{main|Bichon Frisé}}
The Bichon Frisé, formally known as the Bichon Tenerife, Tenerife dog or Canary Island lap dog, was bred on the island of [[Tenerife]]; it was believed to be descended from bichon-type dogs introduced from [[Spain]] in the 16th century.{{sfnp|Morris|2001|pp=514-515}}{{sfnp|Alderton|2008|p=108}} From the Canary Islands, the breed was imported back to the Continent where it became the sometimes favourite of the European courts, its fortunes depending upon the fashions of the time; during an ebb in the breed's popularity it found its way into a number of [[circus]]es, performing throughout Europe with organ grinders.{{sfnp|Morris|2001|pp=514-515}}{{sfnp|Alderton|2008|p=108}} The breed again fell out of favour from the end of the 19th century and it was due to the efforts of Belgian and French enthusiasts in the 1930s that rescued it from extinction, which is why it is today recognised as a Franco-Belgian dog breed.{{sfnp|Morris|2001|pp=514-515}}{{sfnp|Rice|2002|p=97}}

===Bolonka Franzuska===
The name of the breed means French lap dog (franzuskaja = French, Bolonka = lap dog, French Bichon). Since the Renaissance, Bolognese lap dogs have enjoyed great popularity and admiration in princely and royal houses. The close ties between the French and Russian nobility led to the spread of the lap dogs of the French ladies to tsarist Russia. Even Catherine the Great loved and adored these dwarf puppies. She owned a few puppies during her reign at the Romanov Tsar's Court.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hunde.de/hund/hunderassen/267/bolonka-franzuska.html | title=Hunderassen &#124; Bolonka franzuska }}</ref>
