===Viral===
{{main|Viral encephalitis|Herpesviral encephalitis}}
Viral infections are the usual cause of infectious encephalitis.<ref name=":1" /> Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute [[infection]], or as one of the [[sequelae]] of a [[latent infection]]. The majority of viral cases of encephalitis have an unknown cause; however, the most common identifiable cause of viral encephalitis is from [[herpes simplex]] infection.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Roos KL, Tyler KL |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-180215-4|edition=19|chapter-url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=1130&sectionid=79734335|chapter=Meningitis, Encephalitis, Brain Abscess, and Empyema|access-date=2017-11-17|archive-date=2017-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122546/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=1130&sectionid=79734335|url-status=live}}</ref> Other causes of acute viral encephalitis are [[rabies virus]], [[poliovirus]], and [[measles virus]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher DL, Defres S, Solomon T | title = Measles-induced encephalitis | journal = QJM | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–182 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 24865261 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcu113 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Additional possible viral causes are [[Arbovirus|arboviral]] [[flavivirus]] ([[Saint Louis encephalitis|St. Louis encephalitis]], [[West Nile virus]]), [[bunyavirus]] (La Crosse strain), [[arenavirus]] (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), [[Reoviridae|reovirus]] (Colorado tick virus), and [[henipavirus]] infections.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy PG | title = Viral encephalitis: causes, differential diagnosis, and management | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 75 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = i10–i15 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14978145 | pmc = 1765650 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2003.034280 | url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/75/suppl_1/i10 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002151809/http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/75/suppl_1/i10 | archive-date = 2015-10-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Broder CC, Geisbert TW, Xu K, Nikolov DB, Wang LF, Middleton D, Pallister J, Bossart KN | title = Henipavirus | chapter = Immunization strategies against henipaviruses | series = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology | volume = 359 | pages = 197–223 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22481140 | pmc = 4465348 | doi = 10.1007/82_2012_213 | isbn = 978-3-642-29818-9 }}</ref> The [[Powassan virus]] is a rare cause of encephalitis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Symptoms & Treatment {{!}} Powassan {{!}} CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/symptoms.html |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=26 June 2019 |language=en-us |date=4 December 2018 |archive-date=26 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626032132/https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/symptoms.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Certain [[parasitic]] or [[protozoa]]l infestations, such as [[toxoplasmosis]], [[malaria]], or [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis]], can also cause encephalitis in people with [[immune deficiency|compromised]] [[immune system]]s. [[Lyme disease]] or ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'' may also cause encephalitis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Other bacterial pathogens, like ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' and those causing [[rickettsial disease]], cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Howes DS, Lazoff M, Conrad SA, Hemphill RR, Huff JS, Pritz T, Talavera F | veditors = Brenner BE |title = Encephalitis: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/791896-overview#a4|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150803144051/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/791896-overview#a4|archive-date = 2015-08-03|date = 2018-08-07 | work = MedScape }}</ref>

===Limbic encephalitis===
{{Main|Limbic encephalitis}}

Limbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the [[limbic system]] of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes [[disorientation]], [[disinhibition]], [[memory loss]], [[seizures]], and behavioral anomalies. [[MRI]] imaging reveals T2 [[hyperintensity]] in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Neuropsychological Neurology: The Neurocognitive Impairments of Neurological Disorders|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hO_lWEDsJYMC&q=limbic+encephalitis+definition&pg=PA156|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-05-02|isbn = 978-1-107-60760-6|first = A.

===Autoimmune encephalitis===
{{Main|Autoimmune encephalitis}}

Autoimmune encephalitis signs can include [[catatonia]], [[psychosis]], [[abnormal]] movements, and autonomic [[dysregulation]]. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and [[Rasmussen's encephalitis|Rasmussen encephalitis]] are examples of autoimmune encephalitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Armangue T, Petit-Pedrol M, Dalmau J | title = Autoimmune encephalitis in children | journal = Journal of Child Neurology | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 1460–1469 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22935553 | pmc = 3705178 | doi = 10.1177/0883073812448838 }}</ref> [[Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]] is the most common autoimmune form, and is accompanied by [[ovarian]] [[teratoma]] in 58 percent of affected women 18–45 years of age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalmau J, Graus F | title = Antibody-Mediated Encephalitis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 378 | issue = 9 | pages = 840–851 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29490181 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1708712 | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 3623281 | hdl = 2445/147222 }}</ref>

===Encephalitis lethargica===
{{main|Encephalitis lethargica}}

[[Encephalitis lethargica]] is identified by high fever, [[headache]], delayed physical response, and [[lethargy]]. Individuals can exhibit upper body [[weakness]], [[muscular pain]]s, and [[tremor]]s, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis [[lethargica]] occurred worldwide.<ref>{{NINDS|encephalitis_lethargica}}</ref>
==Diagnosis==

* Brain scan, done by [[MRI]], can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.
* [[EEG]], in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.
* [[Lumbar puncture]] (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.
* Blood test
* Urine analysis
* [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) testing of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], to detect the presence of viral [[DNA]] which is a sign of viral encephalitis.

==Treatment==
An ideal drug to treat brain infection should be small, moderately lipophilic at pH of 7.4, low level of plasma protein binding, volume of distribution of litre per kg, does not have strong affinity towards binding with [[P-glycoprotein]], or other efflux pumps on the surface of [[blood–brain barrier]].

==Terminology==

Encephalitis with [[meningitis]] is known as [[meningoencephalitis]], while encephalitis with involvement of the spinal cord is known as [[encephalomyelitis]].<ref name=NIH2017Fact/>

The word is from [[Ancient Greek]] {{Lang|grc|{{Script|Greek|ἐγκέφαλος}}}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|enképhalos}} 'brain',<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The University of Chicago Library |title=Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary |url=http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/dicos/woodhouse_test.pl?keyword=^Brain,%20subs. |access-date=2013-01-10 |language=de |archive-date=2017-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002545/http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/dicos/woodhouse_test.pl?keyword=%5EBrain%2C%20subs. |url-status=dead }}</ref> composed of {{Lang|grc|{{Script|Greek|ἐν}}}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|en}}, 'in' and {{Lang|grc|{{Script|Greek|κεφαλή}}}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|kephalé}}, 'head', and the medical suffix ''-itis'' 'inflammation'.<ref>The word seems to have had a meaning of “lithic imitation of the human brain” at first, according to the ''Trésor de la langue française informatisé'' (cf. the article on [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/encéphalite “encéphalite”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194524/http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/enc%C3%A9phalite |date=2017-11-05 }}). The first use in the medical sense is attested from the early 19th century in French (J. Capuron, ''Nouveau dictionnaire de médecine, chirurgie…'', 1806), and from 1843 in English respectively (cf. the article [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=encephalitis “encephalitis”] in the ''Online Etymology Dictionary'').
