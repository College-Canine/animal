The '''Border Collie''' is a British [[list of dog breeds|breed]] of [[herding dog]] of the [[collie]] type of medium size. It originates in the region of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]], and descends from the traditional sheepdogs once found all over the [[British Isles]]. It is kept mostly as a working sheep-herding dog or as a [[companion animal]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The dog encyclopedia|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|last1=Dennis-Bryan|first1=Kim|last2=Baggaley|first2=Ann|last3=John|first3=Katie|isbn=9781465421166|edition= First American |location=New York|pages=49–51|oclc=859155647|date = October 2013}}</ref> It competes with success in [[sheepdog trial]]s.

==History==
[[File:Male Border Collie Puppy On First Walk.jpg|alt=Male Border Collie Puppy - 8 Weeks|thumb|An 8-week-old male Border Collie puppy]]
The border collie is descended from [[landrace]] [[collie]]s, a type found widely in the [[British Isles]]. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border.<ref name="American Kennel Club">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/border-collie/#standard |title=American Kennel Club - Border Collie |publisher=Akc.org|access-date=2010-09-13}}</ref> Mention of the "collie" or "Colley" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word "collie" is older than this and has its origin in the [[Scots language]]. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best border collies today can be traced back to a dog known as [[Old Hemp]].<ref>McCulloch, John Herries (1952). ''Border Collie studies''. WSN (Maps and Plans). {{ISBN|978-1-85829-066-9}}.</ref>{{rp|4}}

In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the [[International Sheep Dog Society]] (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term "border collie" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the [[Kennel Club]]'s collie (or [[Scotch collie]], including the [[rough collie]] and [[smooth collie]]) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different breeds.<ref>[http://www.barkbytes.com/history/Collie.htm Collie Breed History] Lee Weston, www.barkbytes.com.

Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure border collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bordercolliemuseum.org/AuldHemp/AULDHEMP.html|title=BC Museum: AULDHEMP|website=www.bordercolliemuseum.org|access-date=2017-01-15}}</ref> He was believed to have sired as many as 200 pups over the span of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://colliepoint.com/border-collie-history/|title=Border Collie History: From Old Hemp to New Beginnings - Collie Point|website=colliepoint.com|date=18 October 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>

Wiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963)<ref name="http://db.kennel.dk/">{{cite web|url=http://db.kennel.dk/ |title=Border Collie Database |publisher=Db.kennel.dk |date=2002-08-08 |access-date=2010-09-13}}</ref> is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic border collie herding pose. He was a popular [[Dog breeding|stud dog]] in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern-day collie.<ref name="allbordercollies.com"/> Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the studbook, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.

===Introduction to New Zealand and Australia===
Collies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TC18580611.2.4|title=Imports.|date=1858-06-11|work=Colonist|access-date=2018-04-18|pages=2}}</ref> In the late 1890s James Lilico<ref>{{Cite book|title=The breeding and training of sheep dogs|last=Lilico|first=James|publisher=Southland News|year=1920|isbn=978-3-540-63293-1|location=Invercargill, New Zealand}}</ref> (1861?–1945) of [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], imported a number of working dogs from the [[United Kingdom]]. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hartingdale.com.au/~wkc/HisDtrialsHTML.htm|title=Historical Sheepdog Trials|last=Cooper|first=Barbara}}</ref> born in Hindhope, [[Scotland]] in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.

It is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a ''British Hunts and Huntsmen'' article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.noonbarra.com/history.html|title=Origin And History of the Australian Working Kelpie}}</ref>

<blockquote>Mr. Elliot himself is well known for his breed of collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of [[New Zealand]] and Australia.<ref>{{cite mailing list|url=http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/BORDER/1998-06/0897939178|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226113957/http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/BORDER/1998-06/0897939178|archive-date=2016-12-26|mailing-list=[[RootsWeb]]: BORDER-L|title=Re: GLENDINNING|first=Trish|last=Pattison|date=15 June 1998 |access-date=2009-12-10}}</ref></blockquote>

When her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to ''Captain'', another of the then-new "border" strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the "best to cross the equator".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonnidune.com/info.html|title=Border Collie Breed Information|last=Whiteman|first=Kelly|website=www.bonnidune.com|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>

In 1901 the King and Mcleod stud was created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near [[Nyngan]] (north-west of [[Sydney]]), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheepdog trials.

The [[New Zealand Heading Dog]] breed was developed from Border Collies.

Border Collies are, on average, medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of [[Coat (dog)|coat]], which is often thick and prone to shedding. They have a [[Coat (dog)|double coat]] that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most common colouring of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]], blue merle, [[brindle]], and Australian red (also known as [[Dog coat|ee]] red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some border collies may also have single-colour coats.<ref name="American Kennel Club"/>

Eye colour varies from brown to green, and occasionally [[Heterochromia iridum|eyes of differing colour]] occur; this is usually seen with merles. This trait is known as heterochromia. The ears of the border collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the [[Rough Collie|rough collie]]). 

Although working border collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bordercollie.org/kpwhite.html|title=A Dog of a Different Color|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501085658/http://www.bordercollie.org/kpwhite.html|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog's appearance to be irrelevant.<ref name="abca-about">{{cite web|url=http://americanbordercollie.org/bc-information/choosing-a-border-collie/|title=How to choose a border collie|publisher=American Border Collie Association|access-date=2 March 2018}}</ref> Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working border collie by its attitude and ability.

Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working border collies since to win in [[Dog show|conformation showing]] they must conform closely to [[Breed club (dog)|breed club]] [[Breed standard (dogs)|standards]] that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the border collie must have a "keen and intelligent" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a border collie in the show ring. The males' height from [[withers]] comes from {{convert|19|to|22|in|cm|order=flip}}, females from {{convert|18|to|21|in|cm|order=flip}}.

It has been claimed to be the most [[Dog intelligence|intelligent]] breed of dog.<ref name="coren" /><ref>{{Cite book| last = Coren | first = Stanley | author-link = Stanley Coren | title = The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions (Paperback) | publisher = [[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-7432-8087-7 }}</ref>

===Common health problems===
[[Collie eye anomaly]] (CEA) and [[Epilepsy in animals|epilepsy]] are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time.<ref>[http://americanbordercollie.org/bc-information/heath-and-genetics/ Health and Genetics of Border Collies] www.americanbordercollie.org. Retrieved 2 January 2018.</ref>

CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the [[retina]], [[choroid]], and [[sclera]] that sometimes affects border collies. In border collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However, other eye conditions such as PRA<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.petplan.com.au/blog/petpeople/border-collie-buying-information/|title=What To Know if You're Buying a Border Collie - Petplan Blog|website=www.petplan.com.au|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404084653/https://www.petplan.com.au/blog/petpeople/border-collie-buying-information/|archive-date=4 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause border collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a [[Genetic testing|DNA test]] available for CEA<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.optigen.com/opt9_test_cea_ch.html|title=OptiGen - New Genetic Test for Collie Eye Anomaly / Choroidal Hypoplasia - CEA/CH Test - canine genetic testing|website=www.optigen.com|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups.

There are different types of hip testing available including [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and [[PennHIP|PennHip]]. [[Radiography|Radiographs]] are taken and sent to these organisations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality.

[[Elbow dysplasia]] may also occur in the breed. Dogs [[Zygosity|homozygous]] for the [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]] gene, sometimes referred to as "double merles", are likely to have sight and/or hearing defects.

Two types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in border collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Platt|first1=Simon|last2=Freeman|first2=Julia|last3=di Stefani|first3=Alberta|last4=Wieczorek|first4=Lara|last5=Henley|first5=William|date=November 2006 |title= Prevalence of unilateral and bilateral deafness in border collies and association with phenotype|journal=Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1355–1362|issn=0891-6640|pmid=17186850|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2006.tb00751.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.576.2252}}</ref> The second type is known as adult-onset hearing loss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://purinaproclub.com/Dog/ResourceLibrary/BreederEnthusiastResources/TodaysBreeder/639c9127-5f9c-4fec-af28-5cab2b2fdf72/6f9d1218-59a9-49e6-bf51-de0a1d625bd4|title=Discovering Inherited Adult-Onset Deafness in Border Collies|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216163100/http://purinaproclub.com/Dog/ResourceLibrary/BreederEnthusiastResources/TodaysBreeder/639c9127-5f9c-4fec-af28-5cab2b2fdf72/6f9d1218-59a9-49e6-bf51-de0a1d625bd4|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age.

[[Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis]] (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show border collies. NCL results in severe [[Neurology|neurological]] impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The [[mutation]] causing the form of the disease found in border collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, [[University of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/bordercollie.html |title=Dog disease gets the bite |publisher=Science.unsw.edu.au |year=2005 |access-date=2007-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810133722/http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/bordercollie.html |archive-date=2007-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.

Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces [[neutrophil]]s (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in border collies, in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Genetic Connection: A Guide to Health Problems in Purebred Dogs |last=Ackerman |first=Lowell |year=2011 |publisher=American Animal Hospital Association Press |isbn=978-1-58326-157-6 |page=219 }}<!--|access-date=26 June 2012--></ref>

A syndrome of exercise-induced collapse similar to that seen in [[Labrador retriever]]s, otherwise termed '''Border Collie Collapse''' and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvm.umn.edu/vbs/faculty/Mickelson/lab/EIC/bordercollieEIC/|title=Border Collie Collapse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928220641/http://www.cvm.umn.edu/vbs/faculty/Mickelson/lab/EIC/bordercollieEIC/|archive-date=28 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Border Collie Collapse or "the wobbles" is a disease found in many herding/working breeds. The cause is currently unknown. Border Collie Collapse seems to be related to high-intensity exercises that are found to be particularly exciting to the individual dog. For example, some dogs cannot retrieve a tennis ball, as they find this activity highly stimulating, but can run for several miles with no symptoms of Border Collie Collapse. Symptoms commonly include disorientation, mental dullness, loss of attention, unsteady hind legs, dragging of hind legs, and ultimately the need to sit or lie down. Loss of consciousness and seizure-like trembling/spasms are not characteristics of Border Collie Collapse. There is no current diagnostic test or veterinary workup that can confirm Border Collie Collapse and the diagnosis is often given as a diagnosis of exclusion or based on clinical symptoms. There is no current treatment recommended, and it is advised to limit the episodes by avoiding the activities that trigger the collapse.<ref name="taylor3">{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=SM |last2=Minor |first2=K |last3=Shmon |first3=CL |last4=Shelton |first4=GD |last5=Patterson |first5=EE |last6=Mickelson |first6=JR |title=Border collie collapse: Owner survey results and veterinary description of episodes |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |date=2016 |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=364–370|doi=10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6436 |pmid=27685362 }}</ref>

==Breed standards==
[[File:Border Collie blanca y negra Cachorra (Bimba de los Baganicos).jpg|thumb|Black & white Border Collie. Female puppy.]]
There are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS [[sheepdog trial]] and appearance.

===ISDS sheepdog trial===
The original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international.

===Appearance===
<!--Please do not post snapshots of your beloved dog unless they illustrate the characteristic appearance and activities of the breed in an encyclopedic manner-->
In nearly every region of the world, the border collie is now also a breed that is shown in a ring or bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and [[Australia]], where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with a long double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined [[wikt:stop#Noun|stop]], semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]]. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a powerful herding instinct.

===Criticism of show dog conformity based on appearance===
Other enthusiasts oppose the use of border collies as show dogs, for fear that breeding for appearance will lead to a decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in [[conformation show]]s, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than an appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in [[Kennel Club]]-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation-based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or [[flyball]]; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.

==Registries==
=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom the dogs can be registered with the national [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] like any other recognised breed; a [[breed society]], the International Sheep Dog Society,<ref>[http://www.isds.org.uk/ The International Sheep Dog Society]. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> registers only dogs with proven herding ability.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===United States===
[[File:SlabCityS-14.png|thumb|A Border Collie registered with the AKC and having an ABCA certificate of descent]]

Two of the principal registries for border collies in the United States are the American Border Collie Association (ABCA) and the National Border Collie Association (NBCA), both of which are dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://americanbordercollie.org/about/bylaws/|title=Bylaws {{!}} American Border Collie Association|website=American Border Collie Association|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest<ref name="bcorg3">[http://www.bordercollie.org/culture/culture.html The AKC Controversy] www.bordercollie.org. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> from the majority of border collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of border collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |date=2010-07-09 |access-date=2010-09-13}}</ref> By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 border collies annually.<ref>[http://www.americanbordercollie.org/news.htm American Border Collie Association News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429045700/http://www.americanbordercollie.org/news.htm |date=2007-04-29 }} www.americanbordercollie.org. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA, NASDS, and NBCA. but none of the working registries in the U.S. honours AKC pedigrees, with the exception of the NBCA which will accept a transfer of registration from AKC.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], Border collies are [[breed registry|registered]] with an [[Australian National Kennel Council]] (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed border collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986.<ref>[http://www.ankc.aust.com/nrs_group5.html National Registration Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819052505/http://www.ankc.aust.com/nrs_group5.html |date=19 August 2006 }} 19 August 2006, at the [[Wayback Machine]]. Australian National Kennel Association. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows border collies to compete in [[conformation show|conformation]], [[obedience trial|obedience]], [[dog agility|agility]], [[tracking trial|tracking]], [[disc dog]], herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.

===Canada===
In Canada, [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|Agriculture Canada]] has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association<ref>[http://www.canadianbordercollies.org/ Canadian Border Collie Association] www.canadianbordercollies.org. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any border collie that is designated as a "Pure Breed" in Canada.

The criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a "B" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the "A" registry.

Recently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if border collies should be included on the CKC "Miscellaneous List". This designation would allow border collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.

===South Africa===
The registration of working sheepdogs in [[South Africa]] is the responsibility of the [[South African Sheepdog Association]]. ISDS-registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for hip dysplasia and collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.

===Turkey===
The registration of working border collies in [[Turkey]] is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association)<ref>[http://www.border-Collie-dernegi.org/ Border Collie Dernegi] Turkish Border Collie Association. Retrieved 13 July 2008.</ref> established in 2007.

===Elsewhere===
The border collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheepdog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF),<ref>[http://www.isdf.org.uk/ International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829020219/http://www.isdf.org.uk/ |date=29 August 2011 }} 29 August 2011, at the Wayback Machine. Retrieved 13 July 2008.</ref> based in [[Piccadilly]], London, UK.

==Activities==
Border collies are one of the most popular breeds for [[dog agility]] competitions. They also excel at competitive [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[sheepdog trials]] and [[herding]] events.<ref name="Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor">{{cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-1-57779-106-5}}</ref>

==Livestock work==
[[File:BC eye.jpg|thumb|left|The Border Collie uses a direct stare at sheep, known as "the eye", to intimidate while herding.]]
[[File:Herding-6.png|thumb|Black and white Border Collie herding a sheep]]
Working border collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd a variety of animals, from the traditional [[sheep]] and [[cattle]], to free-range [[poultry]], [[pig]]s, and [[Common ostrich|ostriches]]. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-piper-airport-wildlife-control-dog-runways-safe/story?id=37286003|title=Meet Piper, the Airport K-9 Wildlife Control Dog Who Keeps Runways Safe|last=Borrello |first=Steve |work=ABC News |date=29 February 2016|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref>

Shepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, [[North Wales]], in 1873.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.isds.org.uk/society/history/index.htm|title=ISDS History|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611190015/http://www.isds.org.uk/society/history/index.htm|archive-date=11 June 2007}}</ref> These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.

In the US, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA.<ref>[http://www.usbcha.com/ Official Page of the USBCHA]. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA)<ref>[http://www.canadianbordercollies.org/ Canadian Border Collie Association]. Retrieved 12 August 2007.</ref> and in [[South Africa]] it is the South African Sheepdog Association.

===Dog sports===
Border collies excel at several [[List of dog sports|dog sports]] in addition to their success in sheepdog trials due to their high instinct for herding. Herding instincts and trainability can be tested when introduced to sheep or at noncompetitive instinct tests. Border collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in sheepdog trials and other herding events.<ref name="Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor" /> They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, "Anything But Collies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agilitynet.co.uk/shows/abcagility_semifinals2008.html |title=KC ABC Agility Semi-Finals |publisher=Agilitynet.co.uk |date=2008-07-15 |access-date=2010-09-13}}</ref>

The border collie's speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and [[disc dog]] competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in [[Musical canine freestyle|dog dancing]] competitions.

Border collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for [[Tracking (dog)|tracking trials]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justusdogs.com.au/dog-pages/dog-breeds/538/border-Collie.cfm |title=Border Collie |publisher=Justusdogs.com.au|access-date=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325111147/http://www.justusdogs.com.au/dog-pages/dog-breeds/538/border-collie.cfm |archive-date=25 March 2010 }}</ref> These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs. Border Collies are used as search dogs in mountain rescue in Britain. They are particularly useful for searching large areas of hillside and [[avalanche]] debris. Hamish MacInnes believed that dark-coated dogs are less prone to snow blindness.<ref>Hamish MacInnes, ''International Mountain Rescue Handbook'' (London; Constable, 1972)47-63</ref>

==Research==
The impressive intelligence of the Border Collie has made it a viable subject for research. In particular, the [[Georgia Tech|Georgia Institute of Technology's]] FIDO (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations) project demonstrated the ability of intelligent dogs to communicate with humans. In particular, Professor Melody Jackson, director of the institute's BrainLab, instrumented a Border Collie named Sky to activate a sensor worn by the dog which allowed Sky to communicate in audible English with its handler. One intent was to allow service dogs to warn their owners of impending danger, or to alert others to emergency situations involving their handler, especially those situations which might have resulted in the incapacitation of their handler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fido.gatech.edu |title=Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|access-date=2021-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iaIQktV26M | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/1iaIQktV26M| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=Georgia Tech's 'FIDO Vest' gives service dogs a voice |publisher=Fox5 Atlanta News via Giancarlo Valentin on YouTube|access-date=2021-06-27}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/fido-gets-even-techier-tools-6C10760884 |title="Fido gets even techier tools" by Nidhi Subbaraman, July 31, 2013|date=31 July 2013 |publisher=NBC Tech News|access-date=2021-06-27}}</ref>
