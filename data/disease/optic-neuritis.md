'''Optic neuritis''' describes any condition that causes inflammation of the [[optic nerve]]; it may be associated with [[demyelinating disease]]s, or infectious or inflammatory processes.<ref name=":0"/>

It is also known as [[optic papillitis]] (when the head of the optic nerve is involved), neuroretinitis (when there is a combined involvement of the [[optic disc]] and surrounding [[retina]] in the macular area) and retrobulbar neuritis (when the posterior part of the nerve is involved).<!--http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/acute-optic-neuritis--> Prelaminar optic neuritis describes involvement of the non-myelinated [[axon]]s in the retina.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Petzold |first1=Axel |last2=Fraser |first2=Clare L |last3=Abegg |first3=Mathias |last4=Alroughani |first4=Raed |last5=Alshowaeir |first5=Daniah |last6=Alvarenga |first6=Regina |last7=Andris |first7=Cécile |last8=Asgari |first8=Nasrin |last9=Barnett |first9=Yael |last10=Battistella |first10=Roberto |last11=Behbehani |first11=Raed |last12=Berger |first12=Thomas |last13=Bikbov |first13=Mukharram M |last14=Biotti |first14=Damien |last15=Biousse |first15=Valerie |date=December 2022 |title=Diagnosis and classification of optic neuritis |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442222002009 |journal=The Lancet Neurology |language=en |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1120–1134 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(22)00200-9|pmid=36179757 |s2cid=252564095 }}</ref> It is most often associated with [[multiple sclerosis]], and it may lead to complete or partial [[Visual impairment|loss of vision]] in one or both eyes.

Partial, transient vision loss (lasting less than one hour) can be an indication of early onset multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black's Medical Dictionary| publisher=A&C Black|year=2018|editor-last=Marcovitch|editor-first=Harvey|edition=43rd|via=Credo Reference}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:OpticNeuritisExample.jpg|right|thumb|Example of how optic neuritis affected one eye of a person with multiple sclerosis]]
Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision (partial or complete), sudden [[Blurred vision|blurred]] or "foggy" vision, and [[pain]] on movement of the affected eye.<ref>{{cite web|title=Optic neuritis|publisher=Mayo Clinic|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/optic-neuritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354953}}</ref> Early symptoms that require investigation include symptoms from multiple sclerosis (twitching, lack of coordination, slurred speech, frequent episodes of partial vision loss or blurred vision), episodes of "disturbed/blackened" rather than blurry indicate moderate stage and require immediate medical attention to prevent further loss of vision. Other early symptoms are reduced [[night vision]], [[photophobia]] and [[Red eye (medicine)|red eyes]]. Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their [[color vision]] in the affected eye (especially [[red]]), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. Patients may also experience difficulties judging movement in depth, which can be particular troublesome during driving or sport ([[Pulfrich effect]]). Likewise, transient worsening of vision with increase of body temperature ([[Uhthoff's phenomenon]]) and glare disability are a frequent complaint. However, several case studies in children have demonstrated the absence of pain in more than half of cases (approximately 60%) in their pediatric study population, with the most common symptom reported simply as "blurriness".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lucchinetti |first=C.

On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a [[slit lamp]] with a high positive lens or by using direct [[ophthalmoscopy]]; however, frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected, and patients may not be aware of the [[colour vision deficiency|loss of color vision]] until they are asked to close or cover the healthy eye.

Imaging of the optic nerve with MRI shows increased signal on the affected side. There is contrast enhancment of the symptomatic optic nerve and sheaths acutely or intrinsic signal increase (looking brighter) within ≥ 3 months.<ref name=":0"/> [[File:Case-3-mri.png|thumb|Magnetic Resonnance Imaging (MRI) during an episode of optic neuritis.]]
Advanced imaging using [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) is very sensitive reveal damage to the optic nerve. The OCT shows corresponding optic disc swelling acutely or an inter-eye difference in the thickness of the neurons and their nerves connecting the eye with the brain in above 4-5% within ≥ 3 months after onset.<ref name=":0"/>


== Cause ==
The [[optic nerve]] comprises [[axon]]s that emerge from the [[retina]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the [[occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] of the [[Human brain|brain]] to be processed into vision. [[Inflammation]] of the optic nerve causes loss of vision, usually because of the swelling and destruction of the [[myelin]] sheath covering the optic nerve.

The most common cause is [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) or [[ischemic optic neuropathy]] due to [[thrombosis]] or [[embolism]] of the vessel that supplies the optic nerve.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Rizzo JF, Lessell S|year=1991|title=Optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy. Overlapping clinical profiles|journal=Arch.

Almost half of the patients with optic neuritis have white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis.

Some other common causes of optic neuritis include infection (e.g. a [[Dental abscess|tooth abscess]] in the upper jaw, [[syphilis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[herpes zoster]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s (e.g. [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[neurosarcoidosis]], [[neuromyelitis optica]]), [[Methanol toxicity|methanol poisoning]], [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]], [[dysautonomia]] (i.e. [[autonomic nervous system]] dysfunction), and [[diabetes]], or an injury to the eye.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Clinical assessment of optic nerve disorders |first=P. |last=Riordan-Eva |date=1 January 2004 |journal=Eye |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1161–1168 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701575|pmid = 15534601|doi-access=free }}</ref> In neuromyelitis optica higher AQP4 [[autoantibody]] levels are associated with the occurrence of optic neuritis.<ref>Isobe N, Yonekawa T, Matsushita T, et al.

Less common causes are: [[papilledema]], [[brain tumor]] or abscess in the occipital region, [[Traumatic brain injury|cerebral trauma]] or [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], [[meningitis]], arachnoidal adhesions, sinus thrombosis, [[Liver disease|liver dysfunction]], or late stage [[kidney disease]].

=== Demyelinating recurrent optic neuritis and non-demyelinating (CRION) ===

The repetition of an idiopathic optic neuritis is considered a distinct clinical condition, and when it shows demyelination, it has been found to be associated to anti-[[Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|MOG]] and AQP4-negative [[neuromyelitis optica]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chalmoukou Konstantina | display-authors=etal | year=2015 | title=Recurrent Optic Neuritis (rON) is characterised by Anti-MOG Antibodies: A follow-up study | url=http://www.neurology.org/content/84/14_Supplement/P5.274| journal=Neurology | volume=84 | issue=14| page=274 | doi=10.1212/WNL.84.14_supplement.P5.274 }}</ref>

When an inflammatory recurrent optic neuritis is not demyelinating, it is called [[chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy]] (CRION).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kidd D. |author2=Burton B. |author3=Plant G. T. |author4=Graham E. M. | year=2003| title=Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) | journal=Brain | volume=126| issue=2| pages=276–284 | doi=10.1093/brain/awg045 |pmid=12538397 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

When it is anti-MOG related, it is demyelinating and it is considered inside the [[anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases]].

Some reports point to the possibility to establish a difference via [[optical coherence tomography]].<ref>Narayan et al. Unique characteristics of optical coherence tomography (OCT) results and visual acuity testing in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody positive pediatric patients, November 2018, MS and related disorders, Volume 28, February 2019, Pages 86-90, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2018.11.026</ref>

== Treatment ==
In most MS-associated optic neuritis, visual function spontaneously improves over 2–3 months, and there is evidence that [[corticosteroid]] treatment does not affect the long term outcome. However, for optic neuritis that is not MS-associated (or atypical optic neuritis) the evidence is less clear and therefore the threshold for treatment with intravenous corticosteroids is lower.<ref name=":0"/> Intravenous corticosteroids also reduce the risk of developing MS in the following two years in patients with MRI lesions; but this effect disappears by the third year of follow up.<ref name="The effect of corticosteroids for a">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beck RW, Cleary PA, Trobe JD, Kaufman DI, Kupersmith MJ, Paty DW, Brown CH |title=The effect of corticosteroids for acute optic neuritis on the subsequent development of multiple sclerosis. The Optic Neuritis Study Group |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=329 |issue=24 |pages=1764–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8232485 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199312093292403|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Paradoxically, oral administration of corticosteroids in this situation may lead to more recurrent attacks than in non-treated patients (though oral steroids are generally prescribed after the intravenous course, to wean the patient off the medication). This effect of corticosteroids seems to be limited to optic neuritis and has not been observed in other diseases treated with corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199202273260901 |vauthors=Beck RW, Cleary PA, Anderson MM, Keltner JL, Shults WT, Kaufman DI, Buckley EG, Corbett JJ, Kupersmith MJ, Miller NR |title=A randomized, controlled trial of corticosteroids in the treatment of acute optic neuritis. The Optic Neuritis Study Group |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=326 |issue=9 |pages=581–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1734247|doi-access=free }}</ref>

A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] studied the effect of corticosteroids for treating people with acute optic neuritis.<ref name="Vedula">{{cite journal |vauthors= Gal RL, Vedula SS, Beck R |title=Corticosteroids for treating optic neuritis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=CD001430 |date=2015 |pmid=26273799|pmc=4730547  |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001430.pub4}}</ref> Specific corticosteroids studied included intravenous and oral methylprednisone, and oral [[prednisone]]. The authors conclude that current evidence does not show a benefit of either intravenous or oral corticosteroids for rate of recovery of vision (in terms of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or visual fields).<ref name=Vedula /> There are a number of reasons why this might be the case.<ref name="The effect of corticosteroids for a"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Petzold A, Braithwaite T, Oosten BV, Balk L, Martinez-Lapiscina EH, Wheeler R, Wiegerinck N, Waters C, Plant GT |title=Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence. |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=jnnp-2019-321653 |year=2019 |pmid=31740484 | doi=10.1136/jnnp-2019-321653|pmc=6952848 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging 18–45 years of age, with a mean age of 30–35 years. There is a strong female predominance. The annual incidence is approximately 5/100,000, with a prevalence estimated to be 115/100,000 (0.12%).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodriguez M, Siva A, Cross SA, O'Brien PC, Kurland LT |title=Optic neuritis: a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota |journal=Neurology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=244–50 |year=1995 |pmid=7854520 |doi=10.1212/WNL.45.2.244|s2cid=25800388 }}</ref>

== Society and culture ==
In [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'', the main character, Esther Summerville, has a transient episode of visual loss, the symptoms of which are also seen in people who have optic neuritis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/01658107.2013.830313 |pmid=28167994 |pmc=5291069 |author=Petzold A |title=Optic Neuritis: Another Dickensian Diagnosis |journal=Neuro-Ophthalmology |volume=37 |issue=6 |year=2013 |pages=247–250}}</ref> Legal historian [[William Searle Holdsworth]] suggested that the events in ''Bleak House'' took place in 1827.

In an episode of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' ("Season of Miracles", season five), Reverend Timothy Johnson is struck blind by optic neuritis on Christmas Day 1872. He remains blind for the duration of the series.
