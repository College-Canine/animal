A '''pleural effusion''' is accumulation of excessive fluid in the [[pleural space]], the [[potential space]] that surrounds each [[lung]].
Under normal conditions, [[pleural fluid]] is secreted by the [[parietal pleura]]l capillaries at a rate of 0.6 millilitre per kilogram weight per hour, and is cleared by [[lymphatic]] absorption leaving behind only 5–15 millilitres of fluid, which helps to maintain a functional [[vacuum]] between the parietal and [[visceral pleura]]e.  Excess fluid within the pleural space can impair [[inhalation|inspiration]] by upsetting the functional vacuum and [[hydrostatic]]ally increasing the resistance against lung expansion, resulting in a fully or partially [[collapsed lung]].

Various kinds of fluid can accumulate in the pleural space, such as [[serous fluid]] ([[hydrothorax]]), [[blood]] ([[hemothorax]]), [[pus]] ([[pyothorax]], more commonly known as [[pleural empyema]]), [[chyle]] ([[chylothorax]]), or very rarely [[urine]] ([[urinothorax]]).  When unspecified, the term "pleural effusion" normally refers to hydrothorax.  A pleural effusion can also be compounded by a [[pneumothorax]] (accumulation of [[air]] in the pleural space), leading to a [[hydropneumothorax]].

==Types==
Various methods can be used to classify pleural fluid.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000086.htm

By the origin of the fluid:
* [[Serous fluid]] ([[hydrothorax]])
* [[Blood]] ([[haemothorax]])
* [[Chyle]] ([[chylothorax]])
* [[Pus]] ([[pyothorax]] or [[empyema]])
* [[Urine]] ([[urinothorax]])

By pathophysiology:
* Transudative pleural effusion
* Exudative pleural effusion

By the underlying cause (see next section).

== Causes ==
[[File:Blausen 0993 PleuralEffusion.png|thumb|Pleural effusion]]

=== Transudative ===
The most common causes of [[transudative]] pleural effusion in the United States are [[heart failure]] and [[cirrhosis]]. [[Nephrotic syndrome]], leading to the loss of large amounts of [[albumin]] in urine and resultant [[hypoalbuminemia|low albumin]] levels in the blood and reduced colloid osmotic pressure, is another less common cause of pleural effusion. [[Pulmonary emboli]] were once thought to cause transudative effusions, but have been recently shown to be exudative.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Porcel JM, Light RW | title = Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism | journal = Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–42 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18520269 | doi = 10.1097/MCP.0b013e3282fcea3c | s2cid = 44337698 }}</ref>
The mechanism for the exudative pleural effusion in pulmonary thromboembolism is probably related to increased permeability of the [[capillaries]] in the lung, which results from the release of [[cytokines]] or inflammatory mediators (e.g. [[vascular endothelial growth factor]]) from the [[platelet]]-rich [[thrombus|blood clots]]. The excessive interstitial lung fluid traverses the [[visceral pleura]] and accumulates in the [[pleural space]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Conditions associated with transudative pleural effusions include:<ref name="ReferenceA">Galagan et al. Color Atlas of Body Fluids. CAP Press, Northfield, 2006</ref>
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* Liver [[cirrhosis]]
* Severe hypoalbuminemia
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]]
* Acute atelectasis<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/atelectasis/ | title= Atelectasis | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 2 July 2021}}</ref>

=== Exudative ===
[[File:Pleural effusion.jpg|thumb|'''Pleural effusion''' Anteroposterior Chest X-ray of a pleural effusion. The A arrow shows fluid layering in the right pleural cavity. The B arrow shows the normal width of the lung in the cavity]]

When a pleural effusion has been determined to be [[exudate|exudative]], additional evaluation is needed to determine its cause, and [[amylase]], [[glucose]], [[pH]] and cell counts should be measured.
* Red blood cell counts are elevated in cases of bloody effusions (for example after heart surgery or hemothorax from incomplete evacuation of blood).
* Amylase levels are elevated in cases of [[esophageal rupture]], [[Pancreatic fistula|pancreatic pleural effusion]], or [[cancer]].
* Glucose is decreased with cancer, bacterial infections, or [[rheumatoid pleuritis]].
* pH is low in [[empyema]] (<7.2) and maybe low in cancer.
* If cancer is suspected, the pleural fluid is sent for [[cytology]]. If cytology is negative, and cancer is still suspected, either a [[thoracoscopy]], or needle biopsy<ref>{{cite journal | author = de Menezes Lyra R | title = A modified outer cannula can help thoracentesis after pleural biopsy | journal = Chest | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 296 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9228404 | doi = 10.1378/chest.112.1.296 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/content/112/1/296.2.full.pdf }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> of the pleura may be performed.
* [[Gram staining]] and culture should also be done.
* If [[tuberculosis]] is possible, examination for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (either a [[Ziehl–Neelsen stain|Ziehl–Neelsen]] or [[Kinyoun stain]], and mycobacterial cultures) should be done. A [[polymerase chain reaction]] for tuberculous DNA may be done, or [[adenosine deaminase]] or [[interferon gamma]] levels may also be checked.

The most common causes of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial [[pneumonia]], cancer (with [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[lymphoma]] causing approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions), viral infection, and [[pulmonary embolism]].

Another common cause is after heart surgery when incompletely drained blood can lead to an inflammatory response that causes exudative pleural fluid.

Conditions associated with exudative pleural effusions:<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
* [[Parapneumonic effusion]] due to [[pneumonia]]
* Malignancy (either lung cancer or metastases to the pleura from elsewhere)
* Infection (empyema due to bacterial pneumonia)

* [[Pulmonary embolism]]
* Autoimmune disorders
* [[Pancreatitis]]
* Ruptured esophagus ([[Boerhaave's syndrome]])
* Rheumatoid [[pleurisy]]
* Drug-induced [[drug-induced lupus erythematosus|lupus]]

=== Other/ungrouped ===
Other causes of pleural effusion include [[tuberculosis]] (though stains of pleural fluid are only rarely positive for [[acid-fast]] bacilli, this is the most common cause of pleural effusions in some developing countries), [[autoimmune]] disease such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], bleeding (often due to chest trauma), [[chylothorax]] (most commonly caused by trauma), and accidental infusion of fluids.<ref name="arztebl.2019.0377">{{cite journal |last1= Jany |first1= B |last2= Welte |first2= T |date= May 2019 | title= Pleural Effusion in Adults—Etiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment | journal= Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | volume= 116 |issue= 21 |pages= 377–386 |doi= 10.3238/arztebl.2019.0377 | pmid= 31315808 |pmc= 6647819 }}</ref> Less common causes include esophageal rupture or pancreatic disease, intra-abdominal abscesses, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], asbestos pleural effusion, [[mesothelioma]], [[Meigs's syndrome]] (ascites and pleural effusion due to a benign [[ovarian tumor]]), and [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].<ref name="arztebl.2019.0377"/>

==Pathophysiology==
Pleural fluid is secreted by the parietal layer of the [[pleura]] and reabsorbed by the lymphatics in the most dependent parts of the parietal pleura, primarily the diaphragmatic and mediastinal regions. Exudative pleural effusions occur when the pleura is damaged, e.g., by trauma, infection, or malignancy, and transudative pleural effusions develop when there is either excessive production of pleural fluid or the resorption capacity is reduced.

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Effusionhalf.PNG|right|thumb|A large left-sided pleural effusion as seen on an upright chest X-ray]]
A pleural effusion is usually diagnosed on the basis of [[medical history]] and [[physical exam]], and confirmed by a [[chest X-ray]]. Once accumulated fluid is more than 300 mL, there are usually detectable [[clinical sign]]s, such as decreased movement of the chest on the affected side, dullness to percussion over the fluid, diminished [[breath sounds]] on the affected side, decreased vocal resonance and [[fremitus]] (though this is an inconsistent and unreliable sign), and [[pleural friction rub]]. Above the effusion, where the lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing sounds and [[egophony]]. A large effusion there may cause [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] deviation away from the effusion. A systematic review (2009) published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] showed that dullness to conventional percussion was most accurate for diagnosing pleural effusion (summary positive [[Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]], 8.7; 95% [[confidence interval]], 2.2–33.8), while the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus made pleural effusion less likely (negative likelihood ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.37).<ref name=Wong09>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong CL, Holroyd-Leduc J, Straus SE | title = Does this patient have a pleural effusion? | journal = JAMA | volume = 301 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–17 | date = Jan 2009 | pmid = 19155458 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2008.937 }}</ref>

=== Imaging ===
A pleural effusion appears as an area of whiteness on a standard posteroanterior chest X-ray.<ref>{{cite book |author=Corne|title = Chest X-Ray Made Easy|publisher = Churchill Livingstone|year = 2002|isbn = 0-443-07008-3|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Normally, the space between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura cannot be seen. A pleural effusion infiltrates the space between these layers. Because the pleural effusion has a density similar to water, it can be seen on radiographs. Since the effusion has greater density than the rest of the lung, it gravitates towards the lower portions of the [[pleural cavity]]. The pleural effusion behaves according to basic fluid dynamics, conforming to the shape of pleural space, which is determined by the lung and chest wall. If the pleural space contains both air and fluid, then an air-fluid level that is horizontal will be present, instead of conforming to the lung space.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Squire, Lucy Frank |author2=Novelline, Robert A. |title=Squire's fundamentals of radiology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/squiresfundament0000nove/page/132 132–3] |isbn=0-674-01279-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/squiresfundament0000nove/page/132 }}</ref> Chest radiographs in the lateral [[decubitus]] position (with the patient lying on the side of the pleural effusion) are more sensitive and can detect as little as 50 mL of fluid. Between 250 and 600mL of fluid must be present before upright chest X-rays can detect a pleural effusion (e.g., blunted [[costophrenic angle]]s).<ref name="radiopaedia">{{cite web |url = https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pleural-effusion?lang=gb|title = Pleural effusion |vauthors = Bell DJ, Jones J |website = Radiopaedia  |access-date=July 20, 2021 }}</ref>

Chest [[CT scan|computed tomography]] is more accurate for diagnosis and may be obtained to better characterize the presence, size, and characteristics of a pleural effusion.  Lung [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasound]], nearly as accurate as CT and more accurate than chest X-ray, is increasingly being used at the point of care to diagnose pleural effusions, with the advantage that it is a safe, dynamic, and repeatable imaging modality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Volpicelli|first1=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577–591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031|doi-access=free}}</ref> To increase diagnostic accuracy of detection of pleural effusion sonographically, markers such as boomerang and VIP signs can be utilized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=James Siu Ki|last2=Yuen|first2=Chi Kit|last3=Mok|first3=Ka Leung|last4=Yan|first4=Wing Wa|last5=Kan|first5=Pui Gay|date=2017-11-15|title=Visualization of the inferoposterior thoracic wall (VIP) and boomerang signs-novel sonographic signs of right pleural effusion|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=36|issue=7|pages=1134–1138|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2017.11.023|issn=1532-8171|pmid=29162443|s2cid=41876899}}</ref>

=== Thoracentesis ===
Once a pleural effusion is diagnosed, its cause must be determined. Pleural fluid is drawn out of the pleural space in a process called [[thoracentesis]], and it should be done in almost all patients who have pleural fluid that is at least 10&nbsp;mm in thickness on CT, ultrasonography, or lateral decubitus X-ray and that is new or of uncertain etiology. In general, the only patients who do not require thoracentesis are those who have [[heart failure]] with symmetric pleural effusions and no chest pain or fever; in these patients, [[Diuretic|diuresis]] can be tried, and thoracentesis is avoided unless effusions persist for more than 3 days.<ref name=merckm>{{cite web|last=Light|first=Richard W.|title=Pleural Effusion|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pulmonary_disorders/mediastinal_and_pleural_disorders/pleural_effusion.html|work=Merck Manual for Health Care Professionals|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.|access-date=21 August 2013}}</ref> In a thoracentesis, a needle is inserted through the back of the chest wall in the sixth, seventh, or eighth intercostal space on the midaxillary line, into the pleural space.

{{Transudate vs. exudate}}

Definitions of the terms "[[transudate]]" and "[[exudate]]" are the source of much confusion. Briefly, transudate is produced through pressure filtration without capillary injury while exudate is "inflammatory fluid" leaking between cells.<ref name="0003-4819-77-4-507">{{cite journal |vauthors= Light RW, Macgregor MI, Luchsinger PC, Ball WC Jr|date= October 1972 |title=Pleural effusions: the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates. |url= https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4642731/|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=507–13 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-77-4-507 |pmid= 4642731  |access-date= 20 July 2021}}</ref>

Transudative pleural effusions are defined as effusions that are caused by ''systemic'' factors that alter the pleural equilibrium, or [[Starling equation|Starling forces]]. The components of the Starling forces – hydrostatic pressure, permeability, and oncotic pressure (effective pressure due to the composition of the pleural fluid and blood) – are altered in many diseases, e.g., [[heart failure|left ventricular failure]], kidney failure, liver failure, and [[cirrhosis]]. Exudative pleural effusions, by contrast, are caused by alterations in ''local'' factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e.g., [[bacterial pneumonia]], [[cancer]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and viral infection).<ref>{{cite book |author=Light, Richard W. |chapter=Ch. 257: Disorders of the Pleura and Mediastinum |veditors=Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo J |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |edition=17th}}</ref>

An accurate diagnosis of the cause of the effusion, transudate versus exudate, relies on a comparison of the chemistries in the pleural fluid to those in the blood, using Light's criteria. According to Light's criteria (Light, et al. 1972), a pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the following exists:<ref name="Lights">{{cite journal |vauthors=Light RW, Macgregor MI, Luchsinger PC, Ball WC | title = Pleural effusions: the diagnostic separation of transudates and exudates | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 507–13 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4642731 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-77-4-507 | s2cid = 31947040 }}</ref>

Therefore, if a patient identified by Light's criteria as having an exudative pleural effusion appears clinically to have a condition that usually produces transudative effusions, additional testing is needed. In such cases, [[serum albumin|albumin]] levels in blood and pleural fluid are measured. If the difference between the albumin level in the blood and the pleural fluid is greater than 1.2 g/dL (12 g/L), this suggests that the patient has a transudative pleural effusion.<ref name="pmid2152757"/> However, pleural fluid testing is not perfect, and the final decision about whether a fluid is a transudate or an exudate is based not on chemical analysis of the fluid, but an accurate diagnosis of the disease that produces the fluid.<ref name="0003-4819-77-4-507"/>
The traditional definitions of transudate as a pleural effusion due to systemic factors and an exudate as a pleural effusion due to local factors have been used since 1940 or earlier (Light et al., 1972). Previous to Light's landmark study, which was based on work by Chandrasekhar, investigators unsuccessfully attempted to use other criteria, such as specific gravity, pH, and protein content of the fluid, to differentiate between transudates and exudates. Light's criteria are highly statistically sensitive for exudates (although not very statistically specific). More recent studies have examined other characteristics of pleural fluid that may help to determine whether the process producing the effusion is local (exudate) or systemic (transudate). The table above illustrates some of the results of these more recent studies. However, it should be borne in mind that Light's criteria are still the most widely used criteria.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The Rational Clinical Examination Series review found that bilateral effusions, symmetric and asymmetric, are the most common distribution in heart failure (60% of effusions in heart failure will be bilateral). When there is asymmetry in heart failure-associated pleural effusions (either unilateral or one side larger than the other), the right side is usually more involved than the left.<ref name=Wong09 />
The instruments pictured are accurately shaped, however, most hospitals now use safer disposable [[trocar]]s. Because these are single use, they are always sharp and have a much smaller risk of cross patient contamination.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

== Treatment ==

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pleural effusion.

Therapeutic aspiration may be sufficient; larger effusions may require insertion of an [[Chest tube|intercostal drain]] (either pigtail or surgical). When managing these chest tubes, it is important to make sure the chest tubes do not become occluded or clogged. A clogged chest tube in the setting of continued production of fluid will result in residual fluid left behind when the chest tube is removed. This fluid can lead to complications such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] due to [[lung collapse]] from the fluid, or [[fibrothorax]] if scarring occurs. Repeated effusions may require chemical ([[talc]], [[bleomycin]], [[tetracycline]]/[[doxycycline]]), or surgical [[pleurodesis]], in which the two pleural surfaces are scarred to each other so that no fluid can accumulate between them. This is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a chest tube, then either mechanically abrading the pleura or inserting the chemicals to induce a scar. This requires the chest tube to stay in until the fluid drainage stops. This can take days to weeks and can require prolonged hospitalizations. If the chest tube becomes clogged, fluid will be left behind and the [[pleurodesis]] will fail.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Pleurodesis fails in as many as 30% of cases. An alternative is to place a PleurX Pleural Catheter or Aspira Drainage Catheter. This is a 15Fr chest tube with a one-way valve. Each day the patient or caregivers connect it to a simple vacuum tube and remove from 600 to 1000 mL of fluid, and can be repeated daily. When not in use, the tube is capped. This allows patients to be outside the hospital. For patients with [[malignant pleural effusion]]s, it allows them to continue chemotherapy if indicated. Generally, the tube is in for about 30 days, and then it is removed when space undergoes spontaneous pleurodesis.

Tubercular pleural effusion is one of the common extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. Treatment consists of antituberculosis treatment (ATT). The currently recommended ATT regime is two months of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide followed by four months of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol.<ref>{{cite book |last1=World Health Organisation |title=Consolidated Guidelines on Tuberculosis Treatment.
