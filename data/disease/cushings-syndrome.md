Symptoms include rapid [[obesity|weight gain]], particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs ([[central obesity]]). Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the [[clavicle|collarbone]], on the back of the neck ("buffalo hump" or [[lipodystrophy]]), and on the face ("[[moon face]]"). Other symptoms include [[hyperhidrosis|excess sweating]], [[telangiectasia|dilation of capillaries]], thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and mucous membranes, purple or red [[Stretch marks|striae]] (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs, or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and [[hirsutism]] (facial male-pattern hair growth), [[baldness]] and/or extremely dry and brittle hair. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause [[hypocalcemia]]. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, [[insomnia]], inhibited [[aromatase]], reduced [[libido]], [[impotence]] in men, and [[amenorrhoea]], [[oligomenorrhea]] and [[infertility]] in women due to elevations in [[androgens]]. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of [[GnRH]] release.<ref name="pmid9745407">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lado-Abeal J, Rodriguez-Arnao J, Newell-Price JD, Perry LA, Grossman AB, Besser GM, Trainer PJ | title = Menstrual abnormalities in women with Cushing's disease are correlated with hypercortisolemia rather than raised circulating androgen levels | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 83 | issue = 9 | pages = 3083–3088 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9745407 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.83.9.5084 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Other signs include [[polyuria|increased urination]] (and accompanying [[polydipsia|increased thirst]]), persistent [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] (due to cortisol's enhancement of [[epinephrine]]'s vasoconstrictive effect) and [[insulin resistance]] (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] and insulin resistance which can lead to [[diabetes mellitus]].  Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as [[acanthosis nigricans]] in the [[axilla]] and around the neck, as well as [[skin tag]]s in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to [[heart disease]] and increased [[death|mortality]]. Cortisol can also exhibit [[mineralocorticoid]] activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to [[hypokalemia]] (common in ectopic ACTH secretion) and [[hypernatremia]] (increased Na+ ions concentration in plasma). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol's suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. [[Osteoporosis]] is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

=== Hyperpigmentation ===

Cushing's syndrome due to excess [[ACTH]] may also result in [[hyperpigmentation]]. This is due to [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Alternatively, it is proposed that the high levels of ACTH, [[β-lipotropin]], and [[lipotropin|γ-lipotropin]], which contain weak MSH function, can act on the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]]. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic, i.e. extra pituitary, ACTH production from, for example, a small-cell lung cancer.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/cushings-syndrome/| title=Cushing's Syndrome
|website=The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 11 July 2021}}</ref>

When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol at the level of the adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), negative feedback ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. In these cases, ACTH levels remain low and no hyperpigmentation develops.<ref name="auto"/>

Cushing's disease is a specific type of Cushing's syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor leading to excessive production of [[ACTH]] (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Excessive ACTH stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to produce high levels of cortisol, producing the disease state.

===Exogenous===
The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is the use of prescribed [[glucocorticoid]]s to treat other diseases ([[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] Cushing's syndrome). Glucocorticoids are used in treatment of a variety of disorders, including [[asthma]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and also used for [[immunosuppression]] after organ transplants. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Rarely, Cushing's syndrome can also be due to the use of [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]].<ref name="pmid2552887">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siminoski K, Goss P, Drucker DJ | title = The Cushing syndrome induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 111 | issue = 9 | pages = 758–760 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2552887 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-111-9-758 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Merrin PK, Alexander WD | title = Cushing's syndrome induced by medroxyprogesterone | journal = BMJ | volume = 301 | issue = 6747 | pages = 345 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2144198 | pmc = 1663616 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.301.6747.345-a }}</ref> In exogenous Cushing's, the adrenal glands may often gradually atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, the production of which is suppressed by glucocorticoid medication. Abruptly stopping the medication can thus result in acute and potentially life-threatening [[adrenal insufficiency]] and the dose must hence be slowly and carefully tapered off to allow internal cortisol production to pick up.

=== Endogenous ===
[[Endogeny|Endogenous]] Cushing's syndrome results from some derangement of the body's own system of cortisol secretion. Normally, [[ACTH]] is released from the [[pituitary gland]] when necessary to stimulate the release of cortisol from the [[adrenal gland]]s.{{cn|date=October 2021}}
* In pituitary Cushing's, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as [[Cushing's disease]] and is responsible for 70% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome.<ref name="endocrine.niddk">[http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/cushings/cushings.htm#1 Cushing's Syndrome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410084418/http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/cushings/cushings.htm |date=2011-04-10 }} at The National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service.

* In adrenal Cushing's, excess cortisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.
* Tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH (occasionally with CRH) that affects the adrenal glands. This etiology is called ectopic or [[paraneoplasia|paraneoplastic]] Cushing's disease and is seen in diseases such as [[small cell carcinoma|small cell]] [[lung cancer]].<ref name="pmid3525603">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schteingart DE, Lloyd RV, Akil H, Chandler WF, Ibarra-Perez G, Rosen SG, Ogletree R | title = Cushing's syndrome secondary to ectopic corticotropin-releasing hormone-adrenocorticotropin secretion | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 770–775 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3525603 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-3-770 }}</ref>

===Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome===
Elevated levels of total cortisol can also be due to estrogen found in oral contraceptive pills that contain a mixture of estrogen and progesterone, leading to [[pseudo-Cushing's syndrome]]. Estrogen can cause an increase of [[transcortin|cortisol-binding globulin]] and thereby cause the total cortisol level to be elevated. However, the total free cortisol, which is the active hormone in the body, as measured by a 24-hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol, is normal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Katz J | title = Motive to sin | journal = Nature | volume = 359 | issue = 6398 | pages = 769 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1436049 | pmc = 1436049 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.s1-3.1.11 | bibcode = 1992Natur.359..769K }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The [[hypothalamus]] is in the brain and the [[pituitary gland]] sits just below it. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropin ([[ACTH]]).  ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal gland, where it stimulates the release of [[cortisol]]. Cortisol is secreted by the cortex of the [[adrenal gland]] from a region called the [[zona fasciculata]] in response to ACTH. Elevated levels of cortisol exert [[negative feedback]] on CRH in the hypothalamus, which decreases the amount of ACTH released from the anterior pituitary gland.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Strictly, Cushing's syndrome refers to excess cortisol of any etiology (as [[syndrome]] means a group of symptoms). One of the causes of Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol-secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland (primary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

[[Cushing's disease]] refers only to hypercortisolism secondary to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph [[pituitary adenoma]] (secondary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH ([[Corticotropin releasing hormone]]) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). This causes the blood ACTH levels to be elevated along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because the tumor is unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

When Cushing's syndrome is due to extra [[ACTH]] it is known as ectopic Cushing syndrome.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001443/ Ectopic Cushing syndrome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002064759/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001443/ |date=2013-10-02 }} at A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia, PubMedHealth, National Institute of Health</ref> This may be seen in a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]].

When Cushing's syndrome is suspected, either a [[dexamethasone suppression test]] (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offers equal detection rates.<ref name="pmid12809455">{{cite journal | vauthors = Raff H, Findling JW | title = A physiologic approach to diagnosis of the Cushing syndrome | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 138 | issue = 12 | pages = 980–991 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12809455 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-138-12-200306170-00010 | s2cid = 14930007 }}</ref> Dexamethasone is a [[glucocorticoid]] and simulates the effects of cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50 nmol/L (1.81&nbsp;μg/dL) would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in [[saliva]] over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late-night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may need to be ascertained.  Performing a [[physical examination]] to determine any [[visual field]] defect may be necessary if a pituitary lesion is suspected, which may compress the [[optic chiasm]], causing typical [[bitemporal hemianopia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

When any of these tests is positive, [[CT scan]]ning of the adrenal gland and [[MRI]] of the [[pituitary gland]] are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary adenomas or [[incidentaloma]]s (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). [[Scintigraphy]] of the adrenal gland with [[iodocholesterol]] scan is occasionally necessary. Occasionally, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary ([[Inferior petrosal sinus|petrosal sinus]] sampling) is necessary. In many cases, the tumors causing Cushing's disease are less than 2&nbsp;mm in size and difficult to detect using MRI or CT imaging. In one study of 261 patients with confirmed pituitary Cushing's disease, only 48% of pituitary lesions were identified using MRI prior to surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jagannathan J, Smith R, DeVroom HL, Vortmeyer AO, Stratakis CA, Nieman LK, Oldfield EH | title = Outcome of using the histological pseudocapsule as a surgical capsule in Cushing disease | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 531–539 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19267526 | pmc = 2945523 | doi = 10.3171/2008.8.JNS08339 }}</ref>

Plasma CRH levels are inadequate at diagnosis (with the possible exception of tumors secreting CRH) because of peripheral dilution and binding to [[CRHBP]].<ref>{{cite book| veditors = Blevins LS |title=Cushing's syndrome|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-4020-7131-7|page=115}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Most cases of Cushingoid symptoms are caused by corticosteroid medications, such as those used for asthma, arthritis, eczema and other inflammatory conditions.  Consequently, most patients are effectively treated by carefully tapering off (and eventually stopping) the medication that causes the symptoms.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

If an adrenal adenoma is identified, it may be removed by surgery. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic [[pituitary adenoma]] should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim, as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with [[hydrocortisone]] or [[prednisolone]] is imperative.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In those patients not suited for or unwilling to undergo surgery, several drugs have been found to inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. [[ketoconazole]], [[metyrapone]]) but they are of limited efficacy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Mifepristone]] is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostasis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing's syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belanoff JK, Flores BH, Kalezhan M, Sund B, Schatzberg AF | title = Rapid reversal of psychotic depression using mifepristone | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 516–521 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11593077 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-200110000-00009 | s2cid = 3067889 }}</ref> However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an [[abortifacient]].
