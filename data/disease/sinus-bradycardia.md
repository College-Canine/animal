'''Sinus bradycardia''' is a [[sinus rhythm]] with a reduced rate of electrical discharge from the [[sinoatrial node]], resulting in a [[bradycardia]], a [[heart rate]] that is lower than the normal range (60–100 beats per minute for adult humans).<ref name = "Hafeez_2020">{{cite book |last1=Hafeez |first1=Yamama |last2=Grossman |first2=Shamai A. | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Sinus Bradycardia |date=2020|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493201/|title = StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29630253|access-date=2020-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sinus Bradycardia |url=https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/s/sinus-bradycardia.html |access-date=2020-07-28|website=Cedars-Sinai|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The decreased heart rate can cause a decreased cardiac output resulting in symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], [[dizziness]], [[hypotension]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bradycardia - Signs and Symptoms {{!}} CardioSmart – American College of Cardiology |url=http://www.cardiosmart.org/topics/bradycardia/signs-and-symptoms |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=CardioSmart |language=en}}</ref>  The slow heart rate may also lead to [[atrial]], junctional, or [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] ectopic rhythms.

Bradycardia is not necessarily problematic. People who practice sports may have sinus bradycardia, because their trained hearts can pump enough blood in each contraction to allow a low [[resting heart rate]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2023}} Sinus bradycardia can also be an adaptive advantage; for example, diving [[earless seal|seals]] may have a heart rate as low as 12 beats per minute, helping them to conserve oxygen during long dives.<ref name="pmid15233163">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thornton SJ, Hochachka PW | title = Oxygen and the diving seal | journal = Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–95 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15233163 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284190141 }}</ref>

Sinus bradycardia is a common condition found in both healthy individuals and those who are considered well-conditioned athletes.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Salyer SW | chapter = Chapter 2 - Cardiology | veditors = Salyer SW |title=Essential emergency medicine: for the healthcare practitioner |date=2007 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4160-2971-7 |pages=37–96  }}</ref>

Heart rates considered bradycardic vary by species; for example, in the house cat, a rate of under 120 beats per minute is abnormal. Generally, smaller species have higher and larger species lower rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Milani-Nejad N, Janssen PM | title = Small and large animal models in cardiac contraction research: advantages and disadvantages | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 141 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–49 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24140081 | pmc = 3947198 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.10.007 }}</ref>

== Pathophysiology & etiology ==

[[Image:Sinus bradycardia lead2.svg|thumb|Rhythm strip of sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm]]
* Sinus bradycardia is commonly seen in normal healthy persons and athletes in the absence of pathophysiological diseases or conditions.<ref name = "Hafeez_2020"/>
* Different factors or etiologies could lead to the dysfunction of the sinus node, causing a malformation or prolongation of the impulse.
* In terms of pathophysiological diseases, sinus rhythm may be caused by:
** Diseases/Conditions:
*** [[Acute myocardial infarction]], [[carotid sinus syndrome]], eating disorders (such as [[anorexia nervosa]]), [[Grayanotoxin|rhodotoxin]] poisoning, [[hypothermia]], [[hypothyroidism]], infections (such as [[diphtheria]], acute [[rheumatic fever]], or viral [[myocarditis]]), intrinsic disease of the [[SA node]] (such as [[sick sinus syndrome]]), [[Roemheld syndrome]], [[sleep apnea]]
** Physiological causes:
*** Increased [[Vagal Tone|vagal tone]], increased [[intracranial pressure]]
** Medications, most commonly: [[Digitalis|digitalis glycosides]], [[beta-blockers]], [[quinidine]], [[adenosine]], [[calcium channel blockers]], [[Antiarrhythmic agent|class I antiarrhythmic agents]], [[ivabradine]], [[clonidine]], [[reserpine]], [[cimetidine]], lithium, [[amitriptyline]]

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of sinus bradycardia can be confirmed by an electrocardiogram that shows the following characteristics:<ref name = "Hafeez_2020"/>
* Rate:  Less than 60 beats per minute.
* Rhythm:  Regular.
* [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P waves]]:  Upright, consistent, and normal in morphology and duration.
* [[PR interval]]:  Between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds in duration.
* [[QRS complex]]:  Less than 0.12 seconds in width, and consistent in morphology.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Electrocardiogram Waves |url=https://en.my-ekg.com/basic-principles/waves-electrocardiogram.html |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=en.my-ekg.com |language=en}}</ref>
Taking a thorough medical history and physical exam by healthcare providers can also help with narrowing differential diagnosis. Any recent changes to patient's medication history, new symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations, family history of sinus bradycardia, physical exam that reveals cyanosis, peripheral edema, altered mental status, dyspnea, rales and crackles are all relevant information to consider for differential diagnosis.<ref name = "Hafeez_2020"/>
