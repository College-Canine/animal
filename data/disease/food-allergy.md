<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
A '''food allergy''' is an abnormal [[immune system|immune response]] to [[food]]. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include [[pruritus|itchiness]], swelling of the tongue, [[vomiting]], diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name=NIH2012pdf/> A [[food intolerance]] and [[food poisoning]] are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.<ref name=NIH2012pdf/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyce JA, Assa'ad A, Burks AW, Jones SM, Sampson HA, Wood RA, Plaut M, Cooper SF, Fenton MJ, Arshad SH, Bahna SL, Beck LA, Byrd-Bredbenner C, Camargo CA, Eichenfield L, Furuta GT, Hanifin JM, Jones C, Kraft M, Levy BD, Lieberman P, Luccioli S, McCall KM, Schneider LC, Simon RA, Simons FE, Teach SJ, Yawn BP, Schwaninger JM | display-authors = 6 | title = Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States: Summary of the NIAID-Sponsored Expert Panel Report | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 1105–1118 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21134568 | pmc = 4241958 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.10.008 }}</ref>

Food allergy symptoms occur within minutes to hours after exposure and may include:<ref name=medlineplus>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000817|Food allergy}}</ref>
* [[Rash]]
* [[Hives]]<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Itching of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Swelling ([[angioedema]]) of lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Difficulty swallowing<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Runny or congested nose<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Hoarse voice<ref name=medlineplus/>
* [[Wheezing]] and/or shortness of breath<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or stomach cramps<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Lightheadedness<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Fainting<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Nausea<ref name=medlineplus/>
* Vomiting<ref name=medlineplus/>

In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours.<ref name=medlineplus/>

Symptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simons FE, Ardusso LR, Bilò MB, El-Gamal YM, Ledford DK, Ring J, Sanchez-Borges M, Senna GE, Sheikh A, Thong BY | display-authors = 6 | title = World allergy organization guidelines for the assessment and management of anaphylaxis | journal = The World Allergy Organization Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 13–37 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 23268454 | pmc = 3500036 | doi = 10.1097/WOX.0b013e318211496c }}</ref>

Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and [[cyanosis]]. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak [[pulse]], pale skin and [[fainting]].<ref>van Ree 1</ref>

A severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called [[anaphylaxis]].  When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in [[anaphylactic shock]]. Anaphylaxis occurs when [[IgE antibodies]] are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=12}}</ref> Those with [[asthma]] or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.

==Pathophysiology==
[[image:Histamin - Histamine.svg|thumb|Histamine, the structure shown, causes a person to feel itchy during an allergic reaction.]]
<!-- A food allergy occurs when the human immune system reacts abnormally to certain foods.<ref name=nhs>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/Pages/Intro1.aspx |quote=A food allergy is when the body's immune system reacts unusually to specific foods |access-date=31 January 2017 |title=Food allergy |publisher=[[NHS Choices]] |date=16 May 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131050131/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/pages/intro1.aspx |archive-date=31 January 2017 }}</ref>
 -->
Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:<ref name=nhs>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/Pages/Intro1.aspx |quote=A food allergy is when the body's immune system reacts unusually to specific foods |access-date=31 January 2017 |title=Food allergy |publisher=[[NHS Choices]] |date=16 May 2016}}</ref>

# IgE-mediated (classic)&nbsp;– the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve [[anaphylaxis]].
# Non-IgE mediated&nbsp;– characterized by an immune response not involving [[immunoglobulin E]]; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis
# IgE and/or non-IgE-mediated&nbsp;– a hybrid of the above two types

[[Allergic reactions]] are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign [[pathogen]]s. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.<ref>Food Reactions. [http://www.foodreactions.org/allergy/ Allergies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416042849/http://www.foodreactions.org/allergy/ |date=2010-04-16 }}. Foodreactions.org.  Kent, England. 2005. Accessed 27 Apr 2010.</ref>

Hypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur.  The four types of [[hypersensitivity reaction]] are:  type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated; and type 4, delayed cell-mediated.<ref>{{harvnb|Nester|2009|p=414}}</ref> The [[pathophysiology]] of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an [[Acute (medical)|acute response]] that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a "late-phase reaction" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Many food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods.  Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.<ref>Mayo Clinic.

===Acute response===
[[Image:Allergy degranulation processes 01.svg|thumb|Degranulation process in allergy:<br />'''1''' — antigen<br />'''2''' — IgE antibody<br />'''3''' — FcεRI receptor<br />'''4''' — preformed mediators (histamine, proteases, chemokines, heparin)<br />'''5''' — [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]]<br />'''6''' — [[mast cell]]<br />'''7''' — newly formed mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, PAF)]]
In the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a [[T helper cell|T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocyte]], which belongs to a subset of [[T cell]]s that produce a [[cytokine]] called [[interleukin-4]] (IL-4).  These T<sub>H</sub>2 cells interact with other [[lymphocytes]] called [[B cell]]s, whose role is the production of antibodies.  Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE.  Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of [[Fc receptor]] called [[FcεRI]]) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil]]s, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response.  The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | vauthors = Janeway C, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik M | author-link = Charles Janeway | title = Immunobiology; Fifth Edition | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2001 | location = New York and London | pages = e–book | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 | isbn = 978-0-8153-4101-7 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090628195820/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 | archive-date = 2009-06-28 }}</ref>

If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils.  Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell.  Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called [[degranulation]], during which they release [[histamine]] and other inflammatory chemical mediators ([[cytokine]]s, [[interleukin]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, and [[prostaglandin]]s) from their [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as [[vasodilation]], [[Mucous membrane|mucous]] secretion, [[nerve]] stimulation, and [[smooth muscle|smooth-muscle]] contraction. This results in [[rhinorrhea]], itchiness, [[dyspnea]], and [[anaphylaxis]]. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems.<ref name=Janeway/>

===Late-phase response===
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other [[leukocyte]]s such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and [[macrophage]]s to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grimbaldeston MA, Metz M, Yu M, Tsai M, Galli SJ | title = Effector and potential immunoregulatory roles of mast cells in IgE-associated acquired immune responses | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–760 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17011762 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2006.09.011 }}</ref> Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holt PG, Sly PD | title = Th2 cytokines in the asthma late-phase response | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9596 | pages = 1396–1398 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17950849 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61587-6 | s2cid = 40819814 }}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Allergy skin testing.JPG|thumb|Skin testing on the arm is a common way for detecting an allergy, but it is not as effective as other tests.]]
[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]
Diagnosis is usually based on a [[medical history]], [[elimination diet]], [[skin prick test]], blood tests for food-specific IgE [[antibodies]], or [[oral food challenge]].<ref name=NIH2012pdf/><ref name=Sic2014/>
* For [[skin prick test|skin-prick test]]s, a tiny board with protruding needles is used.  The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin.  The board is then placed on the skin, to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person is considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies.  Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin-prick tests.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=185}}</ref>

Skin-prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a "[[bifurcated needle]]", which looks like a fork with two prongs. Others use a "multitest", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient's history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.
* [[Patch test]]ing is used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed food reactions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apfed.org/drupal/drupal/allergies_and_EoE |title=Allergies and EGIDs &#124; American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders |publisher=Apfed.org |access-date=2014-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132527/http://apfed.org/drupal/drupal/allergies_and_EoE |archive-date=4 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elsevier.pt/en/revistas/allergologia-et-immunopathologia-105/artigo/patch-test-in-the-diagnosis-of-food-allergy-13142485 |title=Patch test in the diagnosis of food allergy |date=2014-03-22 |access-date=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310034619/http://www.elsevier.pt/en/revistas/allergologia-et-immunopathologia-105/artigo/patch-test-in-the-diagnosis-of-food-allergy-13142485 |archive-date=2014-03-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rokaite R, Labanauskas L, Vaideliene L | title = Role of the skin patch test in diagnosing food allergy in children with atopic dermatitis | journal = Medicina | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 1081–1087 | date = 2014-01-24 | pmid = 15547309 }}</ref>
* [[Blood test]]ing is another way to test for allergies; however, it poses the same disadvantage and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen.  [[RAST test|Radioallergosorbent testing]] (RAST) is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|pp=187–8}}</ref>

A CAP-RAST has greater specificity than RAST; it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen.<ref>

The recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests. Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include [[endoscopy]], [[colonoscopy]], and [[biopsy]].{{medical citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Differential diagnosis===
Important [[Differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] are:
* [[Lactose intolerance]] generally develops later in life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It is not an immune reaction and is due to an enzyme deficiency ([[lactase]]). It is more common in many non-Western people.
* [[Celiac disease]]. While it is caused by a permanent intolerance to [[gluten]] (present in [[wheat]], rye, barley and oats), is not an allergy nor simply an intolerance, but a chronic, [[systemic disease|multiple-organ]] [[autoimmune disorder]] primarily affecting the [[small intestine]].<ref name=NIH2015>{{cite web|title=Celiac Disease|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/Pages/facts.aspx|website=NIDDKD|access-date=17 March 2016|date=June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313222154/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/Pages/facts.aspx|archive-date=13 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=WGO2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines/celiac-disease/celiac-disease-english|title=Celiac disease|date=July 2016|publisher=[[World Gastroenterology Organisation]] Global Guidelines|access-date=23 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317123604/http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines/celiac-disease/celiac-disease-english|archive-date=17 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="TommasiniNot2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tommasini A, Not T, Ventura A | title = Ages of celiac disease: from changing environment to improved diagnostics | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 17 | issue = 32 | pages = 3665–3671 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21990947 | pmc = 3181451 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v17.i32.3665 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]
* C1 Esterase inhibitor deficiency ([[hereditary angioedema]]), a [[rare disease]], generally causes attacks of angioedema, but can present solely with [[abdominal pain]] and occasional diarrhea, and thus may be confused with allergy-triggered angioedema.

To avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted.  In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, [[blood transfusion]]s, cosmetics, and alcohol.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|pp=151–8}}</ref>

Early introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Introducing Foods and Allergy Prevention |url=https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/fast-facts/introducing-foods-and-allergy-prevention#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20introducing%20common%20allergy%20causing%20foods,nuts,%20soy,%20sesame,%20wheat,%20fish%20and%20other%20seafood. |access-date=2023-01-01 |website=- Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA)}}</ref>

===Inhalation exposure===
Allergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes. According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis.<ref name=Leonardi2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leonardi S, Pecoraro R, Filippelli M, Miraglia del Giudice M, Marseglia G, Salpietro C, Arrigo T, Stringari G, Ricò S, La Rosa M, Caffarelli C | display-authors = 6 | title = Allergic reactions to foods by inhalation in children | journal = Allergy and Asthma Proceedings | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 288–294 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24992548 | doi = 10.2500/aap.2014.35.3755 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = James JM, Crespo JF | title = Allergic reactions to foods by inhalation | journal = Current Allergy and Asthma Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–174 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17448326 | doi = 10.1007/s11882-007-0017-z | s2cid = 11974562 }}</ref> The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow's milk.<ref name=Leonardi2014 /> Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.<ref name=Leonardi2014 /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vitaliti G, Pavone P, Spataro G, Giunta L, Guglielmo F, Falsaperla R | title = Legumes steam allergy in childhood: Update of the reported cases | journal = Allergologia et Immunopathologia | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 196–202 | year = 2015 | pmid = 24411097 | doi = 10.1016/j.aller.2013.09.009 }}</ref> One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.<ref name=Leonardi2014 />

== Treatment ==

The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens.  An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see [[#Regulation of labelling|regulation of labelling]]).

If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction ([[anaphylaxis]]) occurs, then [[epinephrine]] should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions.  The person should then be transported to the [[emergency room]], where additional treatment can be given.  Other treatments include [[antihistamine]]s and [[steroid]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Food Allergy and Anaphalaxis Public Declaration|url=http://infoallergy.com/Tools-Extras/foodallergycampaign/EuropeanFoodAllergyAnaphylaxisPublicDeclaration/|publisher=the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)|access-date=10 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215033212/http://infoallergy.com/Tools-Extras/foodallergycampaign/EuropeanFoodAllergyAnaphylaxisPublicDeclaration/|archive-date=15 December 2013}}</ref>

===Epinephrine===
[[File:epipen.jpg|thumb|Epinephrine autoinjectors are portable single-dose epinephrine-dispensing devices used to treat anaphylaxis.]]
[[Epinephrine (medication)|Epinephrine]] (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects. Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs.  Epinephrine is available by prescription in an [[auto-injector|autoinjector]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=133}}</ref>

===Antihistamines===
Antihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=131}}</ref>  Antihistamines block the action of [[histamine]], which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals.  The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is [[diphenhydramine]].

===Steroids===
[[Glucocorticoid|Glucocorticoid steroids]] are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction.  This treatment in the form of a [[nasal spray]] should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact.  Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation.  Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Sicherer|2006|p=134}}</ref>

=== Immunotherapy ===
[[Immunotherapies]] seek to condition the immune system to elicit or suppress a specific immune response. In the treatment of allergies, common immunotherapies seek to desensitize the immune system by gradually exposing the body to allergens in increasing amounts. These forms of immunotherapy have had varying and limited success and have generally been used to treat peanut and environmental allergies.<ref>{{Citation |last=Persaud |first=Y|last2=Memon |first2=RJ |last3=Savliwala |first3=MN |title=Allergy Immunotherapy |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535367/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-12-22 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30570988}}</ref>

===Regulation of labelling===
[[File:US Allergen Information Example.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|An example of a list of allergens in a food item]]
In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.

The priority allergens vary by country.

====Ingredients intentionally added====
In the United States, the [[Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2004 requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat.<ref name=FDA2004 /> The eight-ingredient list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission.<ref name=Allen2014 /> To meet labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its "food sourced name" in parentheses, for example, "Casein (milk)," or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: "Contains milk" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling).<ref name=FDA2004 /><ref name=FDAreadlabel2017>{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Have Food Allergies?

In 2018, the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-fdas-new-consideration-labeling-sesame-allergies |title=Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on the FDA's new consideration of labeling for sesame allergies |date= 29 October 2018 |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> A decision was reached in November 2020 that food manufacturers voluntarily declare that when powdered sesame seeds are used as a previously unspecified spice or flavor, the label be changed to "spice (sesame)" or "flavor (sesame)."<ref name=Sesame2020>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-issues-draft-guidance-industry-voluntary-disclosure-sesame-when-added-flavoring-or-spice |title=FDA Issues Draft Guidance for Industry on Voluntary Disclosure of Sesame When Added as Flavoring or Spice |date= 10 November 2020 |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |access-date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

Congress and the President passed a law in April 2021, the "FASTER Act", stipulating that labeling be mandatory, to be effect January 1, 2023, making it the ninth required food ingredient label.<ref name=SesameLaw2021>{{cite web |url= https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/578/text |title= Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research Act of 2021 or the FASTER Act of 2021|date=4 April 2021 |website=Congress.gov|access-date=5 March 2022}}</ref>

The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages.<ref name=FDAallergies2017 /> However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]], which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like "Contains: milk", are mandatory.<ref name="FSIS2017" /><ref name="FSIS2016" />  The act also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants.<ref name="pmid24505841">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roses JB | title = Food allergen law and the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004: falling short of true protection for food allergy sufferers | journal = Food and Drug Law Journal | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–42, ii | year = 2011 | pmid = 24505841 }}</ref><ref name="FDAFALCPAquestions">{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Food Allergen Labeling And Consumer Protection Act of 2004 Questions and Answers |website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm106890.htm |date=18 July 2006|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref> The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 – requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide |title=Allergy and intolerance: guidance for businesses |access-date=2014-12-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208003515/https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide |archive-date=2014-12-08 }}</ref>

====Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination====
The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.).<ref name=Allen2014 /><ref name=FDAallergies2017>{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Food Allergies: What You Need to Know |website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm079311.htm |date=18 December 2017|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref> Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.<ref name=Mills2004>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills EN, Valovirta E, Madsen C, Taylor SL, Vieths S, Anklam E, Baumgartner S, Koch P, Crevel RW, Frewer L | display-authors = 6 | title = Information provision for allergic consumers--where are we going with food allergen labelling? | journal = Allergy | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1262–1268 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15507093 | doi = 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2004.00720.x | s2cid = 40395908 }}</ref><ref name=Taylor2015>{{cite book |vauthors=Taylor SL, Baumert JL |title=Food Allergy: Molecular Basis and Clinical Practice |chapter=Worldwide food allergy labeling and detection of allergens in processed foods |journal=Chem Immunol Allergy |volume=101 |pages=227–234 |year=2015 |pmid=26022883 |doi=10.1159/000373910 |series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy |isbn=978-3-318-02340-4 }}</ref>

South Africa does not permit the use of precautionary allergen labeling, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice.<ref name=Allen2014 /> In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that precautionary allergen labeling be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified "the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population" as the threshold reference dose for certain foods (such as cow's milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) to provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond "may contain."<ref name=Allen2014B>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen KJ, Remington BC, Baumert JL, Crevel RW, Houben GF, Brooke-Taylor S, Kruizinga AG, Taylor SL | display-authors = 6 | title = Allergen reference doses for precautionary labeling (VITAL 2.0): clinical implications | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 156–164 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23987796 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2013.06.042 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SL, Baumert JL, Kruizinga AG, Remington BC, Crevel RW, Brooke-Taylor S, Allen KJ, Houben G | display-authors = 6 | title = Establishment of Reference Doses for residues of allergenic foods: report of the VITAL Expert Panel | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 63 | pages = 9–17 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24184597 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.032 }}</ref> VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.<ref>[http://allergenbureau.net/vital/ The VITAL Program] Allergen Bureau, Australia and New Zealand.</ref> The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Popping B, Diaz-Amigo C | title = European Regulations for Labeling Requirements for Food Allergens and Substances Causing Intolerances: History and Future | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–7 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29202901 | doi = 10.5740/jaoacint.17-0381 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, [[cashew nut]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[pecan nut]]s, [[pistachio]]s, [[pine nut]]s, and [[chestnut]]s.<ref name="ANVISA2016"/>

One concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction.<ref name="Selb2017" /> Of the food currently{{when|date=September 2019}} in widespread use of genetically modified organisms, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen. However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the genetically modified varieties.<ref name="Dunn2017" /> Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.<ref name=Lee2017/>

Prior to a new genetically modified food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion - a trait shared by many allergenic proteins?<ref name="Dunn2017" /> Genes approved for animal use can be restricted from human consumption due to potential for allergic reactions. In 1998 Starlink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated [[StarLink corn recall|recall]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bucchini L, Goldman LR | title = Starlink corn: a risk analysis | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–13 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11781159 | pmc = 1240687 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.021105 }}</ref> There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (similar to the requirements in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).<ref name="Lee2017" />

=== Restaurants ===
In the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy
reactions. Restaurant staff, including wait staff and kitchen staff, may not be adequately informed about allergenic ingredients, or the risk of cross-contact when kitchen utensils used to prepare food may have been in previous contact with an allergenic food. The problem may be compounded when customers have a hard time describing their food allergies or when wait staff have a hard time understanding those with food allergies when taking an order.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wen H, Kwon J |title=Food Allergy Risk Communication in Restaurants |journal=Food Protection Trends |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=372–383 |year=2016 |url=http://www.foodprotection.org/files/food-protection-trends/sep-oct-16-wen.pdf }}</ref>

=== Diagnosing issues ===
There exists both over-reporting and under-reporting of the prevalence of food allergies. Self-diagnosed perceptions of food allergy are greater than the rates of true food allergy because people confuse non-allergic intolerance with allergy, and also attribute non-allergy symptoms to an allergic response. Conversely, healthcare professionals treating allergic reactions on an out-patient or even hospitalized basis may not report all cases. Recent increases in reported cases may reflect a real change in incidence or an increased awareness on the part of healthcare professionals.<ref name=":8">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hadley C | title = Food allergies on the rise?

Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life.<ref name=Lange2014/><ref name=Velde2013/> For children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by the actions of their peers. An increased occurrence of [[bullying]] has been observed, which can include threats or deliberate acts of forcing allergic children to contact foods that they must avoid or intentional contamination of allergen-free food.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fong AT, Katelaris CH, Wainstein B | title = Bullying and quality of life in children and adolescents with food allergy | journal = Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | pages = 630–635 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28608485 | doi = 10.1111/jpc.13570 | s2cid = 9719096 }}</ref> The social impacts of food allergies can carry over into adulthood.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-12-23 |title=The Social Impact of Food Allergies |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/living-with-food-allergies_b_4480918 |access-date=2023-01-01 |website=HuffPost |language=en}}</ref>

==Portrayal in media==
Media portrayals of food allergy in television and film are not accurate, often used for comedic effect or underplaying the potential severity of an allergic reaction.<ref name="Abo2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abo MM, Slater MD, Jain P | title = Using Health Conditions for Laughs and Health Policy Support: The Case of Food Allergies | journal = Health Communication | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 803–811 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 27436408 | doi = 10.1080/10410236.2016.1172292 | s2cid = 3858223 }}</ref> These [[trope (cinema)|tropes]] misinform the public and also contribute to how entertainment media will continue to wrongly portray food allergies in the future. Types of tropes: 1) characters have food allergies, providing a weakness that can be used to sabotage them. In the movie [[Parasite (2019 film)|''Parasite'']] a housekeeper is displaced by taking advantage of her peach allergy.<ref name=FARE /> In the animated film [[Peter Rabbit (film)|''Peter Rabbit'']], the farm owner is attacked by being pelted with blackberries, causing an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency treatment with epinephrine. After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the ''Peter Rabbit'' director apologized for making light of food allergies.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/peter-rabbit-food-allergy.html Sony Apologizes for 'Peter Rabbit' Movie's Allergy Scene] New York Times, Jacey Fortrin, Feb 12, 2018.</ref> 2) Food allergy is used for comedic effect, such as in the movies [[Hitch (film)|''Hitch'']] and in television, Kelso's egg allergy in ''[[That '70s Show]]'' 3) Food allergies may be incorporated into characters who are also portrayed as annoying, weak and oversensitive, which can be taken as implying that their allergies are either not real or not potentially severe. In season 1, episode 16 of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)|''The Big Bang Theory'']] Howard Wolowitz deliberately consumes a peanut-containing food bar (and has a serious reaction) just to delay Leonard from returning to his apartment where a surprise birthday party is being arranged. 4) Any of these portrayals may underplay the potential severity of food allergy, some showing that [[Benadryl]] treatment is sufficient.<ref name=FARE>{{cite web |url=https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/how-media-portrays-food-allergies |title=How the Media Portrays Food Allergies |date= |website=Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) |access-date=12 September 2022}}</ref> Viewing of humorous portrayals of food allergies has been shown to have a negative effect on related health policy support due to low perceived seriousness.<ref name="Abo2017"/>

==Research==
Several theories have been suggested to explain why certain individuals develop allergic sensitization instead of oral tolerance to food allergens. One such theory is the dual allergen hypothesis, which states that ingesting food allergens early on promotes oral tolerance while skin exposure leads to sensitization.<ref name=":9"/> Instead of oral ingestion, skin barrier disruption in conditions like eczema, for instance, was suggested to cause allergic sensitization in animal and human infants.<ref name="auto"/> Inhalation was recently proposed to be an additional sensitization route in the dual allergen hypothesis.<ref name=":7"/> Another theory is the barrier regulation hypothesis, describing the role of [[Commensalism|commensal bacteria]] in preventing the development of food allergy by maintaining integrity of the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal epithelial barrier]].<ref name=":9" /> Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as early life nutrition and antibiotic treatment, may contribute to food allergy prevalence by affecting gut microbial composition, and thus, intestinal immune homeostasis in infants and young children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesemann DR, Nagler CR | title = The Microbiome, Timing, and Barrier Function in the Context of Allergic Disease | journal = Immunity | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 728–738 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27096316 | pmc = 4869964 | doi = 10.1016/j.immuni.2016.02.002 }}</ref>

A number of desensitization techniques are being studied.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nowak-Węgrzyn A, Sampson HA | title = Future therapies for food allergies | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 558–73; quiz 574–5 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21277625 | pmc = 3066474 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.12.1098 }}</ref> Areas of research include specific oral tolerance induction (also known as [[oral immunotherapy]]), and [[sublingual immunotherapy]]. The benefits of [[allergen immunotherapy]] for food allergies is unclear, thus is not recommended {{as of|2015|lc=yes}}.<ref name="NIH2015Imm" />

There is research on the effects of increasing intake of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s during pregnancy, lactation, via infant formula and in early childhood on the subsequent risk of developing food allergies during infancy and childhood. From two reviews, maternal intake of [[omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3, long-chain fatty acids]] during pregnancy appeared to reduce the risks of medically diagnosed IgE-mediated allergy, eczema and food allergy per parental reporting in the first 12 months of life,<ref name=Best2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Best KP, Gold M, Kennedy D, Martin J, Makrides M | title = Omega-3 long-chain PUFA intake during pregnancy and allergic disease outcomes in the offspring: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 103 | issue = 1 | pages = 128–143 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26675770 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.115.111104 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Gunaratne2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunaratne AW, Makrides M, Collins CT | title = Maternal prenatal and/or postnatal n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation for preventing allergies in early childhood | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2015 | issue = 7 | pages = CD010085 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26197477 | pmc = 8783748 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2 }}</ref> but the effects were not all sustained past 12 months.<ref name=Gunaratne2015 /> The reviews characterized the literature's evidence as inconsistent and limited.<ref name=Best2016 /><ref name=Gunaratne2015 /> Results when breastfeeding mothers were consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids were inconclusive.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waidyatillake NT, Dharmage SC, Allen KJ, Lodge CJ, Simpson JA, Bowatte G, Abramson MJ, Lowe AJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Association of breast milk fatty acids with allergic disease outcomes-A systematic review | journal = Allergy | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 295–312 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28869762 | doi = 10.1111/all.13300 | doi-access = free }}</ref> For infants, supplementing their diet with oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids did not affect the risks of food allergies, eczema or asthma either as infants or into childhood.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler T, Sinn JK, Osborn DA | title = Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in infancy for the prevention of allergy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2016 | issue = 10 | pages = CD010112 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27788565 | pmc = 6464137 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010112.pub2 }}</ref>

There is research on [[probiotic]]s, [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]]s and the combination of the two ([[synbiotics]]) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies.
