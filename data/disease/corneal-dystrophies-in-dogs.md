'''Corneal dystrophies''' are a group of diseases that affect the [[cornea]] in dogs.<ref name="Esson 2015">{{cite book|last1=Esson|first1=DW|title=Clinical Atlas of Canine and Feline Ophthalmic Disease|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118841044|page=114|chapter=Chapter 54: Corneal dystrophy}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Corneal dystrophy in dogs usually does not cause any problems and treatment is not required.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sapienza | first = John S. | title = Corneal Diseases of Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 27th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2647 | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}</ref>
Suboptimal vision caused by corneal dystrophy usually requires surgical intervention in the form of [[corneal transplantation]]. [[Penetrating keratoplasty]] is commonly performed for extensive corneal dystrophy.

==Corneal endothelial dystrophy==
Corneal endothelial dystrophy is an age-related change that affects the inner layer of the corneal, the [[Corneal endothelium|endothelium]].  Leakage of fluid into the cornea causes [[edema]], causing a bluish appearance.  This will eventually involve the whole cornea.  [[Bullous keratopathy]] ([[blister]]s in the cornea) may also form, leading to nonhealing and recurrent corneal ulceration.  [[Hyperosmotic]] agents are sometimes used topically for treatment, but success with these medications is inconsistent and can cause irritation.  Bad cases may require a [[corneal transplant]] or [[thermokeratoplasty]], which is a grid of superficial burns to the cornea that causes anterior stromal fibers to contract and prevent fluid uptake by the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Michau T, Gilger B, Maggio F, Davidson M |title=Use of thermokeratoplasty for treatment of ulcerative keratitis and bullous keratopathy secondary to corneal endothelial disease in dogs: 13 cases (1994–2001) |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=222 |issue=5 |pages=607–12 |year=2003 |pmid=12619840 |doi=10.2460/javma.2003.222.607|doi-access=free }}</ref>  The most commonly affected breeds are the [[Boston Terrier]], [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], and [[Dachshund]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999/>  The age of onset in the Boston is five to nine years and eight to thirteen years in the Chihuahua and Dachshund.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bjerk | first = Ellen | title = Ocular Disease of the Aging Dog | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8721&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}</ref>  The disease is similar to [[Fuchs' dystrophy]] in humans.

==Commonly affected breeds==
Many breeds are affected by corneal dystrophy with many different appearances.  These breeds most commonly have these criteria.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|editor=Gelatt, Kirk N.|title=Veterinary Ophthalmology|edition=3rd|publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=0-683-30076-8}}</ref>
