'''Glomerulonephritis''' ('''GN''') is a term used to refer to several [[kidney]] diseases (usually affecting both kidneys).  Many of the diseases are characterised by [[inflammation]] either of the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]] or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys, hence the name,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000045097|glomerulonephritis}}</ref> but not all diseases necessarily have an inflammatory component.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

As it is not strictly a single disease, its presentation depends on the specific disease entity: it may present with isolated [[hematuria]] and/or [[proteinuria]] (blood or protein in the [[urine]]); or as a [[nephrotic syndrome]], a [[nephritic syndrome]], [[acute kidney injury]], or [[chronic kidney disease]].

They are categorized into several different pathological patterns, which are broadly grouped into non-proliferative or proliferative types. Diagnosing the pattern of GN is important because the outcome and treatment differ in different types. Primary causes are intrinsic to the kidney. Secondary causes are associated with certain infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens), drugs, systemic disorders ([[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]], vasculitis), or diabetes.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Gray1130.svg|thumb|left|A [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]], a functional unit that represents the first step in the filtration of [[blood]] and generation of [[urine]].]]

Glomerulonephritis refers to an inflammation of the [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerulus]], which is the unit involved in filtration in the kidney. This inflammation typically results in one or both of the [[nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]] or [[nephritic syndrome]]s.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|500}}

===Nephrotic syndrome===
<!-- please do not move GN subtypes here, as they may result in mixed presentations -->
{{Main|Nephrotic syndrome}}
The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of [[edema]] in a person with [[proteinuria|increased protein in the urine]] and [[hypoalbuminemia|decreased protein in the blood]], with [[hyperlipidemia|increased fat in the blood]]. Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus, [[podocyte]]s, increases the permeability to [[protein]]s, resulting in an increase in excreted proteins. When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver's ability to compensate, fewer proteins are detected in the blood – in particular [[albumin]], which makes up the majority of circulating proteins. With decreased proteins in the blood, there is a decrease in the [[oncotic pressure]] of the blood. This results in edema, as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same. Although decreased intravascular oncotic (i.e. osmotic) pressure partially explains the patient's edema, more recent studies have shown that extensive sodium retention in the distal nephron (collecting duct) is the predominant cause of water retention and edema in the nephrotic syndrome.<ref>The Nephrotic Syndrome

[[Hyperlipidemia]] is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|549}}

===Nephritic syndrome===
[[File:Filtration barrier.svg|thumb|right|[[Podocyte]]s, cells which line the glomerulus, are negatively charged and have small gaps, preventing the filtration of large molecules. When damaged by [[inflammation]], this can result in an increased permeability to [[protein]]s]]
{{Main|Nephritic syndrome}}
The nephritic syndrome is characterised by [[haematuria|blood in the urine]] (especially [[Urinary cast|Red blood cell casts]] with dysmorphic red blood cells) and a [[oligouria|decrease in the amount of urine]] in the presence of [[hypertension]]. In this syndrome, inflammatory damage to cells lining the glomerulus are thought to result in destruction of the [[epithelium|epithelial]] barrier, leading to blood being found in the urine. At the same time, reactive changes, e.g. proliferation of mesangial cells,{{which|date=November 2013}} may result in a decrease in kidney blood flow, resulting in a decrease in the production of urine. The [[renin–angiotensin system]] may be subsequently activated, because of the decrease in perfusion of [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]], which may result in hypertension.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|554}}

==Nonproliferative==
This is characterised by forms of glomerulonephritis in which the number of cells is not changed. These forms usually result in the [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Causes include:

===Minimal change disease===
{{Main|Minimal change disease}}
[[Minimal change disease]] is characterised as a cause of [[nephrotic syndrome]] without visible changes in the glomerulus on microscopy. Minimal change disease typically presents with  [[edema]], an [[proteinuria|increase in proteins passed from urine]] and decrease in blood protein levels, and an increase in circulating [[lipid]]s (i.e., [[nephrotic syndrome]]) and is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children. Although no changes may be visible by light microscopy, changes on [[electron microscopy]] within the glomeruli may show a fusion of the foot processes of the [[podocyte]]s (cells lining the basement membrane of the capillaries of glomerulus). It is typically managed with [[corticosteroid]]s and does not progress to [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|500}}<ref name=ROBBINS2007/>{{rp|550}}

===Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis===
{{Main|Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis}}

[[Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] is characterised by a [[fibrosis|sclerosis]] of segments of some glomeruli. It is likely to present as a nephrotic syndrome. This form of glomerulonephritis may be associated with conditions such as [[HIV]] and [[heroin]] abuse, or inherited as [[Alport syndrome]]. The cause of about 20–30% of focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown. On microscopy, affected glomeruli may show an increase in [[hyalin]], a pink and homogeneous material, [[lipid|fat cells]], an increase in the mesangial matrix and collagen. Treatment may involve [[corticosteroid]]s, but up to half of people with focal segmental glomerulonephritis continue to have progressive deterioration of kidney function, ending in kidney failure.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|550–551}}

===Membranous glomerulonephritis===
{{Main|Membranous glomerulonephritis}}

[[Membranous glomerulonephritis]] may cause either [[nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]] or a [[nephritic syndrome|nephritic]] picture. About two-thirds are associated with auto-antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor, but other associations include [[cancer]]s of the lung and bowel, infections such as [[hepatitis B]] and [[malaria]], drugs including [[penicillamine]], and connective tissue diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. Individuals with [[cerebral shunt]]s are at risk of developing [[shunt nephritis]], which frequently produces MGN.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Microscopically, MGN is characterized by a thickened [[glomerular basement membrane]] without a hyperproliferation of the glomerular cells. [[Immunofluorescence]] demonstrates diffuse granular uptake of [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]]. The basement membrane may completely surround the granular deposits, forming a "spike and dome" pattern. Tubules also display the symptoms of a typical Type III hypersensitivity reaction, which causes the endothelial cells to proliferate, which can be seen under a light microscope with a PAS stain.<ref>{{MedlinePlus|000472|Membranous nephropathy}}</ref>

Prognosis follows the rule of thirds: one-third remain with MGN indefinitely, one-third remit, and one-third progress to [[end-stage kidney failure]]. As the glomerulonephritis progresses, the tubules of the kidney become infected, leading to atrophy and hyalinisation. The kidney appears to shrink. Treatment with [[corticosteroid]]s is attempted if the disease progresses.{{cn|date=November 2023}}

In extremely rare cases, the disease has been known to run in families, usually passed down through the females. This condition, similarly, is called Familial Membranous Glomerulonephritis. There have only been about nine documented cases in the world.

===Thin basement membrane disease===
{{Main|Thin basement membrane disease}}
[[Thin basement membrane disease]] is an [[autosomal]] dominant inherited disease characterized by thin glomerular basement membranes on electron microscopy. It is a benign condition that causes persistent microscopic [[hematuria]]. This also may cause proteinuria which is usually mild and overall prognosis is excellent. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Fibronectin glomerulopathy===

Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare form of glomerulopathy characterised by enlarged glomeruli with deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial space. The deposits have been shown to be fibronectin. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. About 40% of cases are due to mutations in the fibronectin ([[FN1]]) gene located on [[chromosome 2]] (2q34).

==Proliferative==
Proliferative glomerulonephritis is characterised by an increased number of cells in the glomerulus. These forms usually present with a triad of [[haematuria|blood in the urine]], [[oliguria|decreased urine production]], and [[hypertension]], the [[nephritic syndrome]]. These forms usually progress to [[end-stage kidney failure]] (ESKF) over weeks to years (depending on type).

===IgA nephropathy===
{{Main|IgA nephropathy}}

[[IgA nephropathy]], also known as ''Berger's disease'', is the most common type of glomerulonephritis, and generally presents with isolated visible or occult hematuria, occasionally combined with low grade proteinuria, and rarely causes a [[nephritic syndrome]] characterised by [[proteinuria]], and visible [[hematuria|blood in the urine]]. IgA nephropathy is classically described as a self-resolving form in young adults several days after a respiratory infection. It is characterised by deposits of [[IgA]] in the [[mesangium|space between glomerular capillaries]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|501}}<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|554–555}}

[[Henoch–Schönlein purpura]] refers to a form of IgA nephropathy, typically affecting children, characterised by a rash of [[petechiae|small bruises]] affecting the buttocks and lower legs, with abdominal pain.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|501}}

===Post-infectious===
{{Main|Post-infectious glomerulonephritis}}

[[Post-infectious glomerulonephritis]] can occur after essentially any infection, but classically occurs after infection with the bacteria ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''. It typically occurs 1–4 weeks after a [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] infection with this bacterium, and is likely to present with malaise, a slight [[fever]], [[nausea]] and a mild [[nephritic syndrome]] of moderately increased blood pressure, gross haematuria, and smoky-brown urine. Circulating [[immune complex]]es that deposit in the glomeruli may lead to an inflammatory reaction.<ref name=ROBBINS2007>{{cite book|editor-first=Vinay |editor-last=Kumar|title=Robbins basic pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1|edition=8th}}</ref> {{rp|554–555}}

Diagnosis may be made on clinical findings or through [[antistreptolysin O]] antibodies found in the blood. A biopsy is seldom done, and the disease is likely to self-resolve in children in 1–4 weeks, with a poorer prognosis if adults are affected or if the affected children are obese.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010>{{cite book|editor-first=Nicki R. |editor-last=Colledge |editor-first2=Brian R. |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first3=Stuart H. |editor-last3=Ralston |others=illust.

===Membranoproliferative===
{{Main|Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis}}
Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), also known as ''mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis,''<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />{{rp|502}} is characterised by an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus, and alterations in the glomerular [[basement membrane]]. These forms present with the [[nephritic syndrome]], [[hypocomplementemia]], and have a poor prognosis. Three subtypes have been proposed:<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|552–553}}
* Type 1 MPGN is caused by immune complex deposition in the mesangium and subendothelial space, typically secondary to [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C|C]], or other chronic or recurring infections. Circulating immune complexes may activate the [[complement system]], leading to inflammation and an influx of inflammatory cells.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|552–553}}
* Type 2 MPGN, also known as ''Dense Deposit Disease'', is characterised by an excessive activation of the complement system. The C3 Nephritic Factor [[autoantibody]] stabilizes [[C3-convertase]], which may lead to an excessive activation of complement.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|553}} Type 2 MPGN is a subgroup of C3 glomerulopathy, a newly proposed diagnosis which also encompasses C3 Glomerulonephritis (C3GN).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tzoumas|first1=Nikolaos|last2=Hallam|first2=Dean|last3=Harris|first3=Claire L.|last4=Lako|first4=Majlinda|last5=Kavanagh|first5=David|last6=Steel|first6=David H.W.|date=November 2020|title=Revisiting the role of factor H in age-related macular degeneration: Insights from complement-mediated renal disease and rare genetic variants|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.survophthal.2020.10.008|journal=Survey of Ophthalmology|volume=66|issue=2|pages=378–401|doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2020.10.008|pmid=33157112|s2cid=226274874|issn=0039-6257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=What is C3 Glomerulopathy?|url=https://www.atypicalhus.co.uk/c3g/what-is-c3-glomerulopathy/|access-date=2021-02-04|website=National Renal Complement Therapeutics Centre|language=en-GB}}</ref>
* Type 3 MPGN, which is caused by immune complex deposition in the subepithelial space.

===Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis===
{{Main|Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis}}

[[Image:Crescentic glomerulonephritis Periodic acid silver methanamine stain.JPEG|thumb|Photomicrograph of [[renal biopsy]] showing crescent formation and tuft narrowing. [[Periodic acid silver methenamine stain]].]]
[[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]], also known as ''crescentic GN'', is characterised by a rapid, progressive deterioration in kidney function. People with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may present with a [[nephritic syndrome]]. In management, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes used, although the prognosis remains poor.<ref name=COUSER1999 /> Three main subtypes are recognised:<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|557–558}}
* Type 1 is [[Goodpasture syndrome]], an [[autoimmune disease]] also affecting the [[lung]]. In Goodpasture syndrome, [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] antibodies directed against the glomerular [[basement membrane]]  trigger an inflammatory reaction, causing a [[nephritic syndrome]] and [[haemoptysis|the coughing up of blood]].<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|557}} High dose immunosuppression is required (intravenous [[methylprednisolone]]) and cyclophosphamide, plus plasmapheresis. Immunohistochemistry staining of tissue specimens shows linear IgG deposits.
* Type 2 is characterised by immune-complex-mediated damage, and may be associated with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], post-infective glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and [[Henoch–Schönlein purpura|IgA vasculitis]].<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|558}}
* Type 3 rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also called ''pauciimmune type'', is associated with causes of [[vasculitides|vascular inflammation]] including [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (GPA) and [[microscopic polyangiitis]]. No immune deposits can be seen on staining, however blood tests may be positive for the [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|ANCA]] antibody.<ref name=ROBBINS2007 />{{rp|558–559}}

Histopathologically, the majority of glomeruli present "crescents". Formation of crescents is initiated by passage of fibrin into the Bowman space as a result of increased permeability of glomerular basement membrane. Fibrin stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells of Bowman capsule, and an influx of monocytes. Rapid growing and fibrosis of crescents compresses the capillary loops and decreases the Bowman space, which leads to kidney failure within weeks or months. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Some forms of glomerulonephritis are diagnosed clinically, based on findings on history and examination. Other tests may include:<ref name=COUSER1999>{{cite journal|last=COUSER|first=W|title=Glomerulonephritis|journal=The Lancet|date=1 May 1999|volume=353|issue=9163|pages=1509–1515|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)06195-9|pmid=10232333|s2cid=208793555}}</ref>
* Urine examination
* Blood tests investigating the cause, including [[complete blood count|FBC]], [[inflammatory marker]]s, and special tests (including [[Anti-streptolysin O|ASLO]], [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|ANCA]], [[Anti-GBM]], [[Complement system|Complement]] levels, [[Anti-nuclear antibody|Anti-nuclear antibodies]])
* [[Biopsy]] of the kidney
* [[Renal ultrasonography]] is useful for prognostic purposes in finding signs of [[chronic kidney disease]], which however may be caused by many other diseases than glomerulonephritis.<ref name=Hansen2015/>

==Treatment==
Antibiotic therapy to prevent streptococcal infection (prophylaxis). Steroids to suppress inflammation. Provide high calories & low protein, sodium & potassium diet. Monitor for sign of kidney failure, heart failure, and hypertensive encephalopathy.
