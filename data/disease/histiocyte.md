A '''histiocyte''' is a vertebrate   [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that is part of the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] (also known as the reticuloendothelial system or lymphoreticular system). The mononuclear phagocytic system is part of the organism's [[immune system]]. The histiocyte is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[macrophage]]<ref name="Cline1994">{{cite journal |last1=Cline |first1=Mj |title=Histiocytes and histiocytosis|journal=Blood |date=1 November 1994 |volume=84 |issue=9 |pages=2840–2853 |doi=10.1182/blood.V84.9.2840.2840 |doi-access=free }}</ref> or a [[dendritic cell]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chorro L, Geissmann F | title = Development and homeostasis of 'resident' myeloid cells: the case of the Langerhans cell | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 438–45 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21030305 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2010.09.003 }}</ref> ('''histio''', diminutive of '''histo''', meaning ''tissue'', and '''cyte''', meaning ''cell''). Part of their job is to clear out [[neutrophil]]s once they've reached the end of their lifespan. 

==Development==
Histiocytes are derived from the [[bone marrow]] by multiplication from a [[stem cell]].  The derived cells migrate from the bone marrow to the [[blood]] as [[monocytes]]. They circulate through the body and enter various organs, where they undergo differentiation into histiocytes, which are part of the [[mononuclear phagocytic system]] (MPS).

However, the term ''histiocyte'' has been used for multiple purposes in the past, and some cells called "histocytes" do not appear to derive from monocytic-macrophage lines.<ref name="urlS12C3-Granuloma">{{cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/InflamDermato/S12C3Granuloma/s12c3granuloma.htm |title=S12C3-Granuloma |access-date=2009-01-06}}</ref> The term Histiocyte can also simply refer to a cell from monocyte origin outside the blood system, such as in a tissue (as in rheumatoid arthritis as palisading histiocytes surrounding fibrinoid necrosis of rheumatoid nodules).

Some sources consider [[Langerhans cell]] derivatives to be histiocytes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cline MJ | title = Histiocytes and histiocytosis | journal = Blood | volume = 84 | issue = 9 | pages = 2840–53 | date = November 1994 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V84.9.2840.2840 | pmid = 7524755 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] embeds this interpretation into its name.

== Structure ==
Histiocytes have common [[histology|histological]] and immunophenotypical characteristics (demonstrated by [[immunostaining|immunostains]]).  Their [[cytoplasm]] is [[eosinophilic]] and contains variable amounts of [[lysosome]]s.  They bear membrane receptors for [[opsonin]]s, such as [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] and the fragment C3b of complement.  They express LCAs ([[leucocyte common antigen]]s) [[CD45]], [[CD14]], [[CD33]], and [[CD4]] (also expressed by [[T helper cell]]s).

===Macrophages and dendritic cells===
These histiocytes are part of the immune system by way of two distinct functions: [[phagocytosis]] and [[antigen presentation]]. Phagocytosis is the main process of [[macrophage]]s and [[antigen]] presentation the main property of [[dendritic cell]]s (so called because of their star-like cytoplasmic processes).

[[Macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s are derived from common bone marrow precursor cells that have undergone different differentiation (as histiocytes) under the influence of various environmental (tissue location) and growth factors such as GM-CSF, [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] and IL-4. The various categories of histiocytes are distinguishable by their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[phenotype]], and size.
* Macrophages are highly variable in size and morphology, their [[cytoplasm]] contains numerous [[acid phosphatase]] laden [[lysosomes]] – in relation to their specialised phagocytic function.  They express [[CD68]].
* Dendritic cells have an indented (bean-shaped) nucleus and cytoplasm with thin processes (dendritic).  Their main activity is antigen presentation; they express [[Factor XIII]]a, [[CD1]]c, and Class II [[Human leukocyte antigen]]s.

===Langerhans cells===
A subset of cells differentiates into [[Langerhans cells]]; this maturation occurs in the [[squamous epithelium]], [[lymph nodes]], [[spleen]], and [[bronchiolar epithelium]].  Langerhans cells are antigen-presenting cells but have undergone further differentiation.  Skin Langerhans cells express CD1a, as do cortical [[thymocytes]] (cells of the cortex of the [[thymus]] gland).  They also express S-100, and their cytoplasm contains tennis-racket like ultra-structural inclusions called [[Birbeck granules]].

==Clinical significance==
[[Histiocytosis|Histiocytoses]] describe [[neoplasias]] wherein the proliferative cell is the histiocyte. The most common histiocyte disorders are [[Langerhans' cell histiocytosis]] and [[haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]].<ref name="pmid9039734">{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb DK | title = Histiocyte disorders | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 818–25 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 9039734 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011585 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
