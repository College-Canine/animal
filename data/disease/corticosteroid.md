'''Corticosteroids''' are a class of [[steroid hormone]]s that are produced in the [[adrenal cortex]] of [[vertebrates]], as well as the synthetic analogues of these hormones. Two main classes of corticosteroids, [[glucocorticoid]]s and [[mineralocorticoid]]s, are involved in a wide range of [[physiology|physiological]] processes, including [[stress (medicine)|stress response]], [[immune system|immune response]], and regulation of [[inflammation]], [[carbohydrate]] [[metabolism]], [[protein]] [[catabolism]], blood [[electrolyte]] levels, and behavior.<ref name=NusseySaffron2001>{{Cite book|title = Endocrinology: An Integrated Approach| vauthors = Nussey S, Whitehead S |publisher = Oxford: BIOS Scientific Publishers|year = 2001|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26/.| chapter=The adrenal gland }}</ref>

Some common naturally occurring steroid hormones are [[cortisol]] ({{chem|C|21|H|30|O|5}}), [[corticosterone]] ({{chem|C|21|H|30|O|4}}), [[cortisone]] ({{chem|C|21|H|28|O|5}}) and [[aldosterone]] ({{chem|C|21|H|28|O|5}}) (cortisone and [[aldosterone]] are [[isomers]]). The main corticosteroids produced by the adrenal cortex are cortisol and aldosterone.<ref name=NusseySaffron2001 />

[[Dexamethasone]] and its derivatives are almost pure glucocorticoids, while [[prednisone]] and its derivatives have some mineralocorticoid action in addition to the glucocorticoid effect. [[Fludrocortisone]] (Florinef) is a synthetic mineralocorticoid. [[Hydrocortisone]] (cortisol) is typically used for replacement therapy, ''e.g.'' for [[adrenal insufficiency]] and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

Topical formulations are also available for the [[skin disease|skin]], eyes ([[uveitis]]), lungs ([[asthma]]), nose ([[rhinitis]]), and [[inflammatory bowel disease|bowels]]. Corticosteroids are also used supportively to prevent nausea, often in combination with 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists (e.g., [[ondansetron]]).

Typical [[adverse drug reaction|undesired effects]] of glucocorticoids present quite uniformly as drug-induced [[Cushing's syndrome]]. Typical mineralocorticoid side-effects are [[arterial hypertension|hypertension]] (abnormally high blood pressure), steroid induced diabetes mellitus, psychosis, poor sleep, [[hypokalemia]] (low potassium levels in the blood), [[hypernatremia]] (high sodium levels in the blood) without causing [[peripheral edema]], [[metabolic alkalosis]] and connective tissue weakness.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Werner R |title=A massage therapist's guide to Pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Pennsylvania |year=2005 |edition=3rd }}</ref> Wound healing or ulcer formation may be inhibited by the immunosuppressive effects.

==Pharmacology==
Corticosteroids act as [[agonist]]s of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and/or the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]].

==Pharmacogenetics==

===Asthma===
Patients' response to inhaled corticosteroids has some basis in genetic variations. Two genes of interest are CHRH1 ([[corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1]]) and TBX21 ([[transcription factor T-bet]]). Both genes display some degree of polymorphic variation in humans, which may explain how some patients respond better to inhaled corticosteroid therapy than others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantisira KG, Lake S, Silverman ES, Palmer LJ, Lazarus R, Silverman EK, Liggett SB, Gelfand EW, Rosenwasser LJ, Richter B, Israel E, Wechsler M, Gabriel S, Altshuler D, Lander E, Drazen J, Weiss ST | display-authors = 6 | title = Corticosteroid pharmacogenetics: association of sequence variants in CRHR1 with improved lung function in asthmatics treated with inhaled corticosteroids | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 13 | pages = 1353–1359 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15128701 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddh149 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tantisira KG, Hwang ES, Raby BA, Silverman ES, Lake SL, Richter BG, Peng SL, Drazen JM, Glimcher LH, Weiss ST | display-authors = 6 | title = TBX21: a functional variant predicts improvement in asthma with the use of inhaled corticosteroids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 52 | pages = 18099–18104 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15604153 | pmc = 539815 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0408532102 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2004PNAS..10118099T }}</ref> However, not all asthma patients respond to corticosteroids and large sub groups of asthma patients are corticosteroid resistant.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters MC, Kerr S, Dunican EM, Woodruff PG, Fajt ML, Levy BD, Israel E, Phillips BR, Mauger DT, Comhair SA, Erzurum SC, Johansson MW, Jarjour NN, Coverstone AM, Castro M, Hastie AT, Bleecker ER, Wenzel SE, Fahy JV | display-authors = 6 | title = Refractory airway type 2 inflammation in a large subgroup of asthmatic patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–113.e14 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 29524537 | pmc = 6128784 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2017.12.1009 }}</ref>

* Cardiovascular: Corticosteroids can cause sodium retention through a direct action on the kidney, in a manner analogous to the mineralocorticoid [[aldosterone]]. This can result in fluid retention and [[hypertension]].
* Metabolic: Corticosteroids cause a movement of body fat to the face and torso, resulting in "[[moon face]]", "buffalo hump", and "pot belly" or "beer belly", and cause movement of body fat away from the limbs.

==Biosynthesis==
[[Image:Steroidogenesis.png|right|thumb|450px|[[Steroidogenesis]], including corticosteroid biosynthesis.]]

The corticosteroids are synthesized from [[cholesterol]] within the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref name=NusseySaffron2001 /> Most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by [[enzyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450]] family. They are located within the [[mitochondria]] and require [[adrenodoxin]] as a cofactor (except [[21-hydroxylase]] and [[17α-hydroxylase]]).

[[Aldosterone]] and [[corticosterone]] share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is mediated either by the [[aldosterone synthase]] (for [[aldosterone]]) or by the [[11β-hydroxylase]] (for [[corticosterone]]). These enzymes are nearly identical (they share 11β-hydroxylation and 18-hydroxylation functions), but aldosterone synthase is also able to perform an 18-oxidation. Moreover, aldosterone synthase is found within the [[zona glomerulosa]] at the outer edge of the [[adrenal cortex]]; 11β-hydroxylase is found in the [[zona fasciculata]] and [[zona glomerulosa]].

==Classification==

===By chemical structure===
In general, corticosteroids are grouped into four classes, based on chemical structure. Allergic reactions to one member of a class typically indicate an intolerance of all members of the class. This is known as the "Coopman classification".<ref name="isbn1-55009-378-9">{{cite book | vauthors = Rietschel RL |title=Fisher's Contact Dermatitis, 6/e |publisher=BC Decker Inc |location=Hamilton, Ont |year=2007 |page=256 |isbn=978-1-55009-378-0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid2757954">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coopman S, Degreef H, Dooms-Goossens A | title = Identification of cross-reaction patterns in allergic contact dermatitis from topical corticosteroids | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 121 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–34 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2757954 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1989.tb01396.x | s2cid = 40425526 }}</ref>

[[Tadeusz Reichstein]], [[Edward Calvin Kendall]], and [[Philip Showalter Hench]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for [[Physiology]] and [[Medicine]] in 1950 for their work on hormones of the adrenal cortex, which culminated in the isolation of [[cortisone]].<ref name="pmid24540604">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kendall EC | title = The development of cortisone as a therapeutic agent | journal = Antibiotics & Chemotherapy (Northfield, Ill.) | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–15 | date = April 1951 | pmid = 24540604 | doi = | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/kendall-lecture.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415234708/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/kendall-lecture.pdf | archive-date = 15 April 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Initially hailed as a [[miracle]] cure and liberally prescribed during the 1950s, steroid treatment brought about [[adverse events]] of such a magnitude that the next major category of anti-inflammatory drugs, the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), was so named in order to demarcate from the opprobrium.<ref name="Buer_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buer JK | title = Origins and impact of the term 'NSAID' | journal = Inflammopharmacology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 263–267 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25064056 | doi = 10.1007/s10787-014-0211-2 | hdl-access = free | s2cid = 16777111 | hdl = 10852/45403 }}</ref> Corticosteroids were voted [[Allergen of the Year]] in 2005 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/505245 |title=Contact Allergen of the Year: Corticosteroids: Introduction |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2005-06-13|access-date=2012-11-30}}</ref>

[[Lewis Sarett]] of [[Merck & Co.]] was the first to synthesize cortisone, using a 36-step process that started with deoxycholic acid, which was extracted from [[ox]] [[bile]].<ref>{{cite patent | inventor = Sarett LH | gdate = 1947 | title = Process of Treating Pregnene Compounds | country = US | number = 2462133 }}</ref> The low efficiency of converting deoxycholic acid into cortisone led to a cost of US$200 per gram in 1947. [[Russell Marker]], at [[Syntex]], discovered a much cheaper and more convenient starting material, [[diosgenin]] from wild [[Mexican yam]]s. His conversion of diosgenin into [[progesterone]] by a four-step process now known as [[Marker degradation]] was an important step in mass production of all steroidal hormones, including cortisone and chemicals used in [[hormonal contraception]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marker RE, Wagner RB | title = Steroidal sapogenins | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 2167–2230 | date = September 1947 | pmid = 20262743 | doi = 10.1021/ja01201a032 }}</ref>

In 1952, D.H. Peterson and H.C. Murray of [[Upjohn]] developed a process that used ''[[Rhizopus]]'' mold to oxidize progesterone into a compound that was readily converted to cortisone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson DH, Murray HC |title=Microbiological Oxygenation of Steroids at Carbon 11 |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=1871–2 |year=1952 |doi=10.1021/ja01127a531 }}</ref> The ability to cheaply synthesize large quantities of cortisone from the diosgenin in yams resulted in a rapid drop in price to US$6 per gram{{when|date=August 2023}}, falling to $0.46 per gram by 1980. [[Percy Lavon Julian|Percy Julian's]] research also aided progress in the field.<ref>{{cite patent | inventor = Julian L, Cole JW, Meyer EW, Karpel WJ | gdate = 1956 | title = Preparation of Cortisone | country = US | number = 2752339 }}</ref> The exact nature of cortisone's anti-inflammatory action remained a mystery for years after, however, until the [[leukocyte adhesion cascade]] and the role of [[phospholipase A2]] in the production of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s was fully understood in the early 1980s.

===Etymology===
The ''[[wikt:cortico-#Prefix|cortico-]]'' part of the name refers to the [[adrenal cortex]], which makes these steroid hormones. Thus a corticosteroid is a "cortex steroid".
