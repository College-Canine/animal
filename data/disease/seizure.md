==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Seizure types}}
The signs and symptoms of seizures vary depending on the type.<ref name="EB06">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=77|title=Seizures and Status Epilepticus: Diagnosis and Management in the Emergency Department| vauthors = Shearer P |work=Emergency Medicine Practice |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230141114/https://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=77|archive-date=30 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The most common and stereotypical type of seizure is [[convulsive]] (60%), typically called a tonic-clonic seizure.<ref name=NChp1/> Two-thirds of these begin as [[focal seizure]]s prior to developing into tonic-clonic seizures.<ref name=NChp1/> The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive, an example of which is [[absence seizure]].<ref name="Hughes 404–12">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes JR | title = Absence seizures: a review of recent reports with new concepts | journal = Epilepsy & Behavior | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 404–412 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19632158 | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.06.007 | s2cid = 22023692 }}</ref> When EEG monitoring shows evidence of a seizure, but no symptoms are present, it is referred to as a subclinical seizure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sokol DK, Markand ON, Daly EC, Luerssen TG, Malkoff MD | title = Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) distinguishes seizure types | journal = Seizure | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 323–327 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10933986 | doi = 10.1053/seiz.2000.0406 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Focal seizures===
[[Focal seizure]]s often begin with certain experiences, known as an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]].<ref name=EB06/> These may include sensory (including visual, auditory, etc.), cognitive, autonomic, [[olfactory]] or motor phenomena.<ref name=Ham2010>{{cite book | veditors = McPhee SJ, Hammer GD |title=Pathophysiology of disease : an introduction to clinical medicine|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-162167-0|edition=6th|chapter=7}}</ref>

In a [[complex partial seizure]], a person may appear confused or dazed and cannot respond to questions or direction.<ref name=Ham2010/>

Jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups—known as a ''[[Jacksonian march]]''.<ref name=Brad2012>{{cite book| vauthors = Bradley WG |title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0434-1|edition=6th|chapter=67}}</ref> Unusual activities that are not consciously created may occur.<ref name=Brad2012/> These are known as [[automatisms]] and include simple activities like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick something up.<ref name=Brad2012/>

===Generalized seizures===
There are six main types of generalized seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures.<ref name=NChp9/> They all involve a loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* Tonic-clonic seizures present with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension, along with arching of the back for 10–30&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=Neuro2012/> A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles.<ref name=Neuro2012/> The limbs then begin to shake in unison.<ref name=Neuro2012/> After the shaking has stopped it may take 10–30&nbsp;minutes for the person to return to normal.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles.<ref name=Neuro2012/> The person may turn blue if breathing is impaired.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* Clonic seizures involve shaking of the limbs in unison.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* Myoclonic seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or generalized through the body.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* Absence seizures can be subtle, with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking.<ref name=Ham2010/> The person often does not fall over and may return to normal right after the seizure ends, though there may also be a period of post-ictal disorientation.<ref name="Ham2010"/>
* Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second.<ref name=Brad2012/> This typically occurs bilaterally (on both sides of the body).<ref name=Brad2012/>

===Duration===
A seizure can last from a few seconds to more than five minutes, at which point it is known as [[status epilepticus]].<ref name=Trinka2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trinka E, Höfler J, Zerbs A | title = Causes of status epilepticus | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 53 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 127–138 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22946730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03622.x | s2cid = 5294771 }}</ref> Most tonic-clonic seizures last less than two or three minutes.<ref name=Trinka2012/> Absence seizures are usually around 10&nbsp;seconds in duration.<ref name="Hughes 404–12"/>

===Postictal===
After the active portion of a seizure, there is typically a period of confusion called the [[postictal]] period, before a normal [[level of consciousness]] returns.<ref name=EB06/> This period usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes,<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Holmes TR |title=Handbook of epilepsy|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-7397-3|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLOv8XZ5u48C&pg=PA34|edition=4th}}</ref> but may last for hours.<ref name=Post2010/> Other symptoms during this period include: tiredness, [[headache]], difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior.<ref name=Post2010>{{cite book| vauthors = Panayiotopoulos CP |title=A clinical guide to epileptic syndromes and their treatment based on the ILAE classifications and practice parameter guidelines|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=[London]|isbn=978-1-84628-644-5|page=445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJQQzPTcbYIC&pg=PA445|edition=Rev. 2nd}}</ref> [[Psychosis]] after a seizure occurs in 6–10% of people.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advanced therapy in epilepsy|year=2009|publisher=People's Medical Pub.

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of seizures}}
Seizures have a number of causes.

Different causes of seizures are common in certain age groups.
* [[Neonatal seizure|Seizures in babies]] are most commonly caused by [[hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy]], central nervous system (CNS) infections, trauma, congenital CNS abnormalities, and [[metabolic disorders]].
* The most frequent cause of seizures in children is febrile seizures, which happen in 2–5% of children between the ages of six months and five years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graves RC, Oehler K, Tingle LE | title = Febrile seizures: risks, evaluation, and prognosis | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–153 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22335215 }}</ref>
* During childhood, well-defined epilepsy syndromes are generally seen.
* In adolescence and young adulthood, non-compliance with the medication regimen and sleep deprivation are potential triggers.
* Pregnancy and labor and childbirth, and the post-partum, or post-natal period (after birth) can be at-risk times, especially if there are certain complications like [[pre-eclampsia]].
* During adulthood, the likely causes are alcohol related, strokes, trauma, CNS infections, and brain tumors.<ref name="emcna2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martindale JL, Goldstein JN, Pallin DJ | title = Emergency department seizure epidemiology | journal = Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–27 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21109099 | doi = 10.1016/j.emc.2010.08.002 }}</ref>
* In older adults, [[cerebrovascular disease]] is a very common cause. Other causes are CNS tumors, head trauma, and other degenerative diseases that are common in the older age group, such as [[dementia]].<ref>Harrison's Principles of Medicine. 15th edition</ref>

===Metabolic===
[[Dehydration]] can trigger epileptic seizures if it is severe enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/diet-and-nutrition|title=diet and nutrition|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629135154/http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/diet-and-nutrition#.VY3ny2c63cs|archive-date=29 June 2015|date=8 May 2013}}</ref> A number of disorders including: [[low blood sugar]], [[low blood sodium]], [[hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia]], [[high blood sodium]], [[low blood calcium]] and [[uremia|high blood urea]] levels may cause seizures.<ref name=Neuro2012>{{cite book | vauthors = Greenberg DA, Aminoff MJ, Simon RP |title=Clinical neurology|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-175905-2|edition=8th|chapter=12}}</ref> As may [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and the genetic disorder [[porphyria]].<ref name=Neuro2012/>

===Structural===
* [[Cavernoma]] or [[cavernous malformation]] is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages.
* [[Arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM) is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages.
* Space-occupying lesions in the brain ([[abscess]]es, [[tumour]]s). In people with [[brain tumour]]s, the frequency of epilepsy depends on the location of the tumor in the [[cerebral cortex|cortical region]].<ref name="pmid15187884">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hildebrand J | title = Management of epileptic seizures | journal = Current Opinion in Oncology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–317 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15187884 | doi = 10.1097/01.cco.0000127720.17558.38 | s2cid = 12828909 }}</ref>

===Medications===
Both medication and [[drug overdose]]s can result in seizures,<ref name=Neuro2012/> as may certain medication and [[drug withdrawal]].<ref name=Neuro2012/> Common drugs involved include: [[antidepressants]], [[antipsychotics]], [[cocaine]], [[insulin]], and the [[local anaesthetic]] [[lidocaine]].<ref name=Neuro2012/> Difficulties with withdrawal seizures commonly occur after prolonged alcohol or [[sedative]] use, a condition known as [[delirium tremens]].<ref name=Neuro2012/> In people who are at risk of developing epileptic seizures, common [[herbal medicine]]s such as [[Ephedra (medicine)|ephedra]], [[ginkgo biloba]] and [[Artemisia absinthium|wormwood]] can provoke seizures.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Derek |last2=Quigg |first2=Mark |date=April 2019 |title=Optimizing Management of Medically Responsive Epilepsy |url=http://journals.lww.com/00132979-201904000-00006 |journal=CONTINUUM: Lifelong Learning in Neurology |language=en |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=343–361 |doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000709 |pmid=30921013 |s2cid=85563793 |issn=1080-2371}}</ref>

===Infections===
* Infection with the [[pork tapeworm]], which can cause [[neurocysticercosis]], is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common.<ref name=Bh2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhalla D, Godet B, Druet-Cabanac M, Preux PM | title = Etiologies of epilepsy: a comprehensive review | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 861–876 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21651333 | doi = 10.1586/ern.11.51 | s2cid = 21190601 }}</ref>
* Parasitic infections such as cerebral [[malaria]]. In Nigeria this is one of the most common causes of seizures among children under five years of age.<ref name='"PublicHealthNigeria"'>{{cite web|title=Management of Convulsion in Children, a Health concern in Nigeria|url=https://publichealthng.com/management-of-convulsion-in-children-a-health-concern-in-nigeria/|publisher=[[Public Health Nigeria]]|date=October 2018|access-date=18 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018054917/https://publichealthng.com/management-of-convulsion-in-children-a-health-concern-in-nigeria/|archive-date=18 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Stress ===
Stress can induce seizures in people with [[epilepsy]], and is a risk factor for developing epilepsy. Severity, duration, and time at which stress occurs during development all contribute to frequency and susceptibility to developing epilepsy. It is one of the most frequently self-reported triggers in patients with epilepsy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakken KO, Solaas MH, Kjeldsen MJ, Friis ML, Pellock JM, Corey LA | title = Which seizure-precipitating factors do patients with epilepsy most frequently report? | journal = Epilepsy & Behavior | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–89 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15652738 | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.11.003 | s2cid = 36696690 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haut SR, Hall CB, Masur J, Lipton RB | title = Seizure occurrence: precipitants and prediction | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 20 | pages = 1905–1910 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17998482 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000278112.48285.84 | s2cid = 27433395 }}</ref>

Stress exposure results in [[hormone]] release that mediates its effects in the brain. These hormones act on both excitatory and inhibitory neural [[synapse]]s, resulting in hyper-excitability of [[neuron]]s in the brain. The [[hippocampus]] is known to be a region that is highly sensitive to stress and prone to seizures. This is where mediators of stress interact with their target receptors to produce effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunn BG, Baram TZ | title = Stress and Seizures: Space, Time and Hippocampal Circuits | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 667–679 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28916130 | pmc = 5660662 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2017.08.004 }}</ref>

===Other===
Seizures may occur as a result of [[high blood pressure]], known as [[hypertensive encephalopathy]], or in pregnancy as [[eclampsia]] when accompanied by either seizures or a decreased level of consciousness.<ref name=Neuro2012/> [[Hyperthermia|Very high body temperatures]] may also be a cause.<ref name=Neuro2012/> Typically this requires a temperature greater than {{convert|42|C|F|1}}.<ref name=Neuro2012/>
* [[traumatic brain injury|Head injury]] may cause non-epileptic [[post-traumatic seizure]]s or [[post-traumatic epilepsy]]
* About 3.5 to 5.5% of people with [[celiac disease]] also have seizures.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bushara KO | title = Neurologic presentation of celiac disease | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S92–S97 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15825133 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.02.018 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* Seizures in a person with a [[shunt (medical)|shunt]] may indicate failure
* Hemorrhagic [[stroke]] can occasionally present with seizures, [[embolic]] strokes generally do not (though epilepsy is a common later complication); [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]], a rare type of stroke, is more likely to be accompanied by seizures than other types of stroke
* [[Multiple sclerosis]] may cause seizures
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) deliberately sets out to induce a seizure for the treatment of major depression.
* [[Reflex seizure]] induced by a specific stimulus or [[Reflex seizure#Triggers|trigger]] (extrinsic or intrinsic stimuli)
* For people with [[photosensitive epilepsy]], exposure to flashing lights or rapid blinking may cause a seizure.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-02-23 |title=Photosensitive epilepsy {{!}} Epilepsy Society |url=https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/epileptic-seizures/seizure-triggers/photosensitive-epilepsy |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=epilepsysociety.org.uk |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Photosensitivity and Seizures |url=https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-triggers/photosensitivity |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=Epilepsy Foundation |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |date=November 16, 2022 |title=Case report: A relevant misdiagnosis: Photosensitive epilepsy mimicking a blinking tic |pmc=9709211 |last1=Burlo |first1=F. |last2=Barbi |first2=E. |last3=Carrozzi |first3=M. |last4=Zanus |first4=C. |journal=Frontiers in Pediatrics |volume=10 |page=918420 |doi=10.3389/fped.2022.918420 |pmid=36467468 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Seizures may be divided into provoked and unprovoked.<ref name=Fish2014/> Provoked seizures may also be known as "acute symptomatic seizures" or "reactive seizures".<ref name=Fish2014/> Unprovoked seizures may also be known as "reflex seizures".<ref name=Fish2014/> Depending on the presumed cause [[blood tests]] and [[lumbar puncture]] may be useful.<ref name=AFP2012/> [[Hypoglycemia]] may cause seizures and should be ruled out. An [[electroencephalogram]] and brain imaging with [[CT scan]] or [[MRI scan]] is recommended in the work-up of seizures not associated with a fever.<ref name=AFP2012/><ref name=EB10/>

===Classification===
[[Seizure type]]s are organized by whether the source of the seizure is localized ([[focal seizures]]) or distributed ([[generalized seizure]]s) within the brain.<ref name=NChp9>{{cite book|title=The Epilepsies: The diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children in primary and secondary care|publisher=National Clinical Guideline Centre|chapter=Chapter 9: Classification of seizures and epilepsy syndromes|pages=119–129|chapter-url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13635/57784/57784.pdf|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=January 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216151008/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13635/57784/57784.pdf|archive-date=16 December 2013}}</ref> Generalized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body and include [[tonic-clonic]] (grand mal), [[Absence seizure|absence]] (petit mal), [[myoclonic]], [[clonic]], tonic, and [[Atonic seizure|atonic]] seizures.<ref name=NChp9/><ref>{{cite book|author=Simon D.

Focal seizures (previously called ''partial seizures'')<ref name=NChp1/> are divided into [[Simple partial seizure|simple partial]] or [[complex partial seizure]].<ref name=NChp9/> Current practice no longer recommends this, and instead prefers to describe what occurs during a seizure.<ref name=NChp9/>

The classification of seizures can also be made according to dynamical criteria, observable in electrophysiological measurements. It is a classification according to their type of onset and offset.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saggio ML, Crisp D, Scott JM, Karoly P, Kuhlmann L, Nakatani M, Murai T, Dümpelmann M, Schulze-Bonhage A, Ikeda A, Cook M, Gliske SV, Lin J, Bernard C, Jirsa V, Stacey WC | display-authors = 6 | title = A taxonomy of seizure dynamotypes | journal = eLife | volume = 9 | pages = e55632 | date = July 2020 | pmid = 32691734 | pmc = 7375810 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.55632 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Depannemaecker 4–8">{{cite journal | vauthors = Depannemaecker D, Destexhe A, Jirsa V, Bernard C | title = Modeling seizures: From single neurons to networks | language = English | journal = Seizure | volume = 90 | pages = 4–8 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34219016 | doi = 10.1016/j.seizure.2021.06.015 | s2cid = 235468072 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Physical examination===
[[File:Bittentongue.JPG|thumb|An individual who has bitten the tip of their tongue while having a seizure]]

Most people are in a [[postictal state]] (drowsy or confused) following a seizure. They may show signs of other injuries.

===Tests===
[[File:EEG Recording Cap.jpg|thumb|left|An EEG can aid in locating the focus of the epileptic seizure.]]

An [[electroencephalography]] is only recommended in those who likely had an epileptic seizure and may help determine the type of seizure or syndrome present.<!--<ref name=NChp4> --> In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure.<!--<ref name=NChp4> --> It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease.<!--<ref name=NChp4> --> In certain situations it may be useful to prefer the EEG while sleeping or sleep deprived.<ref name=NChp4>{{cite book|title=The Epilepsies: The diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children in primary and secondary care|publisher=National Clinical Guideline Centre|chapter=4|pages=57–83|chapter-url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13635/57784/57784.pdf|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=January 2012}}</ref>

<!-- Same as Epilepsy -->
Diagnostic imaging by [[CT scan]] and [[MRI]] is recommended after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems inside the brain.<ref name=NChp4/> MRI is generally a better imaging test except when intracranial bleeding is suspected.<ref name=AFP2012/> Imaging may be done at a later point in time in those who return to their normal selves while in the emergency room.<ref name=AFP2012/> If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging repeat imaging is not usually needed with subsequent seizures.<ref name=NChp4/>

In adults, testing electrolytes, [[blood glucose]] and calcium levels is important to rule these out as causes, as is an [[electrocardiogram]].<ref name=NChp4/> A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a [[central nervous system]] infection but is not routinely needed.<ref name=AFP2012/> Routine antiseizure medical levels in the blood are not required in adults or children.<ref name=NChp4/> In children additional tests may be required.<ref name=NChp4/>

===Differential diagnosis===
Differentiating an epileptic seizure from other conditions such as [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] can be difficult.<ref name=EB06/> Other possible conditions that can mimic a seizure include: [[decerebrate posturing]], [[psychogenic seizures]], [[tetanus]], [[dystonia]], [[migraine headache]]s, and [[strychnine#Symptoms|strychnine poisoning]].<ref name=EB06/> In addition, 5% of people with a positive [[tilt table test]] may have seizure-like activity that seems due to [[cerebral hypoxia]].<ref name="pmid12963568">{{cite journal | vauthors = Passman R, Horvath G, Thomas J, Kruse J, Shah A, Goldberger J, Kadish A | title = Clinical spectrum and prevalence of neurologic events provoked by tilt table testing | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 163 | issue = 16 | pages = 1945–1948 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12963568 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.163.16.1945 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Convulsions may occur due to psychological reasons and this is known as a [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizure]]. [[Non-epileptic seizures]] may also occur due to a number of other reasons.

==Prevention==
A number of measures have been attempted to prevent seizures in those at risk. Following [[traumatic brain injury]] anticonvulsants decrease the risk of early seizures but not late seizures.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhalgh J, Weston J, Dundar Y, Nevitt SJ, Marson AG | title = Antiepileptic drugs as prophylaxis for postcraniotomy seizures | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | pages = CD007286 | date = April 2020 | issue = 4 | pmid = 32343399 | pmc = 7195181 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007286.pub5 }}</ref>

In those with a history of [[febrile seizures]], some medications (both [[antipyretic]]s and anticonvulsants) have been found effective for reducing reoccurrence, however due to the frequency of adverse effects and the benign nature of febrile seizures the decision to use medication should be weighted carefully against potential negative effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Offringa M, Newton R, Nevitt SJ, Vraka K | title = Prophylactic drug management for febrile seizures in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2021 | issue = 6 | pages = CD003031 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 34131913 | pmc = 8207248 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003031.pub4 }}</ref>

Ongoing anti-epileptic medications are not typically recommended after a first seizure except in those with structural lesions in the brain.<ref name=EB10/> They are generally recommended after a second one has occurred.<ref name=EB10/> Approximately 70% of people can obtain full control with continuous use of medication.<ref name="WHO2012"/> Typically one type of anticonvulsant is preferred. Following a first seizure, while immediate treatment with an anti-seizure drug lowers the probability of seizure recurrence up to five years it does not change the risk of death and there are potential side effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leone MA, Giussani G, Nevitt SJ, Marson AG, Beghi E | title = Immediate antiepileptic drug treatment, versus placebo, deferred, or no treatment for first unprovoked seizure | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2021 | issue = 5 | pages = CD007144 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 33942281 | pmc = 8094016 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007144.pub3 }}</ref>

In seizures related to toxins, up to two doses of benzodiazepines should be used.<ref name=Tox2011/> If this is not effective [[pyridoxine]] is recommended.<ref name=Tox2011/> [[Phenytoin]] should generally not be used.<ref name=Tox2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma AN, Hoffman RJ | title = Toxin-related seizures | journal = Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–139 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21109109 | doi = 10.1016/j.emc.2010.08.011 }}</ref>

==History==

The term "epilepsy" itself is a Greek word, which is derived from the verb "epilambanein", meaning "to seize, possess, or afflict".<ref name=":7" /> Although the Ancient Greeks referred to epilepsy as the "[[The Sacred Disease|sacred disease]]", this perception of epilepsy as a "spiritual" disease was challenged by Hippocrates in his work ''On the Sacred Disease'', who proposed that the source of epilepsy was from natural causes rather than supernatural ones.<ref name=":8" />

Early surgical treatment of epilepsy was primitive in Ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Meador KJ, Loring DW, Flanigin HF |date=January 1989|title=History of epilepsy surgery|journal=Journal of Epilepsy|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21–25|doi=10.1016/0896-6974(89)90054-6|issn=0896-6974}}</ref> The 19th century saw the rise of targeted surgery for the treatment of epileptic seizures, beginning in 1886 with localized resections performed by Sir [[Victor Horsley]], a neurosurgeon in London.<ref name=":8" /> Another advancement was that of the development by the Montreal procedure by Canadian neurosurgeon [[Wilder Penfield]], which involved use of electrical stimulation among conscious patients to more accurately identify and resect the epileptic areas in the brain.<ref name=":8" />

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
<!--Same as section at Epilepsy  -->
Seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States.<ref name=AFP2012/> Epilepsy results in economic costs in Europe of around €15.5&nbsp;billion in 2004.<ref name=NChp1/> In India, epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7&nbsp;billion or 0.5% of the GDP.<ref name="WHO2012"/> They make up about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.<ref name = emcna2011/>

===Driving===
Many areas of the world require a minimum of six months from the last seizure before people can drive a vehicle.<ref name=AFP2012/>

==Research==
Scientific work into the prediction of epileptic seizures began in the 1970s. Several techniques and methods have been proposed, but evidence regarding their usefulness is still lacking.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Litt B, Echauz J | title = Prediction of epileptic seizures | journal = The Lancet. Neurology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–30 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12849542 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00003-0 | s2cid = 10109539 }}</ref>

Gene therapy for epilepsy consists of employing vectors to deliver pieces of genetic material to areas of the brain involved in seizure onset.<ref name=":3" />

Seizure prediction is a special case of seizure detection in which the developed systems is able to issue a warning before the clinical onset of the epileptic seizure.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

Computational neuroscience has been able to bring a new point of view on the seizures by considering the dynamical aspects.<ref name="Depannemaecker 4–8"/>
