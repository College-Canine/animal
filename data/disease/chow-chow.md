The '''Chow Chow''' is a [[spitz]]-type of [[dog breed]] originally from [[North China|Northern China]].<ref>Case, Linda P. (2005). ''The Dog: Its Behavior, Nutrition, and Health'' (2nd ed.), p. 23.

[[File:Chow-Chow from 1915.JPG|thumb|left|A Chow Chow in 1915]]

The Chow Chow has been identified as a [[Dog breed#Basal breeds|basal breed]] that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, G|year=2012|title=Rethinking dog domestication by integrating genetics, archeology, and biogeography|doi=10.1073/pnas.1203005109|pmid=22615366|pmc=3384140|volume=109|journal=Proc.

One Chinese legend mentions large war dogs from Central Asia that resembled black-tongued lions. One Chinese ruler was said to own 5,000 Chows. The Chinese also used Chows to pull [[dog sled]]s through swampy terrain, and this was remarked upon by [[Marco Polo]].<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|11}}

Today, the [[American Kennel Club]] registers approximately 10,000 Chow Chows a year. The [[Canadian Kennel Club]] registers approximately 350.<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}}

== Appearance ==
[[File:03 Bokeh the Chow.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the Chow Chow's characteristic blue-black tongue in a female Chow Chow]]
The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense [[double coat]] that is either smooth or rough.<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}} The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]] or [[:wikt:mane|mane]] appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}}<ref name="Colours and coat types"/>
Not all these color varieties are recognized as valid in all countries. Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.
Chow Chow eyes are typically deep set and almond shaped. The breed is unique by their purple/blue-black tongue which no other breed has except [[Shar Pei]], and has very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather stilted gait.<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}} The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow's lips; this is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their mouths).<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}} Another distinctive feature is the curly tail.<ref name="Wilcox1999" />{{rp|4–5}} It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black, but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose. According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is not acceptable for contests.<ref name="AKC">{{cite web|title=AKC MEET THE BREEDS: Chow Chow|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/chow_chow/|work=American Kennel Club|publisher=American Kennel Club (AKC)|access-date=July 10, 2012|author=American Kennel Club|date=January 1, 2006}}</ref> FCI countries, however, do allow a self-colored nose in the cream.<ref>{{cite web|title=The FCI Breed Standard|url=http://www.chowchow.at/en/breed/the-FCI-chow-chow-breed-standard.shtml|work=CHOWCHOW.at|publisher=CHOWCHOW.at Alle Rechte vorbehalten|access-date=July 10, 2012|author=CHOWCHOW.at|date=June 9, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811125528/http://www.chowchow.at/en/breed/the-FCI-chow-chow-breed-standard.shtml|archive-date=August 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue color. However, the blue-black/purple tongue can also be found on the [[Shar Pei]]. This is not to say that every mixed breed dog with spots of purple on the tongue is descended from Chow Chow, as purple spots on the tongue can be found on other [[purebred dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Truth About Those Black Tongues|url=http://www.chowwelfare.com/cciw/blacktongue.htm|work=Chow Chow Information and Adoption Center|publisher=WisconsinChow Chow Rescue|access-date=July 10, 2012|author=Kathy Welsh|author2=Anna Wallace |author3=Vicki DeGruy |year=2001–2010}}</ref>

== Colors ==
Chow Chows can come in a variety of coat colors. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has classified Chow Chow colors as either standard or non-standard (rare colors). The standard colors for Chow Chows are black, blue, red, cream, and cinnamon. However, colors such as fawn, white, and merle are not considered standard for this breed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chow Chow Dog Breed Information |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chow-chow/ |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=American Kennel Club |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Christina |date=2021-06-18 |title=Chow Chow Colors: A Guide To Rare Colors Of Chow Chow Dogs |url=https://www.pupvine.com/chow-chow-colors/ |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=PupVine |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Sigmund Freud]] had a Chow Chow named [[Jofi|Jo-Fi Ling]] who attended all of his therapy sessions because he felt that dogs had a special sense that allows them to judge a person's character accurately, and admitted he depended on Jo-Fi for an assessment of a patient's mental state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=What Do Dogs Know?|year=1997|publisher=Free Press|page=128}}</ref>

U.S. Navy admiral [[George Dewey]] acquired a Chow Chow in Hong Kong in 1898 and named it Bob. Bob rarely left the admiral's side and had the run of the cruiser {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}. Bob died in 1899 due to eating chocolates given to Dewey by well-wishers upon ''Olympia''{{'}}s arrival in New York City.{{cn|date=March 2024}}

[[Walt Disney]] and his wife, [[Lillian Disney]], had a Chow Chow named Sunnee. It was the couple's first dog.
