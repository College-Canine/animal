'''Concrete''' is a [[composite material]] composed of [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] bonded together with a fluid [[cement]] that cures to a solid over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after [[water]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gagg |first1=Colin R. |title=Cement and concrete as an engineering material: An historic appraisal and case study analysis |journal=Engineering Failure Analysis |date=May 2014 |volume=40 |pages=114–140 |doi=10.1016/j.engfailanal.2014.02.004 }}</ref> and is the most widely used building material.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crow|first=James Mitchell|date=March 2008|title=The concrete conundrum|url=https://www.rsc.org/images/Construction_tcm18-114530.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.rsc.org/images/Construction_tcm18-114530.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|journal=Chemistry World|pages=62–66}}</ref> Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminium combined.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Manager |first=Samsung C&T Global PR |date=2018-06-27 |title=Concrete Matters: A Primer on the Most Popular Man-Made Material |url=https://news.samsungcnt.com/en/features/engineering-construction/2018-06-concrete-matters-primer-popular-man-made-material/ |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=Samsung C&T Newsroom |language=en-US}}</ref>

When aggregate is mixed with dry [[Portland cement]] and [[water]], the mixture forms a fluid [[slurry]] that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts with the water through a process called concrete hydration<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/prin.html |title=Scientific Principles |website=matse1.matse.illinois.edu |access-date=24 May 2023 }}</ref> that hardens it over several hours to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.<ref>{{cite book|first = Zongjin|last= Li|title = Advanced concrete technology|year= 2011|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|isbn = 978-0470902431}}</ref> This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms, but also to have a variety of tooled processes performed. The hydration process is [[Exothermic process|exothermic]], which means ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set. Often, additives (such as [[pozzolan]]s or [[superplasticizer]]s) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, or otherwise change the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as steel [[rebar]]) embedded to provide [[tensile strength]], yielding [[reinforced concrete]].

In the past, [[Lime (material)|lime]] based cement binders, such as lime putty, were often used but sometimes with other [[hydraulic cement]]s, (water resistant) such as a [[calcium aluminate cements|calcium aluminate cement]] or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (named for its visual resemblance to [[Portland stone]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrialresourcescouncil.org/Applications/PortlandCementConcrete/tabid/381/Default.aspx|title=Portland Cement Concrete|last=Industrial Resources Council|date=2008|website=www.industrialresourcescouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pubs/013683.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pubs/013683.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Portland Cement Concrete Materials|last=National Highway Institute|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]}}</ref> Many other non-cementitious [[types of concrete]] exist with other methods of binding aggregate together, including [[asphalt concrete]] with a [[bitumen]] binder, which is frequently used for [[road surface]]s, and [[polymer concrete]]s that use polymers as a binder.

== Etymology ==
The word concrete comes from the Latin word "''concretus''" (meaning compact or condensed),<ref>{{cite web|title=concretus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|publisher=Latin Lookup|access-date=1 October 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512013931/http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|archive-date=12 May 2013}}</ref> the perfect passive participle of "''concrescere''", from "''con''-" (together) and "''crescere''" (to grow).

Mayan concrete at the ruins of [[Uxmal]] (850–925 A.D.) is referenced in ''Incidents of Travel in the Yucatán'' by [[John Lloyd Stephens|John L. Stephens]]. "The roof is flat and had been covered with cement". "The floors were cement, in some places hard, but, by long exposure, broken, and now crumbling under the feet." "But throughout the wall was solid, and consisting of large stones imbedded in mortar, almost as hard as rock."

Small-scale production of concrete-like materials was pioneered by the [[Nabataea|Nabatean]] traders who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan from the 4th century BC. They discovered the advantages of [[hydraulic lime]], with some self-cementing properties, by 700 BC. They built [[kiln]]s to supply mortar for the construction of [[rubble masonry]] houses, concrete floors, and underground waterproof [[cistern]]s. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the Nabataeans to thrive in the desert.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm |title=The History of Concrete |last1=Gromicko|first1=Nick|last2=Shepard|first2=Kenton|date=2016|website=International Association of Certified Home Inspectors, Inc.|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref> Some of these structures survive to this day.<ref name=":1" />

<blockquote>Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material.

<blockquote>Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.<ref>Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: "On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon", ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5</ref></blockquote>

The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and bridges, such as the magnificent [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France, have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

===Middle Ages===
After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced. Low kiln temperatures in the burning of lime, lack of pozzolana, and poor mixing all contributed to a decline in the quality of concrete and mortar. From the 11th century, the increased use of stone in church and [[castle]] construction led to an increased demand for mortar. Quality began to improve in the 12th century through better grinding and sieving. Medieval lime mortars and concretes were non-hydraulic and were used for binding masonry, "hearting" (binding [[rubble masonry]] cores) and foundations. [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]] in his ''De proprietatibus rerum'' (1240) describes the making of mortar. In an English translation from 1397, it reads "lyme ... is a stone brent; by medlynge thereof with sonde and water sement is made". From the 14th century, the quality of mortar was again excellent, but only from the 17th century was pozzolana commonly added.<ref>Peter Hewlett and Martin Liska (eds.), ''Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete'', 5th ed. (Butterworth-Heinemann, 2019), pp. 3–4.</ref>

The ''[[Canal du Midi]]'' was built using concrete in 1670.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rassia |first1=Stamatina Th |last2=Pardalos |first2=Panos M. |title=Cities for Smart Environmental and Energy Futures: Impacts on Architecture and Technology |date=15 August 2013 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-3-642-37661-0 |page=58 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=vFu6BAAAQBAJ|page=58}} |language=en}}</ref>

==Composition==
{{See also|Slag|Heavy metals}}

Concrete is an artificial [[composite material]], comprising a matrix of cementitious binder (typically [[Portland cement]] paste or [[Bitumen|asphalt]]) and a dispersed phase or "filler" of [[#Aggregates|aggregate]] (typically a rocky material, loose stones, and sand). The binder "glues" the filler together to form a synthetic [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=Concrete: Scientific Principles |url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/prin.html|access-date=2021-10-06|website=matse1.matse.illinois.edu}}</ref> Many [[types of concrete]] are available, determined by the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit the application of the engineered material. These variables determine strength and density, as well as chemical and thermal resistance of the finished product.

[[Construction aggregate]]s consist of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse [[gravel]] or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].

Cement paste, most commonly made of [[Portland cement]], is the most prevalent kind of concrete binder. For cementitious binders, [[water]] is mixed with the dry cement powder and aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid slurry (paste) that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust, stone-like material. Other cementitious materials, such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], are sometimes added—either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component—and become a part of the binder for the aggregate.<ref name=flyash>{{cite journal |last1=Askarian |first1=Mahya |last2=Fakhretaha Aval |first2=Siavash |last3=Joshaghani |first3=Alireza |title=A comprehensive experimental study on the performance of pumice powder in self-compacting concrete (SCC) |journal=Journal of Sustainable Cement-Based Materials |date=22 January 2019 |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=340–356 |doi=10.1080/21650373.2018.1511486 |s2cid=139554392 }}</ref> Fly ash and slag can enhance some properties of concrete such as fresh properties and durability.<ref name=flyash/> Alternatively, other materials can also be used as a concrete binder: the most prevalent substitute is [[Bitumen|asphalt]], which is used as the binder in [[asphalt concrete]].

Admixtures are added to modify the cure rate or properties of the material. [[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]] use recycled materials as concrete ingredients. Conspicuous materials include [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]; [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], a by-product of [[steelmaking]]; and [[silica fume]], a by-product of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s.

Structures employing Portland cement concrete usually include [[#Reinforcement|steel reinforcement]] because this type of concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]]. Therefore, it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension, typically [[steel]] [[rebar]].

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.

===Cement===

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], and many [[plaster]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Melander|first1=John M.|last2=Farny|first2=James A.|last3=Isberner|first3=Albert W.

Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminium and iron) and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

[[Cement kiln]]s are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then [[Cement mill|grind it into cement]]. Many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cement Production|url=http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|publisher=IEA ETSAP – Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme|access-date=9 January 2013|author=Evelien Cochez|author2=Wouter Nijs|name-list-style=amp|author3=Giorgio Simbolotti|author4=Giancarlo Tosato|location= |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124004654/http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|archive-date=24 January 2013}}</ref> The five major compounds of calcium silicates and aluminates comprising Portland cement range from 5 to 50% in weight.

===Curing===
Combining [[water]] with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Jack|title=Measuring Water in Concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|publisher=Concrete Construction|access-date=1 October 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511192721/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|archive-date=11 May 2013}}</ref>

As stated by [[Abrams' law]], a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durable]] concrete, whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher [[Workability|slump]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 9: Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixtures |url=http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|work=PCA manual|publisher=Portland Concrete Association|access-date=1 October 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526015347/http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2012}}</ref> The hydration of cement involves many concurrent reactions.

===Aggregates===
{{main|Construction aggregate}}
[[File:Gravel 03375C.JPG|thumbnail|Crushed stone [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]]]]

Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel, and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as paste the surfaces of the aggregate together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus, variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete |url=https://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm |access-date=2022-08-13 |website=www.engr.psu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225184337/http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm |date=25 December 2012 |publisher=Engr.psu.edu|archive-date=25 December 2012 }}</ref> The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not negatively affect the strength of the concrete.

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates non-homogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.<ref name="Veretennykov Yugov Dolmatov et al 2008">{{cite book |doi=10.1061/41002(328)17 |chapter=Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-in-Place Elements in Skeleton-Type Buildings |title=AEI 2008 |year=2008 |last1=Veretennykov |first1=Vitaliy I. |last2=Yugov |first2=Anatoliy M. |last3=Dolmatov |first3=Andriy O. |last4=Bulavytskyi |first4=Maksym S. |last5=Kukharev |first5=Dmytro I. |last6=Bulavytskyi |first6=Artem S. |pages=1–10 |isbn=978-0784410028 }}</ref>

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative "exposed aggregate" finish, popular among landscape designers.

===Admixtures===
Admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. Admixtures are defined as additions "made as the concrete mix is being prepared".<ref name=text>{{cite book|isbn=978-0727736116 |doi=10.1680/pc.36116.185 |chapter=Admixtures and Special Cements |title=Portland Cement: Third edition |author1=Gerry Bye |author2=Paul Livesey |author3=Leslie Struble |year=2011|doi-broken-date=31 January 2024 }}</ref> The most common admixtures are retarders and accelerators. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.<ref name="FHWA Admixtures">{{cite web |author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration |author-link=Federal Highway Administration |title=Admixtures |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html |access-date=25 January 2007 |date=14 June 1999 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127132641/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html |archive-date=27 January 2007 }}</ref> (See {{section link||Production}} below.)

* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride]], [[calcium nitrate]] and [[sodium nitrate]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored, even though they are less effective than the chloride salt. Accelerating admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete in cold weather.
* [[Air entrainment|Air entraining agents]] add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, increasing [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durability]]. However, entrained air entails a tradeoff with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength by 5%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamakareem |first1=Madeh Izat |title=Effect of Air Entrainment on Concrete Strength |url=https://theconstructor.org/concrete/effect-air-entrainment-concrete-strength/8427/ |website=The Constructor |date=14 November 2013 |access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref> If too much air becomes trapped in the concrete as a result of the mixing process, [[defoamer]]s can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Crystalline admixtures are typically added during batching of the concrete to lower permeability. The reaction takes place when exposed to water and un-hydrated cement particles to form insoluble needle-shaped crystals, which fill capillary pores and micro-cracks in the concrete to block pathways for water and waterborne contaminates. Concrete with crystalline admixture can expect to self-seal as constant exposure to water will continuously initiate crystallization to ensure permanent waterproof protection.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic, or "fresh", concrete, allowing it to be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are sometimes called water-reducers due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics.
* [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called high-range water-reducers) are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Superplasticizers are used to increase compressive strength. It increases the [[#Sample analysis—workability|workability]] of the concrete and lowers the need for water content by 15–30%. 
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting is undesirable before completion of the pour. Typical [[polyol]] retarders are [[sugar]], [[sucrose]], [[sodium gluconate]], [[glucose]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].

===Mineral admixtures and blended cements===

* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, siliceous fly ash is [[Pozzolanic activity|pozzolanic]], while [[calcareous]] fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.<ref>{{cite web |author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration |author-link=Federal Highway Administration |title=Fly Ash |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm |access-date=24 January 2007 |date=14 June 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161733/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm |archive-date=21 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

* [[Silica fume]]: A by-product of the production of [[silicon]] and [[ferrosilicon]] [[alloy]]s. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a much faster [[Pozzolanic activity|pozzolanic reaction]].

* High reactivity [[metakaolin]] (HRM): Metakaolin produces concrete with [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[durability]] similar to concrete made with silica fume.

==Production==
[[File:Concrete plant in Mansfield, Ohio.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Concrete plant]] showing a [[concrete mixer]] being filled from ingredient silos]]
[[File:Concrete mixing plant, Birmingham, Alabama, view 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Concrete mixing plant in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], in 1936]]

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a [[concrete plant]], or often a batch plant. The usual method of placement is casting in [[formwork]], which holds the mix in shape until it has set enough to hold its shape unaided.

Concrete plants come in two main types, ready-mix plants and central mix plants. A ready-mix plant blends all of the solid ingredients, while a central mix does the same but adds water. A central-mix plant offers more precise control of the concrete quality.  Central mix plants must be close to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.

A concrete plant consists of large hoppers for storage of various ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a [[concrete mixer]] truck.

Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms.  The forms are containers that define the desired shape. Concrete [[formwork]] can be prepared in several ways, such as [[slip forming]] and [[steel plate construction]]. Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture [[precast concrete]] products.

Interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a ''cold joint'' between the two batches.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cold Joints |url=https://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&id=372 |website=www.concrete.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074543/http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&id=372 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |publisher= [[The Concrete Society]]|access-date= 30 December 2015}}</ref> Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.

===Design mix===
''Design mix'' ratios are decided by an engineer after analyzing the properties of the specific ingredients being used. Instead of using a 'nominal mix' of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 4 parts aggregate (the second example from above), a civil engineer will custom-design a concrete mix to exactly meet the requirements of the site and conditions, setting material ratios and often designing an admixture package to fine-tune the properties or increase the performance envelope of the mix. Design-mix concrete can have very broad specifications that cannot be met with more basic nominal mixes, but the involvement of the engineer often increases the cost of the concrete mix.

Concrete mixes are primarily divided into nominal mix, standard mix and design mix.

Nominal mix ratios are given in volume of <math>\text{Cement : Sand : Aggregate}</math>. Nominal mixes are a simple, fast way of getting a basic idea of the properties of the finished concrete without having to perform testing in advance.

Various governing bodies (such as [[British Standards]]) define nominal mix ratios into a number of grades, usually ranging from lower [[compressive strength]] to higher compressive strength. The grades usually indicate the 28-day cube strength.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilology.com/grades-of-concrete/ |title=Grades of Concrete with Proportion (Mix Ratio)| date=26 March 2018}}</ref>

===Mixing===
{{See also|Volumetric concrete mixer|Concrete mixer}}

Thorough mixing is essential to produce uniform, high-quality concrete.

{{em|Separate paste mixing}} has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Concrete International |url=https://www.concrete.org/publications/concreteinternational.aspx |access-date=2022-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092034/http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 |archive-date=28 September 2007|website=concrete.org|date=1 November 1989}}</ref> The paste is generally mixed in a {{em|high-speed}}, shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/c]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, [[Plasticizer|superplasticizers]], [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]]. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.<ref>{{cite web | title=ACI 304R-00: Guide for Measuring, Mixing, Transporting, and Placing Concrete (Reapproved 2009) | url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30400}}</ref>

===Sample analysis—workability===
{{Main|Concrete slump test}}

Workability is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (pouring, pumping, spreading, tamping, vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. Changes in gradation can also affect workability of the concrete, although a wide range of gradation can be used for various applications.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarviel |first1=Ed |title=Construction Estimating Reference Data |date=1993 |publisher=Craftsman Book Company |isbn=978-0-934041-84-3 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=TopgKO4x_2kC}}|page=74 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=Marllon Daniel |last2=Ghaeezadah |first2=Ashkan |last3=Ley |first3=M.

Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |title=Aggregate in Concrete – the Concrete Network |access-date=15 January 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202232307/https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |archive-date=2 February 2017  }}</ref>

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an "[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]" with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&nbsp;mm) out of {{convert|1|ft|mm|spell=in}}. A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ferrari |first1=L. |last2=Kaufmann |first2=J. |last3=Winnefeld |first3=F. |last4=Plank |first4=J. |title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions |journal=Cement and Concrete Research |date=October 2011 |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=1058–1066 |doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010 }}</ref> Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

===Curing===
[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab being kept hydrated during water curing by submersion (ponding)]]

====Maintaining optimal conditions for cement hydration====
Concrete must be kept moist during curing in order to achieve optimal strength and [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durability]].<ref>"Curing Concrete" Peter C.

This [[carbonation]] reaction, however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the reinforcement bars.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.<ref name="Veretennykov Yugov Dolmatov et al 2008"/> Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073633/http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf|url-status=dead|title="Admixtures for Cementitious Applications."|archive-date=17 October 2016}}</ref>

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|spalling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].

====Curing techniques avoiding water loss by evaporation====
During the curing period, concrete is ideally maintained at controlled temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete slabs are often sprayed with "curing compounds" that create a water-retaining film over the concrete. Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds. After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |title=Home |access-date=12 November 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208184425/http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |archive-date=8 December 2015  }}</ref>

Traditional conditions for curing involve spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water. The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve this, ponding—submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete.

For higher-strength applications, [[accelerated curing]] techniques may be applied to the concrete. A common technique involves heating the poured concrete with steam, which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature so that the hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly.

The terms ''asphalt'' (or ''asphaltic'') ''concrete'', ''bituminous asphalt concrete'', and ''bituminous mixture'' are typically used only in [[engineering]] and construction documents, which define concrete as any composite material composed of mineral aggregate adhered with a binder. The abbreviation, ''AC'', is sometimes used for ''asphalt concrete'' but can also denote ''asphalt content'' or ''asphalt cement'', referring to the liquid asphalt portion of the composite material.

=== Pervious ===
{{Main|Pervious concrete}}

Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water, and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as "no-fines" or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totaling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze-thaw climates to minimize the possibility of frost damage. Pervious concrete also permits rainwater to filter through roads and parking lots, to recharge aquifers, instead of contributing to runoff and flooding.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ground Water Recharging Through Pervious Concrete Pavement |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277231494|access-date=2021-01-26|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref>

=== Polymer ===
{{main|Polymer concrete}}

Polymer concretes are mixtures of aggregate and any of various polymers and may be reinforced. The cement is costlier than lime-based cements, but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages; they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. Polymer concretes are frequently used for the repair and construction of other applications, such as drains.

===Waste light===
{{main|Waste light concrete}}

Waste light is a form of polymer modified concrete. The specific polymer admixture allows the replacement of all the traditional aggregates (gravel, sand, stone) by any mixture of solid waste materials in the grain size of 3–10&nbsp;mm to form a low-compressive-strength (3–20&nbsp;N/mm<sup>2</sup>) product<ref>{{cite web |title=MASUKO light concrete |url=http://www.masuko.hu/eindex.php |access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref> for road and building construction. One cubic meter of waste light concrete contains 1.1–1.3&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of shredded waste and no other aggregates.

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}

Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.civil-engg-world.com/2009/04/relation-between-compressive-and.html | title=Relation Between Compressive and Tensile Strength of Concrete | access-date=6 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106104521/https://www.civil-engg-world.com/2009/04/relation-between-compressive-and.html | archive-date=6 January 2019 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Therefore, it is usually [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.

[[File:Concrete Compression Testing.jpg|thumb|upright|Compression testing of a concrete cylinder]]

The ingredients affect the strengths of the material. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the lower-bound compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test procedures.

The strengths of concrete is dictated by its function. Very low-strength—{{convert|14|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or less—concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.<ref name=lightweight>{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March 1981|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511221842/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|archive-date=11 May 2013}}</ref> Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced.

===Fire safety===
[[File:Boston City Hall - Boston, MA - DSC04704 (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Boston City Hall]] (1968) is a [[Brutalist]] design constructed largely of precast and poured in place concrete.]]

Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However, this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.

===Earthquake safety===
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 |title=Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs FEMA P-774 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912163041/http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067|archive-date=12 September 2011 }}</ref> These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey).<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf |title=Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151034/http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf|archive-date=11 January 2012|first1=C.C. |last1=Simsir |first2=A. |last2=Jain |first3=G.C. |last3=Hart |first4=M.P. |last4=Levy |conference=14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering|date=12–17 October 2008}}</ref>

Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time.

=== Reinforced concrete ===
{{Main|Reinforced concrete}}
[[File:O Cristo Redentor.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. It is made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of triangular [[soapstone]] tiles.<ref name="brit">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Christ the Redeemer (last updated 13 January 2014) |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1435544/Christ-the-Redeemer |access-date=November 5, 2022 |last1=Murray |first1=Lorraine}}</ref>]]

The use of reinforcement, in the form of iron was introduced in the 1850s by French industrialist François Coignet, and it was not until the 1880s that German civil engineer G. A. Wayss used steel as reinforcement. Concrete is a relatively brittle material that is strong under compression but less in tension. Plain, unreinforced concrete is unsuitable for many structures as it is relatively poor at withstanding stresses induced by vibrations, wind loading, and so on. Hence, to increase its overall strength, steel rods, wires, mesh or cables can be embedded in concrete before it is set. This reinforcement, often known as rebar, resists tensile forces.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Reinforced_concrete|title=Reinforced concrete|website=www.designingbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Reinforced concrete|Reinforced concrete (RC)]] is a versatile composite and one of the most widely used materials in modern construction. It is made up of different constituent materials with very different properties that complement each other. In the case of reinforced concrete, the component materials are almost always concrete and steel. These two materials form a strong bond together and are able to resist a variety of applied forces, effectively acting as a single structural element.<ref name=":5">{{Citation|last=Claisse|first=Peter A.|title=Composites|date=2016|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780081002759000383|work=Civil Engineering Materials|pages=431–435|publisher=Elsevier|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-100275-9.00038-3|isbn=978-0081002759|access-date=2021-10-05}}</ref>

Reinforced concrete can be precast or cast-in-place (in situ) concrete, and is used in a wide range of applications such as; slab, wall, beam, column, foundation, and frame construction. Reinforcement is generally placed in areas of the concrete that are likely to be subject to tension, such as the lower portion of beams. Usually, there is a minimum of 50&nbsp;mm cover, both above and below the steel reinforcement, to resist spalling and corrosion which can lead to structural instability.<ref name=":4" /> Other types of non-steel reinforcement, such as [[Fiber-reinforced concrete|Fibre-reinforced concretes]] are used for specialized applications, predominately as a means of controlling cracking.<ref name=":5" />

=== Precast concrete ===
{{main|Precast concrete}}

Precast concrete is concrete which is cast in one place for use elsewhere and is a mobile material. The largest part of precast production is carried out in the works of specialist suppliers, although in some instances, due to economic and geographical factors, scale of product or difficulty of access, the elements are cast on or adjacent to the construction site.<ref name=":12">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-075065686-3/50307-4 |chapter=Precast concrete structural elements |title=Advanced Concrete Technology |date=2003 |last1=Richardson |first1=John |pages=3–46 |isbn=978-0-7506-5686-3 }}</ref> Precasting offers considerable advantages because it is carried out in a controlled environment, protected from the elements, but the downside of this is the contribution to greenhouse gas emission from transportation to the construction site.<ref name=":5" />

Advantages to be achieved by employing precast concrete:<ref name=":12" />

* Preferred dimension schemes exist, with elements of tried and tested designs available from a catalogue.
* Major savings in time result from manufacture of structural elements apart from the series of events which determine overall duration of the construction, known by planning engineers as the 'critical path'.
* Availability of Laboratory facilities capable of the required control tests, many being certified for specific testing in accordance with National Standards.
* Equipment with capability suited to specific types of production such as stressing beds with appropriate capacity, moulds and machinery dedicated to particular products.
* High-quality finishes achieved direct from the mould eliminate the need for interior decoration and ensure low maintenance costs.

===Mass structures===
{{main|Mass concrete}}

After the original reservoir failed, the new reservoir was made of roller-compacted concrete.]]

Due to cement's [[exothermic]] chemical reaction while setting up, large concrete structures such as [[dam]]s, [[navigation lock]]s, large mat foundations, and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects, ''post-cooling''<ref name="BerkCE">{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf |title=Mass Concret |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073606/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating. Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.<ref name="BerkCE"/>

Another approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal by-product is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is deposited in thick layers as a semi-dry material then roller [[compactor|compacted]] into a dense, strong mass.

===Surface finishes===
{{main|Decorative concrete}}
[[File:Smpolishedconcrete2.jpg|thumb|Black basalt polished concrete floor]]

Raw concrete surfaces tend to be porous and have a relatively uninteresting appearance. Many finishes can be applied to improve the appearance and preserve the surface against staining, water penetration, and freezing.

Examples of improved appearance include [[stamped concrete]] where the wet concrete has a pattern impressed on the surface, to give a paved, cobbled or brick-like effect, and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for flooring and table tops is [[polished concrete]] where the concrete is polished optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other sealants.

Other finishes can be achieved with chiseling, or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials.

The proper treatment of the surface of concrete, and therefore its characteristics, is an important stage in the construction and renovation of architectural structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sadowski | first1 = Łukasz | last2 = Mathia | first2 = Thomas | year = 2016| title = Multi-scale Metrology of Concrete Surface Morphology: Fundamentals and specificity | journal = Construction and Building Materials | volume = 113 | pages = 613–621 | doi = 10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.03.099 }}</ref>

===Prestressed structures===
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}
[[File:Scott System cacti.jpg|thumb|Stylized cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]]]

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose tensile stresses experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by
better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.
In pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

There are two different systems being used:<ref name=":5" />

* [[Prestressed concrete|Pretensioned concrete]] is almost always precast, and contains steel wires (tendons) that are held in tension while the concrete is placed and sets around them.
* [[Prestressed concrete|Post-tensioned concrete]] has ducts through it. After the concrete has gained strength, tendons are pulled through the ducts and stressed. The ducts are then filled with grout. Bridges built in this way have experienced considerable corrosion of the tendons, so external post-tensioning may now be used in which the tendons run along the outer surface of the concrete.

More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used [[types of concrete]] functional extensions in modern days. For more information see [[Brutalist architecture]].

===Placement===
Once mixed, concrete is typically transported to the place where it is intended to become a structural item. Various methods of transportation and placement are used depending on the distances involve, quantity needed, and other details of application. Large amounts are often transported by truck, poured free under gravity or through a [[tremie]], or [[Concrete pump|pumped]] through a pipe. Smaller amounts may be carried in a skip (a metal container which can be tilted or opened to release the contents, usually transported by crane or hoist), or wheelbarrow, or carried in toggle bags for manual placement underwater.

====Cold weather placement====
[[File:Pohjolatalo Kouvola 001.jpg|thumb|''Pohjolatalo'', an office building made of concrete in the city center of [[Kouvola]] in [[Kymenlaakso]], [[Finland]]]]

[[Extreme weather]] conditions (extreme heat or cold; windy conditions, and humidity variations) can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions are observed in cold weather placement.<ref name=":3">{{cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|title=Winter is Coming! Precautions for Cold Weather Concreting |date=14 November 2016|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=11 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113155033/http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|archive-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> Low temperatures significantly slow the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement, thus affecting the strength development. Preventing freezing is the most important precaution, as formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from the outside temperatures, the heat of hydration will prevent freezing.

The [[American Concrete Institute]] (ACI) definition of cold weather placement, ACI 306,<ref>{{cite web|title=306R-16 Guide to Cold Weather Concreting|url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204757/https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|archive-date=15 September 2017}}</ref> is:

* A period when for more than three successive days the average daily air temperature drops below 40&nbsp;°F (~ 4.5&nbsp;°C), and
* Temperature stays below {{convert|50|°F|°C|abbr=on}} for more than one-half of any 24-hour period.

In [[Canada]], where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season, the following criteria are used by [[Canadian Standards Agency|CSA]] A23.1:

* When the air temperature is ≤ 5&nbsp;°C, and
* When there is a probability that the temperature may fall below 5&nbsp;°C within 24 hours of placing the concrete.

The minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is {{convert|500|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}. CSA A 23.1 specified a compressive strength of 7.0&nbsp;MPa to be considered safe for exposure to freezing.

==== Underwater placement ====
{{see also|Underwater construction}}
[[File:Tremie operation.png|thumb|upright|Assembled tremie placing concrete underwater]]

Concrete may be placed and cured underwater. Care must be taken in the placement method to prevent washing out the cement. Underwater placement methods include the [[tremie]], pumping, skip placement, manual placement using toggle bags, and bagwork.<ref name="Larn and Whistler 1993">{{cite book|last1=Larn|first1=Richard|last2=Whistler|first2=Rex|title=Commercial Diving Manual|edition=3rd|year=1993|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbott, UK|isbn=0715301004 |chapter=17 – Underwater concreting |pages=297–308}}</ref>

{{visible anchor|Grouted aggregate}} is an alternative method of forming a concrete mass underwater, where the forms are filled with coarse aggregate and the voids then completely filled with pumped [[grout]].<ref name="Larn and Whistler 1993" />

===Roads===
[[Road surface#Concrete|Concrete roads]] are more fuel efficient to drive on,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mapping of Excess Fuel Consumption|url=https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102190351/https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|archive-date=2 January 2015}}</ref> more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that [[pervious concrete]] can be used, which eliminates the need to place [[storm drain]]s near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}<!-- sounds a bit oversimplified -->

==Environment, health and safety==
{{main|Environmental impact of concrete}}
{{unbalanced section|date=January 2024}}

The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental, economic and social impacts.

===Concrete—health and safety===
{{see also|Occupational dust exposure#Construction}}
[[File:Dust emission when using electrical power tools.webm|thumb|upright=0.83|[[Concrete dust]] emission from the use of power tool]]
[[File:Crushed Concrete Granular Fill.jpg|thumb|Recycled crushed concrete, to be reused as granular fill, is loaded into a semi-dump truck]]

Grinding of concrete can produce [[hazardous dust]]. Exposure to cement dust can lead to issues such as [[silicosis]], kidney disease, skin irritation and similar effects. The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] in the United States recommends attaching local exhaust ventilation shrouds to electric concrete grinders to control the spread of this dust. In addition, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has placed more stringent regulations on companies whose workers regularly come into contact with silica dust. An updated silica rule, which OSHA put into effect 23 September 2017 for construction companies, restricted the amount of breathable crystalline silica workers could legally come into contact with to 50 micro grams per cubic meter of air per 8-hour workday. That same rule went into effect 23 June 2018 for general industry, [[hydraulic fracturing]] and maritime. That deadline was extended to 23 June 2021 for engineering controls in the hydraulic fracturing industry. Companies which fail to meet the tightened safety regulations can face financial charges and extensive penalties. The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity. Fresh concrete (before curing is complete) is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment.

===Concrete, cement and the environment===
A major component of concrete is [[cement]], a fine powder used mainly to bind sand and coarser aggregates together in concrete. Although a variety of cement types exist, the most common is "[[Portland cement]]", which is produced by mixing clinker with smaller quantities of other additives such as gypsum and ground limestone. The production of clinker, the main constituent of cement, is responsible for the bulk of the sector's greenhouse gas emissions, including both energy intensity and process emissions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Akerman |first1=Patrick |last2=Cazzola |first2=Pierpaolo |last3=Christiansen |first3=Emma Skov |last4=Heusden |first4=Renée Van |last5=Iperen |first5=Joanna Kolomanska-van |last6=Christensen |first6=Johannah |last7=Crone |first7=Kilian |last8=Dawe |first8=Keith |last9=Smedt |first9=Guillaume De |last10=Keynes |first10=Alex |last11=Laporte |first11=Anaïs |last12=Gonsolin |first12=Florie |last13=Mensink |first13=Marko |last14=Hebebrand |first14=Charlotte |last15=Hoenig |first15=Volker |last16=Malins |first16=Chris |last17=Neuenhahn |first17=Thomas |last18=Pyc |first18=Ireneusz |last19=Purvis |first19=Andrew |last20=Saygin |first20=Deger |last21=Xiao |first21=Carol |last22=Yang |first22=Yufeng |title=Reaching Zero with Renewables |date=1 September 2020 |url=https://www.h2knowledgecentre.com/content/researchpaper1611 }}</ref>

The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas – the other two being energy production and transportation industries. On average, every tonne of cement produced releases one tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Pioneer cement manufacturers have claimed to reach lower carbon intensities, with 590&nbsp;kg of CO<sub>2</sub>eq per tonne of cement produced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leading the way to carbon neutrality |publisher=HeidelbergCement |date=24 September 2020 |url=https://www.heidelbergcement.com/en/system/files_force/assets/document/7e/8c/co2-strategie_factsheets_en.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.heidelbergcement.com/en/system/files_force/assets/document/7e/8c/co2-strategie_factsheets_en.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> The emissions are due to combustion and calcination processes,<ref>{{cite web |title=Cement Clinker Calcination in Cement Production Process |url=http://www.cementplantequipment.com/all-the-things-about-cement-clinker-calcination-in-cement-production-process/ |website=AGICO Cement Plant Supplier |date=4 April 2019 }}</ref> which roughly account for 40% and 60% of the greenhouse gases, respectively. Considering that cement is only a fraction of the constituents of concrete, it is estimated that a tonne of concrete is responsible for emitting about 100–200&nbsp;kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Portland Cement Association |title=Carbon footprint |url=https://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/th-paving-pdfs/sustainability/carbon-foot-print.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.cement.org/docs/default-source/th-paving-pdfs/sustainability/carbon-foot-print.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web |last1=Lehne |first1=Johanna |last2=Preston |first2=Felix |title=Making Concrete Change: Innovation in Low-carbon Cement and Concrete |date=13 June 2018 |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete }}</ref> Every year more than 10 billion tonnes of concrete are used worldwide.<ref name=":2" /> In the coming years, large quantities of concrete will continue to be used, and the mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the sector will be even more critical.

Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to [[surface runoff]], which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding. [[Concrete dust]] released by building [[demolition]] and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous [[air pollution]]. Concrete is a contributor to the [[urban heat island]] effect, though less so than [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]].

===Concrete and climate change mitigation===
Reducing the cement clinker content might have positive effects on the environmental life-cycle assessment of concrete. Some research work on reducing the cement clinker content in concrete has already been carried out. However, there exist different research strategies. Often replacement of some clinker for large amounts of slag or fly ash was investigated based on conventional concrete technology. This could lead to a waste of scarce raw materials such as slag and fly ash. The aim of other research activities is the efficient use of cement and reactive materials like slag and fly ash in concrete based on a modified mix design approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Proske |first1=Tilo |last2=Hainer |first2=Stefan |last3=Rezvani |first3=Moien |last4=Graubner |first4=Carl-Alexander |title=Eco-friendly concretes with reduced water and cement contents – Mix design principles and laboratory tests |journal=Cement and Concrete Research |date=September 2013 |volume=51 |pages=38–46 |doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2013.04.011 }}</ref>

Studies have been conducted about commercialization of low-carbon concretes. [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) of low-carbon concrete was investigated according to the ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and fly ash (FA) replacement ratios. Global warming potential (GWP) of GGBS decreased by 1.1&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq/m<sup>3</sup>, while FA decreased by 17.3&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq/m<sup>3</sup> when the mineral admixture replacement ratio was increased by 10%. This study also compared the compressive strength properties of binary blended low-carbon concrete according to the replacement ratios, and the applicable range of mixing proportions was derived.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Jaehyun |last2=Lee |first2=Taegyu |last3=Jeong |first3=Jaewook |last4=Jeong |first4=Jaemin |title=Sustainability and performance assessment of binary blended low-carbon concrete using supplementary cementitious materials |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |date=January 2021 |volume=280 |pages=124373 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124373 |s2cid=224849505 }}</ref>

===Concrete and climate change adaptation===
High-performance building materials will be particularly important for enhancing resilience, including for flood defenses and critical-infrastructure protection. Risks to infrastructure and cities posed by extreme weather events are especially serious for those places exposed to flood and hurricane damage, but also where residents need protection from extreme summer temperatures. Traditional concrete can come under strain when exposed to humidity and higher concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. While concrete is likely to remain important in applications where the environment is challenging, novel, smarter and more adaptable materials are also needed.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=P.

===Recycling of concrete===
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

By far the most common method for recycling dry and hardened concrete involves crushing. Mobile sorters and crushers are often installed on construction sites to allow on-site processing. In other situations, specific processing sites are established, which are usually able to produce higher quality aggregate. Screens are used to achieve desired particle size, and remove dirt, foreign particles and fine material from the coarse aggregate.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title=How to Recycle |url=https://cdrecycling.org/materials/concrete/how-to-recycle/|access-date=2021-10-05 |publisher=Construction & Demolition Recycling Association}}</ref><ref name=":6">World Business Council for Sustainable Development, "The Cement Sustainability Initiative – Recycling concrete", available online at: www.wbcsdcement.org (last access on October 5th 2021)</ref>
