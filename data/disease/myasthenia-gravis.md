<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Myasthenia gravis''' ('''MG''') is a long-term [[neuromuscular junction disease]] that leads to varying degrees of skeletal [[muscle weakness]].<ref name="NIH2016" /> The most commonly affected muscles are those of the [[eye]]s, [[facial muscles|face]], and swallowing.<ref name="NIH2016" /><ref name="auto1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Salari N, Fatahi B, Bartina Y, Kazeminia M, Fatahian R, Mohammadi P, Shohaimi S, Mohammadi M | display-authors = 6 | title = Global prevalence of myasthenia gravis and the effectiveness of common drugs in its treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Translational Medicine | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 516 | date = December 2021 | pmid = 34930325 | pmc = 8686543 | doi = 10.1186/s12967-021-03185-7 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It can result in [[double vision]], [[drooping eyelid]]s, and difficulties in talking and walking.<ref name="NIH2016" /> Onset can be sudden.<ref name="NIH2016" /> Those affected often have a large [[thymus]] or develop a [[thymoma]].<ref name="NIH2016">{{cite web |title=Myasthenia Gravis Fact Sheet |url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Myasthenia-Gravis-Fact-Sheet |website=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The initial, main symptom in MG is painless [[Muscle weakness|weakness]] of specific muscles, not fatigue.<ref name="Engel2012">{{cite book|author=Engel AG|title=Myasthenia Gravis and Myasthenic Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V61KHl4T9vkC|edition=2nd|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|isbn=978-0-19-973867-0|pages=109–110|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908162031/https://books.google.com/books?id=V61KHl4T9vkC|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref> The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse ([[Muscle fatigue|fatigue]]) during periods of physical activity and improves after periods of rest.

===Eyes===
In about two-thirds of individuals, the initial symptom of MG is related to the muscles around the eye.<ref name="Engel2012" /> Eyelid drooping ([[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] may occur due to weakness of m. [[levator palpebrae superioris]])<ref name="Nair2014" /> and double vision ([[diplopia]],<ref name="Engel2012" /> due to weakness of the [[extraocular muscles]]).<ref name="Scully2014" /> Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television, reading, or driving, particularly in bright conditions.<ref name="Engel2012" /> Consequently, some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses.<ref name="Engel2012" /> The term "ocular myasthenia gravis" describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes, i.e. extraocular muscles, m. levator palpebrae superioris, and m. [[orbicularis oculi]].<ref name="Nair2014" /> Typically, this subtype evolves into generalized MG, usually after a few years.<ref name="Nair2014" />

===Eating===
The weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty ([[dysphagia]]). Typically, this means that some food may be left in the mouth after an attempt to swallow,<ref name="Scherer2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scherer K, Bedlack RS, Simel DL | title = Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 15 | pages = 1906–1914 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15840866 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.15.1906 }}</ref> or food and liquids may regurgitate into the nose rather than go down the throat ([[velopharyngeal insufficiency]]).<ref name="Scully2014" /> Weakness of the muscles that move the jaw ([[muscles of mastication]]) may cause difficulty chewing. In individuals with MG, chewing tends to become more tiring when chewing tough, fibrous foods.<ref name="Engel2012" /> Difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking is the first symptom in about one-sixth of individuals.<ref name="Engel2012" />

===Speaking===
Weakness of the muscles involved in speaking may lead to [[dysarthria]] and [[hypophonia]].<ref name="Engel2012" /> Speech may be slow and slurred,<ref name="Rajendran2014">{{cite book|author1=Rajendran A|author2=Sundaram S|title=Shafer's Textbook of Oral Pathology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WnhtAwAAQBAJ&pg=P867|edition=7th|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences APAC|isbn=978-81-312-3800-4|pages = 867|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091932/https://books.google.com/books?id=WnhtAwAAQBAJ&pg=P867|archive-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> or have a [[Nasality (disorder)|nasal quality]].<ref name="Scully2014" /> In some cases, a singing hobby or profession must be abandoned.<ref name="Scherer2005" />

===Head and neck===
Due to weakness of the [[muscles of facial expression]] and muscles of mastication, facial weakness may manifest as the inability to hold the mouth closed<ref name="Engel2012" /> (the "hanging jaw sign") and as a snarling expression when attempting to smile.<ref name="Scully2014" /> With drooping eyelids, facial weakness may make the individual appear sleepy or sad.<ref name="Engel2012" /> Difficulty in holding the head upright may occur.<ref name="Rajendran2014" />

===Other===
The [[Muscles of respiration|muscles that control breathing]] and limb movements can also be affected; rarely do these present as the first symptoms of MG, but develop over months to years.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000712|Myasthenia gravis}}</ref> In a myasthenic crisis, a [[paralysis]] of the respiratory muscles occurs, necessitating [[assisted ventilation]] to sustain life.<ref name="Rosen2014">{{cite book| vauthors = Marx JA |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4557-0605-1|pages=1441–1444 |edition=8th}}</ref> Crises may be triggered by various biological stressors such as infection, fever, an adverse reaction to medication, or emotional stress.<ref name="Rosen2014" />

==Pathophysiology==
MG is an [[autoimmune]] [[synaptopathy]]. The disorder occurs when the immune system malfunctions and generates antibodies that attack the body's tissues. The antibodies in MG attack a normal human protein, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, or a related protein called [[MuSK protein|MuSK]], a muscle-specific kinase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valenzuela DM, Stitt TN, DiStefano PS, Rojas E, Mattsson K, Compton DL, Nunez L, Park JS, Stark JL, Gies DR, Thomas S, LeBeau MM, Fernald AA, Copeland NG, Jenkins NA, Burden SJ, Glass DJ, Yancopoulos GD | title = Receptor tyrosine kinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury | journal = Neuron | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 573–584 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 7546737 | doi = 10.1016/0896-6273(95)90146-9 | s2cid = 17575761 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Myasthenia gravis|url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis|website = Genetics Home Reference|access-date = 2015-07-10|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150711123926/http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis|archive-date = 11 July 2015}}</ref> Other, less frequent antibodies are found against [[low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4|LRP4]], [[agrin]], and [[titin]] proteins.<ref name="Pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinmaz N, Nguyen T, Tea F, Dale RC, Brilot F | title = Mapping autoantigen epitopes: molecular insights into autoantibody-associated disorders of the nervous system | journal = Journal of Neuroinflammation | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 219 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27577085 | pmc = 5006540 | doi = 10.1186/s12974-016-0678-4 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

The thymus gland cells form part of the body's immune system. In those with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland is large and abnormal. It sometimes contains clusters of immune cells that indicate lymphoid hyperplasia, and the thymus gland may give wrong instructions to immune cells.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Myasthenia Gravis Fact Sheet|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/myasthenia_gravis/detail_myasthenia_gravis.htm|website = www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date = 2015-07-10|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150711193029/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/myasthenia_gravis/detail_myasthenia_gravis.htm|archive-date = 11 July 2015}}</ref>

===In pregnancy===
For women who are pregnant and already have MG, in a third of cases, they have been known to experience an exacerbation of their symptoms, and in those cases, it usually occurs in the [[first trimester]] of pregnancy.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Varner M | title = Myasthenia gravis and pregnancy | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 372–81 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23563874 | doi = 10.1097/GRF.0b013e31828e92c0 }}</ref> Signs and symptoms in pregnant mothers tend to improve during the [[second trimester|second]] and [[third trimester]]s.

This is due to maternal [[Antibody|antibodies]] that target an infant's acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the mother remains [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="OTM3"/>

==Diagnosis==
MG can be difficult to diagnose, as the symptoms can be subtle and hard to distinguish from both normal variants and other neurological disorders.<ref name="Scherer2005"/>

Three types of myasthenic symptoms in children can be distinguished:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Pediatric Nursing: The Critical Components of Nursing Care|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tlGAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA277|publisher = F.A.

When diagnosed with MG, a person is assessed for his or her neurological status and the level of illness is established. This is usually done using the accepted Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification scale.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Physical examination===
During a physical examination to check for MG, a doctor might ask the person to perform repetitive movements. For instance, the doctor may ask one to look at a fixed point for 30 seconds and to relax the muscles of the forehead, because a person with MG and ptosis of the eyes might be involuntarily using the forehead muscles to compensate for the weakness in the eyelids.<ref name="Scherer2005"/> The clinical examiner might also try to elicit the "curtain sign" in a person by holding one of the person's eyes open, which in the case of MG will lead the other eye to close.<ref name="Scherer2005"/>

===Blood tests===
If the diagnosis is suspected, [[serology]] can be performed:

Muscle fibers of people with MG are easily fatigued, which the [[repetitive nerve stimulation]] test can help diagnose. In single-fiber [[electromyography]], which is considered to be the most sensitive (although not the most specific) test for MG,<ref name="Scherer2005"/> a thin needle electrode is inserted into different areas of a particular muscle to record the action potentials from several samplings of different individual muscle fibers. Two muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit are identified, and the temporal variability in their firing patterns is measured. Frequency and proportion of particular abnormal action potential patterns, called "jitter" and "blocking", are diagnostic. Jitter refers to the abnormal variation in the time interval between action potentials of adjacent muscle fibers in the same motor unit. Blocking refers to the failure of nerve impulses to elicit action potentials in adjacent muscle fibers of the same motor unit.<ref name="Selvan">{{cite journal | vauthors = Selvan VA | title = Single-fiber EMG: A review | journal = Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–67 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21654930 | pmc = 3108086 | doi = 10.4103/0972-2327.78058 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Ice test===
Applying ice for 2–5 minutes to the muscles reportedly has a [[sensitivity and specificity]] of 76.9% and 98.3%, respectively, for the identification of MG. [[Acetylcholinesterase]] is thought to be inhibited at the lower temperature, which is the basis for this diagnostic test. This generally is performed on the eyelids when ptosis is present and is deemed positive if a ≥2-mm rise in the eyelid occurs after the ice is removed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kearsey C, Fernando P, D'Costa D, Ferdinand P | title = The use of the ice pack test in myasthenia gravis | journal = JRSM Short Reports | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | date = June 2010 | page = 14 | pmid = 21103106 | pmc = 2984327 | doi = 10.1258/shorts.2009.090037 }}</ref>

===Edrophonium test===
This test requires the [[intravenous]] administration of [[edrophonium|edrophonium chloride]] or neostigmine, drugs that block the breakdown of acetylcholine by [[cholinesterase]] (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003930|Tensilon test}}</ref> This test is no longer typically performed, as its use can lead to life-threatening [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate) which requires immediate emergency attention.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spillane J, Higham E, Kullmann DM | title = Myasthenia gravis | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue = dec21 3 | pages = e8497 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23261848 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e8497 | s2cid = 13911967 }}</ref> Production of edrophonium was discontinued in 2008.<ref name="Rosen2014" />

Other diseases that involve abnormal muscle fatigue (which may be described as exercise-induced muscle weakness, reversible muscle weakness, or muscle weakness that improves with rest) include: endocrine myopathies (such as [[Hoffmann syndrome|Hoffman syndrome]]), Tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM), [[ischemia]] (such as [[intermittent claudication]], [[popliteal artery entrapment syndrome]], and [[chronic venous insufficiency]]), and poor diet or malabsorption diseases that lead to [[vitamin D deficiency]] (osteomalic myopathy).

Signs and symptoms of myasthenia presenting from infancy or childhood may be one of the [[congenital myasthenic syndrome]]s, which can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or recessive manner. There are currently over two dozen types of congenital myasthenic syndromes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Phenotypic Series - PS601462, PS610542 - Congenital myasthenic syndromes - OMIM |url=https://www.omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS610542,PS601462 |access-date=2023-11-24 |website=www.omim.org}}</ref>

Limb–girdle myasthenia gravis  is a distinct condition from myasthenia gravis. It is an adult-onset, autoimmune condition affecting the neuromuscular junction. However, it lacks eye abnormalities and is associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and thymoma.<ref>{{Cite web |title=159400 - MYASTHENIA, LIMB-GIRDLE, AUTOIMMUNE - OMIM |url=https://www.omim.org/entry/159400 |access-date=2024-02-29 |website=www.omim.org |language=en-us}}</ref>

[[Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (LEMS) is an autoimmune condition that attacks the neuromuscular junction, either as a paraneoplastic syndrome (typically older patients) or associated with a non-cancerous primary autoimmune condition (typically younger patients). It usually involves lower limb weakness and exercise-induced fatiguability, although the upper limbs and eyes may also be involved. Lambert's sign is the unusual improvement of grip strength that follows after squeezing the hand at maximum intensity for 2-3 seconds.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pascuzzi |first1=Robert M. |last2=Bodkin |first2=Cynthia L. |date=2022 |title=Myasthenia Gravis and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome: New Developments in Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=18 |pages=3001–3022 |doi=10.2147/NDT.S296714 |doi-access=free |issn=1176-6328 |pmc=9792103 |pmid=36578903}}</ref>

====Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors====
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can provide symptomatic benefit and may not fully remove a person's weakness from MG.<ref name="Mehndiratta_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehndiratta MM, Pandey S, Kuntzer T | title = Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD006986 | date = October 2014 | volume = 2014 | pmid = 25310725 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006986.pub3 | pmc = 7390275 }}</ref> While they might not fully remove all symptoms of MG, they still may allow a person the ability to perform normal daily activities.<ref name="Mehndiratta_2014" /> Usually, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are started at a low dose and increased until the desired result is achieved. If taken 30 minutes before a meal, symptoms will be mild during eating, which is helpful for those who have difficulty swallowing due to their illness. Another medication used for MG, [[atropine]], can reduce the muscarinic side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Atropine – Myasthenia-gravis medicines and drugs |url = http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Myasthenia-gravis&medicine=Atropine|date = 2014|access-date = 2015-07-11|publisher= NHS Choices|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150712212657/http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Myasthenia-gravis&medicine=Atropine|archive-date = 12 July 2015}}</ref> [[Pyridostigmine]] is a relatively long-acting drug (when compared to other cholinergic agonists), with a half-life around four hours with relatively few side effects.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar V, Kaminski HJ | title = Treatment of myasthenia gravis | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–96 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20927659 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-010-0151-1 | s2cid = 41052495 }}</ref> Generally, it is discontinued in those who are being mechanically ventilated, as it is known to increase the amount of salivary secretions.<ref name=":1" /> A few high-quality studies have directly compared cholinesterase inhibitors with other treatments (or placebo); their practical benefit may be so significant that conducting studies in which they would be withheld from some people would be difficult.<ref name="auto"/>

===Plasmapheresis and IVIG===
If the myasthenia is serious (myasthenic crisis), [[plasmapheresis]] can be used to remove the putative antibodies from the circulation. Also, [[intravenous immunoglobulin]]s (IVIGs) can be used to bind the circulating antibodies. Both of these treatments have relatively short-lived benefits, typically measured in weeks, and often are associated with high costs, which make them prohibitive; they are generally reserved for when MG requires hospitalization.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Juel2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Juel VC | title = Myasthenia gravis: management of myasthenic crisis and perioperative care | journal = Seminars in Neurology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–81 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15229794 | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-829595 | s2cid = 260320936 }}</ref>

As [[thymoma]]s are seen in 10% of all people with the MG, they are often given a chest X-ray and CT scan to evaluate their need for surgical removal of their thymus glands and any cancerous tissue that may be present.<ref name="Rosen2014" /><ref name=":2" /> Even if surgery is performed to remove a thymoma, it generally does not lead to the remission of MG.<ref name=":1" /> Surgery in the case of MG involves the removal of the thymus, although in 2013, no clear benefit was indicated except in the presence of a thymoma.<ref name="Cea2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cea G, Benatar M, Verdugo RJ, Salinas RA | title = Thymectomy for non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD008111 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24122674 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008111.pub2 | doi-access =  }}</ref> A 2016 randomized, controlled trial, however, found some benefits.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe GI, Kaminski HJ, Aban IB, Minisman G, Kuo HC, Marx A, Ströbel P, Mazia C, Oger J, Cea JG, Heckmann JM, Evoli A, Nix W, Ciafaloni E, Antonini G, Witoonpanich R, King JO, Beydoun SR, Chalk CH, Barboi AC, Amato AA, Shaibani AI, Katirji B, Lecky BR, Buckley C, Vincent A, Dias-Tosta E, Yoshikawa H, Waddington-Cruz M, Pulley MT, Rivner MH, Kostera-Pruszczyk A, Pascuzzi RM, Jackson CE, Garcia Ramos GS, Verschuuren JJ, Massey JM, Kissel JT, Werneck LC, Benatar M, Barohn RJ, Tandan R, Mozaffar T, Conwit R, Odenkirchen J, Sonett JR, Jaretzki A, Newsom-Davis J, Cutter GR | display-authors = 6 | title = Randomized Trial of Thymectomy in Myasthenia Gravis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 375 | issue = 6 | pages = 511–522 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27509100 | pmc = 5189669 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1602489 | hdl = 2318/1601939 }}</ref>

===Physical measures===
People with MG should be educated regarding the fluctuating nature of their symptoms, including weakness and exercise-induced fatigue. Exercise participation should be encouraged with frequent rest.<ref name="Goldenberg" /> In people with generalized MG, some evidence indicates a partial home program including training in [[diaphragmatic breathing]], [[pursed-lip breathing]], and interval-based muscle therapy may improve respiratory muscle strength, chest wall mobility, respiratory pattern, and respiratory endurance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cup EH, Pieterse AJ, Ten Broek-Pastoor JM, Munneke M, van Engelen BG, Hendricks HT, van der Wilt GJ, Oostendorp RA | title = Exercise therapy and other types of physical therapy for patients with neuromuscular diseases: a systematic review | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 88 | issue = 11 | pages = 1452–1464 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17964887 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2007.07.024 }}</ref>

===Medical imaging===
In people with myasthenia gravis, older forms of [[iodinated contrast]] used for medical imaging have caused an increased risk of exacerbation of the disease, but modern forms have no immediate increased risk.<ref name="MehriziPascuzzi2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehrizi M, Pascuzzi RM | title = Complications of radiologic contrast in patients with myasthenia gravis | journal = Muscle & Nerve | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 443–4 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24677227 | doi = 10.1002/mus.24254 | s2cid = 206295540 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of people with MG is generally good, as is quality of life, when given very good treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sieb JP | title = Myasthenia gravis: an update for the clinician | journal = Clinical and Experimental Immunology | volume = 175 | issue = 3 | pages = 408–418 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24117026 | pmc = 3927901 | doi = 10.1111/cei.12217 }}</ref> Monitoring of a person with MG is very important, as at least 20% of people diagnosed with it will experience a myasthenic crisis within two years of their diagnosis, requiring rapid medical intervention.<ref name=":1" /> Generally, the most disabling period of MG might be years after the initial diagnosis.<ref name="Mehndiratta_2014" /> Assistive devices may be needed to assist with mobility.<ref name="NIH2016" />   In the early 1900s, 70% of detected cases died from lung problems; now, that number is estimated to be around 3–5%, an improvement attributed to increased awareness and medications to manage symptoms.<ref name=":1" />

==Epidemiology==
MG occurs in all ethnic groups and both sexes. It most commonly affects women under 40 and people from 50 to 70 years old of either sex, but it has been known to occur at any age. Younger people rarely have thymoma. [[Prevalence]] in the United States is estimated at between 0.5 and 20.4 cases per 100,000, with an estimated 60,000 Americans affected.<ref name="Rosen2014" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cea G, Benatar M, Verdugo RJ, Salinas RA | title = Thymectomy for non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD008111 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24122674 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008111.pub2| doi-access =  }}</ref> In the United Kingdom, an estimated 15 cases of MG occur per 100,000 people.<ref name=":2" />

==History==
The first to write about MG were [[Thomas Willis]], [[Samuel Wilks]], Erb, and Goldflam.<ref name="Nair2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair AG, Patil-Chhablani P, Venkatramani DV, Gandhi RA | title = Ocular myasthenia gravis: a review | journal = Indian Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 985–991 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25449931 | pmc = 4278125 | doi = 10.4103/0301-4738.145987 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The term "myasthenia gravis pseudo-paralytica" was proposed in 1895 by Jolly, a German physician.<ref name="Nair2014" /> [[Mary Broadfoot Walker|Mary Walker]] treated a person with MG with [[physostigmine]] in 1934.<ref name="Nair2014" /> Simpson and Nastuck detailed the autoimmune nature of the condition.<ref name="Nair2014" /> In 1973, Patrick and Lindstrom used rabbits to show that immunization with purified muscle-like acetylcholine receptors caused the development of MG-like symptoms.<ref name="Nair2014" />

==Research==
Immunomodulating substances, such as drugs that prevent acetylcholine receptor modulation by the immune system, are currently being researched.<ref name="Losen2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Losen M, Martínez-Martínez P, Phernambucq M, Schuurman J, Parren PW, De Baets MH | title = Treatment of myasthenia gravis by preventing acetylcholine receptor modulation | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1132 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–179 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18567867 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1405.034 | bibcode = 2008NYASA1132..174L | s2cid = 3206109 }}</ref> Some research recently has been on [[Complement component 5|anti-c5 inhibitors]] for treatment research as they are safe and used in the treatment of other diseases.<ref name="auto2"/> [[Ephedrine]] seems to benefit some people more than other medications, but it has not been properly studied as of 2014.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vrinten C, van der Zwaag AM, Weinreich SS, Scholten RJ, Verschuuren JJ | title = Ephedrine for myasthenia gravis, neonatal myasthenia and the congenital myasthenic syndromes | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2014 | issue = 12 | pages = CD010028 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25515947 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010028.pub2| pmc = 7387729 }}</ref>
In the laboratory, MG is mostly studied in model organisms, such as rodents. In addition, in 2015, scientists developed an ''in vitro'' functional, all-human, [[neuromuscular junction]] assay from human [[embryonic stem cell]]s and somatic-muscle stem cells. After the addition of pathogenic antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor and activation of the [[complement system]], the neuromuscular co-culture shows symptoms such as weaker muscle contractions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steinbeck JA, Jaiswal MK, Calder EL, Kishinevsky S, Weishaupt A, Toyka KV, Goldstein PA, Studer L | title = Functional Connectivity under Optogenetic Control Allows Modeling of Human Neuromuscular Disease | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 134–143 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26549107 | pmc = 4707991 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2015.10.002 }}</ref>
