'''Horner's syndrome''', also known as '''oculosympathetic paresis''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000708.htm|title=Horner syndrome: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of [[nerve]]s known as the [[sympathetic trunk]] is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a [[lesion]] of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by [[miosis]] (a constricted [[pupil]]), partial [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent [[anhidrosis]] (decreased sweating), with apparent [[enophthalmos]] (inset [[eyeball]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/horner-syndrome|title=Horner syndrome|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>

The nerves of the sympathetic trunk arise from the [[spinal cord]] in the [[thorax|chest]], and from there ascend to the neck and face. The nerves are part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], a division of the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] (or involuntary) nervous system. Once the syndrome has been recognized, [[medical imaging]] and response to particular [[eye drop]]s may be required to identify the location of the problem and the underlying cause.<ref name=Ropper>{{cite book |veditors=Ropper AH, Brown RH | title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology | edition=8th |vauthors=Ropper AH, Brown RH | chapter=14: disorders of ocular movement and pupillary function | year=2005 | pages=222–45 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | location=New York | isbn=0-07-141620-X }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs that are found in people with Horner's syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following:
* [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (drooping of the upper eyelid)<ref name=Ropper/>
* [[anhidrosis]] (decreased sweating)<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6670/horners-syndrome|title=Horner's syndrome {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>
* [[miosis]] (constriction of the pupil)<ref name=":1" />
* [[Enophthalmos]] (sinking of the eyeball into the face)<ref name=":1" />
* inability to completely close or open the eyelid<ref name=":1" />
* facial flushing<ref name=":1" />
* headaches<ref name=":1" />
* loss of [[ciliospinal reflex]]
* [[Red eye (medicine)|bloodshot]] [[conjunctiva]], depending on the site of lesion.
* unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner's syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases.
* [[heterochromia iridum]] (in congenital Horner's syndrome)<ref name=":1" />

Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the [[dilator muscle]] and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the [[superior tarsal muscle]] which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not always the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present. The phenomenon of enophthalmos is seen in Horner's syndrome in cats, rats, and dogs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Daroff R | title = Enophthalmos is not present in Horner syndrome | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = e120 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15839747 | pmc = 1087222 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020120 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Sometimes there is [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]] on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin.  The pupil's light reflex is maintained as this is controlled via the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

In children, Horner's syndrome sometimes leads to [[heterochromia]], a difference in eye color between the two eyes.<ref name=Ropper/> This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with [[melanin]] pigmentation of the [[melanocyte]]s in the superficial [[stroma of iris|stroma]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

In veterinary medicine, signs can include partial closure of the third eyelid, or [[nictitating membrane]].{{cn|date=August 2021}}

==Causes==
[[File:Horner's Syndrome and Autonomic innervation of the eye.svg|thumb|right|450px|Scheme showing sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the pupil and sites of a lesion in Horner's syndrome.]]
Horner's syndrome is usually acquired as a result of disease, but may also be [[congenital]] (inborn, associated with heterochromatic iris) or [[iatrogenic]] (caused by medical treatment). In rare cases, Horner's syndrome may be the result of repeated, minor head trauma, such as being hit with a soccer ball.  Although most causes are relatively benign, Horner's syndrome may reflect serious disease in the neck or chest (such as a [[Pancoast tumor]] (tumor in the apex of the lung) or thyrocervical venous dilatation).{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Causes can be divided according to the presence and location of anhidrosis:{{cn|date=August 2021}}
* Central (anhidrosis of face, arm and trunk)
** [[Syringomyelia]]
** [[Multiple sclerosis]]
** [[Encephalitis]]
** [[Brain tumors]]
** [[Lateral medullary syndrome]]
* [[Preganglionic]] (anhidrosis of face)
** [[Cervical rib]] traction on stellate ganglion
** [[Thyroid carcinoma]]
** [[Thyroidectomy]]
** [[Goiter]]
** [[Bronchogenic carcinoma]] of the superior fissure ([[Pancoast tumor]]) on apex of lung
** [[Klumpke paralysis]]
** [[Physical trauma|Trauma]] - base of neck, usually blunt trauma, sometimes surgery.
** As a complication of [[tube thoracostomy]]
** [[Thoracic aortic aneurysm]]
* [[Postganglionic]] (no anhidrosis)
** [[Cluster headache]] - combination termed Horton's headache
** An episode of Horner's syndrome may occur during a [[migraine]] attack and be relieved afterwards<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laing C, Thomas DJ, Mathias CJ, Unwin RJ | title = Headache, hypertension and Horner's syndrome | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 93 | issue = 10 | pages = 535–6 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11064693 | pmc = 1298129 | doi = 10.1177/014107680009301010 }}.</ref>
** [[Cavernous sinus thrombosis]]
** [[Middle ear infection]]
* [[Sympathectomy]]
* [[Nerve block]]s, such as cervical plexus block, stellate ganglion or interscalene block

== Pathophysiology ==
Horner syndrome is due to a deficiency of [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] activity.
The site of lesion to the sympathetic outflow is on the [[ipsilateral]] side of the symptoms.
The following are examples of conditions that cause the clinical appearance of Horner's syndrome:<ref name=":2" />
* First-order neuron disorder: Central lesions that involve the [[hypothalamospinal tract]] (e.g. transection of the cervical spinal cord).
* Second-order neuron disorder: [[Preganglionic]] lesions (e.g. compression of the sympathetic chain by a lung tumor) that releases acetylcholine.
* Third-order neuron disorder: [[Postganglionic]] lesions at the level of the internal carotid artery (e.g. a tumor in the [[cavernous sinus]] or a carotid artery dissection) that releases norepinephrine.
* Partial Horner's syndrome: In case of a third-neuron disorder, anhidrosis is limited to the middle part of the forehead or can be absent, resulting in a partial Horner's syndrome.<ref name="Lee">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JH, Lee HK, Lee DH, Choi CG, Kim SJ, Suh DC | title = Neuroimaging strategies for three types of Horner syndrome with emphasis on anatomic location | journal = AJR. American Journal of Roentgenology | volume = 188 | issue = 1 | pages = W74-81 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17179330 | doi = 10.2214/AJR.05.1588 }}</ref>

If patients have impaired sweating above the waist affecting only one side of the body, and they  do not have clinically apparent Horner's syndrome, then their lesions are just below the [[stellate ganglion]] in the sympathetic chain.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Example of Horner's syndrome in a cat.jpg|thumb|Left-sided Horner's syndrome in a cat as a result of trauma, demonstrating miosis in left pupil.]]
Three tests are useful in confirming the presence and severity of Horner syndrome:
* Cocaine drop test: [[Cocaine]] eyedrops block the reuptake of post-ganglionic [[norepinephrine]] resulting in the [[mydriasis|dilation]] of a normal pupil from retention of norepinephrine in the synapse. However, in Horner's syndrome the lack of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft causes [[mydriasis|mydriatic]] failure.  A more recently introduced approach that is more dependable and obviates the difficulties in obtaining cocaine is to apply the alpha-agonist [[apraclonidine]] to both eyes and observe the increased mydriatic effect (due to hypersensitivity) on the affected side of Horner syndrome (the opposite effect to what the cocaine test would produce in the presence of Horner's).<ref name=":2">{{Citation |last=Koka |first=Kirthi |title=Ptosis Correction |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539828/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2024-01-04 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=30969650 |last2=Patel |first2=Bhupendra C.}}</ref>
* [[p-Hydroxyamphetamine|Paredrine]] test: This test helps to localize the cause of the miosis. If the third order neuron (the last of three neurons in the pathway which ultimately discharges norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft) is intact, then the amphetamine causes neurotransmitter vesicle release, thus releasing norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft and resulting in robust mydriasis of the affected pupil. If the lesion itself is of the third order neuron, then the amphetamine will have no effect and the pupil remains constricted. There is no pharmacological test to differentiate between a first and second order neuron lesion.<ref name="Lee"/>
* Dilation lag test{{Clarify|date=July 2013}}

It is important to distinguish the [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] caused by Horner's syndrome from the ptosis caused by a lesion to the [[oculomotor nerve]]. In the former, the ptosis occurs with a constricted pupil (due to a loss of sympathetics to the eye), whereas in the latter, the ptosis occurs with a dilated pupil (due to a loss of innervation to the [[sphincter pupillae]]).  In a clinical setting, these two ptoses are fairly easy to distinguish.  In addition to the blown pupil in a CNIII ([[oculomotor nerve]]) lesion, this ptosis is much more severe, occasionally occluding the whole eye.  The ptosis of Horner syndrome can be quite mild or barely noticeable (partial ptosis).<ref name=":2" />

When [[anisocoria]] occurs and the examiner is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, if a one-sided ptosis is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be presumed to be on the side of the ptosis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==History==
The syndrome is [[eponym|named after]] [[Johann Friedrich Horner]], the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] who first described the syndrome in 1869.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Horner JF | title=Über eine Form von Ptosis | journal=Klin Monatsbl Augenheilk | year=1869 | volume=7 | pages=193–8}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1056}}</ref> Several others had previously described cases, but "Horner's syndrome" is most prevalent. In [[France]] and [[Italy]], [[Claude Bernard]] is also eponymized with the condition (Claude Bernard–Horner syndrome, abbreviated CBH<ref>{{Cite book|title=Logan's Medical and Scientific Abbreviations|url=https://archive.org/details/logansmedicalsci00loga|url-access=registration|last1=Logan|first1=Carolynn M.|last2=Rice|first2=M.

In France, Francois Pourfour du Petit is also credited with describing this syndrome.

== Children ==
The most common causes in young children are [[birth trauma (physical)|birth trauma]] and a type of cancer called [[neuroblastoma]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book | title = Neuro-ophthalmology: Handbook of Clinical Neurology (Series Editors: Aminoff, Boller and Swaab) | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5wgMetZtk0sC&pg=PA452 |publisher = Elsevier|date = 2011-06-28|isbn = 9780702045479|first1 = Christopher|last1 = Kennard|first2 = R.
