The '''Bulldog''' is a British [[dog breed|breed]] of dog of [[mastiff]] type. It may also be known as the '''English Bulldog''' or '''British Bulldog'''. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around {{convert|40|-|55|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. They have large heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding for its distinctive appearance, including [[Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome|brachycephaly]], [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], heat sensitivity, and skin infections. Due to concerns about their quality of life, breeding Bulldogs is illegal in Norway and the Netherlands.

The modern Bulldog was bred as a [[companion dog]] from the [[Old English Bulldog]], a now-extinct breed used for [[bull-baiting]] when the sport was outlawed in England under the Cruelty to Animals Act. The Bulldog Club (In England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890. While often used as a symbol of ferocity and courage, modern Bulldogs are generally friendly, amiable dogs. Bulldogs are now commonly kept as pets; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered worldwide.{{r|skk}}

The designation "bull" was applied because of the dog's use in the sport of [[bull-baiting]]. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling over them.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bulldog origin |url=https://www.nebkc.com/bulldog-origin-1 |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=NEBKC |language=en}}</ref> Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed, as well as a ferocious and savage temperament.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bulldog origin |url=https://www.nebkc.com/bulldog-origin-1 |access-date=2024-02-20 |website=NEBKC |language=en}}</ref> Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Curnutt |first1=Jordan |title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook |date=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=284 |isbn=9781576071472 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC |access-date=13 September 2020 |archive-date=21 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230121213803/https://books.google.com/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC |url-status=live }}</ref> Therefore, the [[Old English Bulldog]] had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its "working" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor [[Richard Nicolls]]. Because cornering and leading wild bulls was dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.<ref>Ellis, Edward Robb (2005).

In 1864, a group of Bulldog breeders under R. S. Rockstro founded the first Bulldog Club. Three years after its opening the Club ceased to exist, not having organized a single show. The main achievement of the Rockstro Bulldog Club was a detailed description of the Bulldog, known as the Philo-Kuan Standard. Samuel Wickens, treasurer of the club, published this description in 1865 under the pseudonym Philo-Kuan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Origin of the English Bulldog Standard|url=http://www.bulldoginformation.com/standardorigin.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312110236/http://bulldoginformation.com:80/standardorigin.html |archive-date=12 March 2004 |accessdate=2021-02-02|website=Bulldog Information|language=en}}</ref>{{bettersourceneeded|date=February 2024}}

On 4 April 1873, [[The Kennel Club]] was founded, the first dog breeding club dealing with the registration of purebred dogs and dog breeds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the Kennel Club|url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/about-us/about-the-kennel-club/history-of-the-kennel-club/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918110844/https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/about-us/about-the-kennel-club/history-of-the-kennel-club/ |archive-date=18 September 2020 |accessdate=2021-02-02|website=The Kennel Club}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=February 2024}} Bulldogs were included in the first volume of the Kennel Club Stud Book, which was presented at the Birmingham Show on 1 December 1874.

The founders of the club collected all available information about the breed and its best representatives and developed a new standard for the English Bulldog, which was published on 27 May 1875, the same year they held the first breed show. Since 1878, exhibitions of the club were held annually, except during the [[Second World War]]. On 17 May 1894, the Bulldog Club was granted the status of a corporation and since then has carried the official name "The Bulldog Club, Inc.".

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
[[File:Female English Bulldog.jpg|thumb|A 4-year-old Bulldog of Champion bloodlines, side view. Note the "rope" over the nose, and pronounced underbite]]

Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular [[prognathism]]. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, [[brindle]], and [[piebald]].<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" /> They have short tails that can either hang down straight or be tucked in a coiled "corkscrew" into a tail pocket.

=== Temperament ===
[[File:Clyde The Bulldog.jpg|thumb|Six-month-old Bulldog puppy from [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] Champion bloodlines]]
According to the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be "equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanour should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behaviour".<ref name="AKC Bulldog Page">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/bulldog/ American Kennel Club â€“ Bulldog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813002750/http://www.akc.org/breeds/bulldog/ |date=13 August 2012 }}.

A British study found [[demodicosis]] to be more prevalent in the Bulldog than other breeds. The overall prevalence was 1.5% in the breed compared to the 0.17% rate for all dogs.

=== Controversies and legal status ===
In January 2009, after the BBC documentary ''[[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]'', [[The Kennel Club]] introduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders.<ref name="Time14Jan09Bulldog">{{cite news |author=Elliott, Valerie |date=14 January 2009 |title=Healthier new Bulldog will lose its Churchillian jowl |work=The Times |location=London |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5512620.ece |access-date=14 January 2009 |archive-date=16 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116003604/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5512620.ece |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2019 the [[Dutch Kennel Club]] implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1 km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes. Its temperature and heart rate have to recover after 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convenant Bulldog, breeding rules|url=http://www.raadvanbeheer.nl/uploads/media/Convenant_Bulldog-breeding_rules.pdf|publisher=Raad van Beheer (Dutch Kennel Club)|access-date=30 June 2014|archive-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083847/http://www.raadvanbeheer.nl/uploads/media/Convenant_Bulldog-breeding_rules.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bulldogs are often associated with determination, strength, and courage due to their historical occupation, though the modern-day dog is bred for appearance and friendliness and not suited for significant physical exertion. They are [[list of bulldog mascots|often used as mascots]] by universities, sports teams, and other organizations. Some of the better-known Bulldog mascots include Georgetown's [[Jack the Bulldog|Jack]], Butler's [[Butler Blue|Blue IV]], Yale's [[Handsome Dan]], the University of Georgia's [[Uga (mascot)|Uga]], Mississippi State's [[Bully (mascot)|Bully]], and the United States Marine Corps' [[Chesty XV|Chesty]].<ref name=":0">Denizet-Lewis, Benoit (22 November 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/can-the-bulldog-be-saved.html Can the Bulldog be Saved?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210313195349/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/can-the-bulldog-be-saved.html |date=13 March 2021 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Anna |last=Burke |date=May 25, 2018 |title=The Legacy of Chesty: How a Bulldog Became the United States Marine Corps Mascot |url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/marine-corps-bulldog-chesty/ |access-date=2023-01-18 |website=American Kennel Club |language=en |archive-date=18 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118230714/https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/marine-corps-bulldog-chesty/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
