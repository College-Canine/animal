The '''German Shepherd''',{{efn|name=a}} also known in Britain as an '''Alsatian''', is a German [[dog breed|breed]] of [[working dog]] of medium to large size. The breed was developed by [[Max von Stephanitz]] using various [[Old German herding dogs|traditional German herding dogs]] from 1899.

It was originally bred as a [[herding dog]], for herding [[sheep]]. It has since been used in many other types of work, including [[assistance dog|disability assistance]], [[search-and-rescue]], [[police dog|police work]], and [[dogs in warfare|warfare]]. It is commonly kept as a [[companion dog]], and according to the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.{{r|skk}}

[[File:German Shepherd Portrait.jpg|thumb|Illustration from 1909]]
During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.<ref name=gsd-history>{{cite web |title=History of the breed |website=German Shepherds.com |date=30 December 2007 |url=http://www.germanshepherds.com/thegsd/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601121843/http://www.germanshepherds.com/thegsd/history/ |archive-date=1 June 2008}}</ref> Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.<ref name=gsd-history/>

To combat these differences, the [[Phylax Society]] was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.{{sfnp|Rice|1999|p=11}} While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.

With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} [[Max von Stephanitz]], an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}}

In 1899, von&nbsp;Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von&nbsp;Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.<ref name=gsd-history/> After purchasing the dog he changed his name to [[Horand von Grafrath]] and von&nbsp;Stephanitz founded the [[Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde]] (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).<ref name=gsd-history/> Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} In just a few decades of the {{Lang|de|Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde|italic=no}}'s establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the {{Lang|de|Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde|italic=no}} claimed 50,000&nbsp;dues-paying members in more than 500&nbsp;branches in Germany alone.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Skabelund |first=Aaron |date=June 2008 |title=Breeding racism: The imperial battlefields of the 'German' shepherd dog |journal=Society and Animals |volume=16 |issue=4 |page=355 |doi=10.1163/156853008X357676 |url=https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/skabelund.pdf |via=AnimalsAndSociety.org}}</ref>

Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Württemberg]].{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}}{{sfnp|Stevens|2002|p=11}} Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84&nbsp;pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von&nbsp;Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.{{sfnp|Willis|1976|p=5}}

During the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.<ref name=":0"/> German Shepherds were coveted as "{{lang|de|germanische Urhunde}}", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.<ref name=":4">{{cite book |last=Sax |first=Boria |year=2000 |title=Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, scapegoats, and the holocaust |others=Foreword by Klaus P.

=== Naming ===

[[File:German Shepherds in ravine.jpg|thumb|Sable bitch (left) and dog (right)]]

The breed was named {{Lang|de|Deutscher Schäferhund}}, by von Stephanitz, translating to "German Shepherd Dog".{{r|fci}} At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as {{Lang|de|Altdeutsche Schäferhunde}}, or [[old German herding dogs]].

The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the [[stud-book]]; however, at the end of the [[First World War]], it was believed that the inclusion of the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,<ref name="palika-22">{{Cite book|last=Palika|first=Liz|year=2008|title=Your Happy Healthy Pet: German Shepherd Dog|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|isbn=978-0-470-19231-3|page=22}}</ref> due to the [[Anti-German sentiment#First World War|anti-German sentiment]] of the era.{{sfnp|Rice|1999|p=12}} The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",<ref name="palika-22" /> after the French region of [[Alsace]] bordering Germany.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}}

Eventually,{{when|date=February 2022}} the appendage "wolf dog" was dropped,<ref name="palika-22" /> after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a [[wolf-dog hybrid]] would affect the breed's popularity and legality.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}} The name Alsatian remained for five decades,<ref name="palika-22" /> until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.<ref name="Jewish-culture">{{cite web|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/weekly/german_shepherds.htm |title=German Shepherd&nbsp;– The Ultimate Service Dog |access-date=15 July 2008 |website=German Culture}}</ref> The word "Alsatian" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/3367/23/5/3 |title=Change of Name&nbsp;– German Shepherd Dog |date=19 October 2010 |website=The Kennel Club |access-date=22 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027170852/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/3367/23/5/3 |archive-date=27 October 2010 }}</ref>

Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to {{frac|8|1|2}}. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.<ref name="akc-index" /> They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the [[Hock (zoology)|hock]].<ref name="ukkc" />

German Shepherds have a double [[Coat (dog)|coat]] which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is [[Recessive gene|recessive]], and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the [[German Kennel Club|German]] and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.<ref name="ukkc" /><ref name="akc-index" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vdh.de/rasse_beschreibung/159/ |title=Rasse-Lexikon Deutscher Schäferhund |access-date=15 July 2008 |website=Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen |language=de| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090825095432/http://www.vdh.de/rasse_beschreibung/159/ | archive-date = 25 August 2009}}</ref> The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vonziugermanshepherds.com/gsd-info.html |title=GSD Info |website=Vonziü German Shepherds |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106132534/https://www.vonziugermanshepherds.com/gsd-info.html |archive-date=6 November 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=6 July 2017 }}</ref>

Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have [[melanistic mask|black masks]] and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, [[White Shepherd|pure-white]], liver, silver, blue, and [[Panda German Shepherds|panda]] varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.<ref name="akc-index">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepherd_dog/index.cfm |title=German Shepherd Dog Breed Standard |access-date=15 July 2008 |website=American Kennel Club }}</ref>

=== Intelligence ===

German Shepherds were bred specifically for their [[Dog intelligence|intelligence]].{{sfnp|von Stephanitz|1994|p=12}} In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, [[Stanley Coren]] ranked the breed in second place.<ref name=coren>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/intelligenceofdo00core|title=The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of our Canine Companions|first=Stanley|last=Coren|author-link=Stanley Coren|date=1995|page=134|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=0553374524}}</ref> Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as [[Police dog|police]], [[Guard dog|guard]] and [[search and rescue dog]]s, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitepawsgsr.com/breed.html |title=About the Breed |access-date=15 July 2008 |website=White Paws: German Shepherd |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829164852/http://whitepawsgsr.com/breed.html |archive-date=29 August 2008 }}</ref>

== Temperament ==

[[File:Infant with two German Shepherds.JPG|thumb|A human infant with two dogs]]
German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.<ref name="akc-index" /> The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsdca.org/german-shepherd-dogs/training-puppy-tips|title=German Shepherd Dog and Puppy Training Tips from the German Shepherd Dog Club of America|website=gsdca.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-02|archive-date=3 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303050729/https://www.gsdca.org/german-shepherd-dogs/training-puppy-tips|url-status=dead}}</ref> They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/br528.html |website=New Zealand Kennel Club |title=Breed Standard&nbsp;— German Shepherd |access-date=19 July 2008 |quote=While the dog should be approachable and friendly, he does not make immediate friendships with strangers. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720164714/http://www.nzkc.org.nz/br528.html |archive-date=20 July 2008 }}</ref> German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.<ref>Dogwise: The Natural way to Train your Dog (1992), John Fisher Souvenir Press Ltd. {{ISBN|0-285-63114-4}}</ref>

A 2020 literature review in ''[[Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery]]'' found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.<ref name="Bailey">{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=Chad M. |last2=Hinchcliff |first2=Katharine M. |last3=Moore |first3=Zachary |last4=Pu |first4=Lee L.Q. |title=Dog Bites in the United States from 1971 to 2018: A Systematic Review of the Peer-Reviewed Literature |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |date=November 2020 |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=1166–1176 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0000000000007253|pmid=33136964 |s2cid=225080998 }}</ref>

[[The Kennel Club]], in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.<ref name="thekennelclub.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=2926 |title=German Shepherd Dogs – The Soundness Issue |website=The Kennel Club |date=8 February 2010 |access-date=2 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501104611/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=2926 |archive-date=1 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=KC confirms position on German Shepherds|url=http://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2010/Feb2010/News190210/gsd.htm|website=Our Dogs-UK|access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref> Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.

The issue was raised in the BBC documentary, ''[[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]'', which said that critics of the breed describe it as "half dog, half frog". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were "not normal".

The Kennel Club's position is that "this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement."<ref name="thekennelclub.org.uk"/> The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=2942 |title=German Shepherd Dogs – Judges Training Programme |website=The Kennel Club |date=16 February 2010 |access-date=2 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019060222/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=2942 |archive-date=19 October 2011 }}</ref>

{{main|East-European Shepherd}}
[[File:Vostochno Evropeiskaya Ovcharka.jpg|thumb|upright|East-European Shepherd]]
The East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former [[Soviet Union]] with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.{{sfnp|Hancock|2014|pp=14 & 28}}

=== King Shepherd ===

The King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.{{sfnp|Hancock|2014|pp=14 & 140}}

=== Shiloh Shepherd ===
[[File:Shiloh Shepherd Dog Profile.jpg|thumb|upright|Shiloh Shepherd]]
The Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.{{sfnp|Hancock|2014|pp=14, 140 & 222}}{{sfnp|Fogle|2009|p=387}} It has been recognised since 1990 by the [[American Rare Breed Association]].<ref name="ARBA">{{cite web |url=https://www.arba.org/Pages/gallery-group-1-breeds.htm|title=Group 1 Breeds |publisher=American Rare Breed Association |access-date=14 March 2020}}</ref>

=== White Shepherd ===
{{main|White Shepherd}}
[[File:Kandestack 62406.jpg|thumb|upright|White Shepherd]]
The White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the [[United Kennel Club]].{{sfnp|Pickeral|2014}}

=== White Swiss Shepherd Dog ===

The White Swiss Shepherd Dog ({{lang-fr|Berger Blanc Suisse}}, {{lang-de|Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund}}, {{lang-it|Pastore Svizzero Bianco}}) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national [[kennel club]]s.{{sfnp|Pickeral|2014}}

== Use as a working dog ==

German Shepherds are a popular selection for use as [[working dog]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.countrylife.co.uk/out-and-about/dogs/how-to-choose-the-perfect-pedigree-dog-as-a-pet-to-fit-your-lifestyle-family-and-home-212571 |title=How to choose the perfect dog to fit your lifestyle, family and home |website=Country Life |date=8 March 2020}}</ref> They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These [[military working dogs]] (MWD) are usually trained for [[Reconnaissance|scout]] duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.{{sfnp|Strickland|Moses|1998|p=17–28}} German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10522802|title=It's a dog's life in the Army|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=22 July 2008|access-date=11 August 2008}}</ref> or as [[Anti-tank dog|anti-tank weapons]]. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.{{sfnp|Kern|1990|pp=11–21}}

The German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, [[Police dog#Cadaver dogs|cadaver searching]], [[narcotics]] detection, [[explosive detection|explosives detection]], [[fire accelerant|accelerant]] detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.{{sfnp|Strickland|Moses|1998|p=17–28}}
At one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a [[guide dog]] for the [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]]. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of [[Dorothy Eustis]], all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.<ref>{{cite book

German Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.<ref name="Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor">{{cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-1-57779-106-5}}</ref>

Canine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopaedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, [[inflammation]], lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hand | first1 = M. | last2 = Thatcher | first2 = C. | last3 = Remillard | first3 = R. | last4 = Roudebush | first4 = P. | year = 2000 | title = Small animal clinical nutrition | journal = Mark Morris Institute | volume = 4 | pages = 542–543 }}</ref> German Shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.<ref name=":2" />

Feeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German Shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German Shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:

Appropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to [[hypocalcaemia]] and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}}

Omega-3 fatty acids such as [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in ''[[in vitro]]'' models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German Shepherds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mehler | first1 = S. | last2 = May | first2 = L. | last3 = King | first3 = C. | last4 = Harris | first4 = W. | last5 = Shah | first5 = Z. | year = 2016 | title = A prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the clinical signs and erythrocyte membrane polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations in dogs with osteoarthritis | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids (PLEFA) | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 1–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.plefa.2016.03.015 | pmid = 27269707 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders.<ref name=":52"/> Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.<ref name=":52"/>

Glucosamine is an [[Monosaccharide|amino-monosaccharide]] that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of [[glucose]].<ref name=":42"/> Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | last1 = Minami | first1 = S. | last2 = Hata | first2 = M. | last3 = Tamai | first3 = Y. | last4 = Hashida | first4 = M. | last5 = Takayama | first5 = T. | last6 = Yamamoto | first6 = S. | last7 = Okada | first7 = M. | last8 = Funatsu | first8 = T. | last9 = Tsuka | first9 = T. | last10 = Imagawa | first10 = T. | last11 = Okamoto | first11 = Y. | year = 2011 | title = Clinical application of D-glucosamine and scale collagen peptide on canine and feline orthopedic diseases and spondylitis deformans | journal = Carbohydrate Polymers | volume = 84 | issue = 2| pages = 831–834 | doi = 10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.06.021 }}</ref> Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation.<ref name=":6" /> Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}}

Vitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}} Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German Shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.{{sfn|Ackerman|2008|pp=135-139}}

===Pituitary dwarfism===
[[Congenital hyposomatotropism]], also known as pituitary dwarfism has been known to be an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder in the German Shepherd dog for a long time. The condition causes growth retardation. The puppy coat is retained into adulthood and guard hairs fail to fully develop outside of the distal extremities. Eventually full [[alopecia]] occurs. The degree of growth retardation and other clinical symptoms varies between affected dogs.<ref name="hyposomatotropism"/>

Investigations into the genealogy in 1978 found the mutation evolved in 1940 or earlier. Multiple [[Championship (dog)|champions]] have been shown to be carriers of the mutation, explaining the spread and prevalence of the disorder. This condition has been observed in breeds that were crossed with German Shepherd dogs such as the [[Karelian Bear dog]], [[Saarloos Wolfhound]], and the [[Czechoslovakian Wolfdog]]. Pituitary dwarfism in other dog breeds (excluding those with German Shepherd ancestry) is extremely rare.<ref name="hyposomatotropism">{{cite book | last=Feldman | first=Edward C. | last2=Nelson | first2=Richard W. | last3=Reusch | first3=Claudia | last4=Scott-Moncrieff | first4=J.

{{ill|Kántor|hu|Kántor (kutya)}} was a famous and very successful police dog in [[Hungary]] in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalised by two crime novels by {{ill|Rudolf Szamos|hu|Szamos Rudolf}}, titled {{ill|Kántor Investigates|hu|Kántor nyomoz (regény)}} and ''Kántor in the Big City''<!-- Kántor a nagyvárosban -->. A five-part thriller series for television titled ''Kántor'' was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real Kántor died. It became one of the staple productions of Hungarian television history, making German Shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since. The [[taxidermy]] mount of Kántor's body is on display at the Police Museum in [[Budapest]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rendormuzeum.com/valogatas-mutargyainkbol|title=Kántor|website=Police Museum of Budapest|access-date=19 August 2021|language=hu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azenkutyam.hu/elet/kantor-a-rendorkutya/|title=Kántor: a leghíresebb magyar rendőrkutya története (Kántor: the history of the most famous Hungarian police dog)|date=8 August 2020|website=Az Én Kutyám|language=hu|first=Enikő|last=László}}</ref>
