<!-- Physical and chemical properties, natural occurrence -->
Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline [[purine]], a methylxanthine [[alkaloid]], and is chemically related to the [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] [[nucleobase|bases]] of [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA).

People may drink [[beverages]] containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by [[steeping]] the plant product in water, a process called [[infusion]]. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[cola]], are consumed globally in high volumes. In 2020, almost 10 million tonnes of coffee beans were consumed globally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/292595/global-coffee-consumption/|title=Global coffee consumption, 2020/21|website=Statista|access-date=10 March 2021|archive-date=3 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303145630/https://www.statista.com/statistics/292595/global-coffee-consumption/|url-status=live}}</ref> Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed [[psychoactive drug]].<ref name="abc.net" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré S | title = Caffeine and Substance Use Disorders | journal = Journal of Caffeine Research | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 57–58 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24761274 | pmc = 3680974 | doi = 10.1089/jcr.2013.0015 }}</ref> Unlike most other psychoactive substances, caffeine remains largely unregulated and legal in nearly all parts of the world.

For the general population of healthy adults, [[Health Canada]] advises a daily intake of no more than 400&nbsp;mg.<ref name="healthcanada"/> This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology.<ref name="Wikoff2017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wikoff D, Welsh BT, Henderson R, Brorby GP, Britt J, Myers E, Goldberger J, Lieberman HR, O'Brien C, Peck J, Tenenbein M, Weaver C, Harvey S, Urban J, Doepker C | title = Systematic review of the potential adverse effects of caffeine consumption in healthy adults, pregnant women, adolescents, and children | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 109 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 585–648 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28438661 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2017.04.002 | type = Systematic review | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref>

====Adolescents====
Health Canada has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier-weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without experiencing adverse effects.<ref name="healthcanada"/>

==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ====
The metabolism of caffeine is reduced in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and the half-life of caffeine during pregnancy can be increased up to 15 hours (as compared to 2.5 to 4.5 hours in non-pregnant adults).<ref name="Van Dam" /> Evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on pregnancy and for breastfeeding are inconclusive.<ref name=Jah2015 /> There is limited primary and secondary advice for, or against, [[Nutrition and pregnancy#Caffeine|caffeine use during pregnancy]] and its effects on the fetus or newborn.<ref name=Jah2015 />

The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200&nbsp;mg of caffeine a day&nbsp;– the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/nov/caffeineadvice|title=Food Standards Agency publishes new caffeine advice for pregnant women|access-date=3 August 2009|archive-date=17 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017165633/http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/nov/caffeineadvice|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200&nbsp;mg per day in pregnant women.<ref name="ACOG policy 462 caffeine" /> For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300&nbsp;mg, or a little over two 8&nbsp;oz (237&nbsp;mL) cups of coffee.<ref name="healthcanada" /> A 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology found evidence supporting that caffeine consumption up to 300&nbsp;mg/day for pregnant women is generally not associated with adverse reproductive or developmental effect.<ref name="Wikoff2017" />

[[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning.

[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine-induced elevations in [[blood pressure]] and the subjective feelings of nervousness.  [[Sensitization]], the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, occurs for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and wellbeing.<ref name="pmid19428492"/> Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200&nbsp;mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100&nbsp;mg/day, such as a {{cvt|6|oz|g}} cup of coffee or two to three {{cvt|12|oz|g}} servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
{{Synapse map}}
[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[adenosine receptor antagonist]] in the brain.|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left&nbsp;– caffeine, right&nbsp;– adenosine.]]

In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little [[adenosine]] is present in CNS neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal [[synapse]], in turn binding to and activating [[adenosine receptor]]s found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases [[drowsiness]]. When caffeine is consumed, it [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />

====Receptor and ion channel targets====
Caffeine is an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine A2A receptor|adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor]]s, and [[knockout mouse]] studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine.<ref name="pmid22886028" /> Antagonism of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the [[ventrolateral preoptic area]] (VLPO) reduces inhibitory [[GABA]] [[neurotransmission]] to the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]], a [[histamine]]rgic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal.<ref name="Ferre_2008" /> This disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the downstream mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects.<ref name="Ferre_2008" /> Caffeine is an antagonist of all four [[adenosine receptor]] subtypes ([[adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]], [[adenosine receptor A2a|A<sub>2A</sub>]], [[adenosine receptor A2b|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[adenosine receptor A3|A<sub>3</sub>]]), although with varying [[potency (pharmacology)|potencies]].<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /><ref name="pmid22886028" /> The [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] ([[dissociation constant|K<sub>D</sub>]]) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A1 receptor|A<sub>1</sub>]], 2.4&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2A receptor|A<sub>2A</sub>]], 13&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A2B receptor|A<sub>2B</sub>]], and 80&nbsp;μM at [[adenosine A3 receptor|A<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name="pmid22886028">{{cite journal | vauthors = Froestl W, Muhs A, Pfeifer A | s2cid = 10511507 | title = Cognitive enhancers (nootropics).

Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine also stimulates the [[medulla oblongata|medullary]] vagal, vasomotor, and [[respiratory center]]s, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /> Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes [[neurotransmitter]] release (e.g., [[monoamines]] and [[acetylcholine]]), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects;<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldofcaffeine.com/caffeine-and-neurotransmitters/ |title=World of Caffeine |publisher=World of Caffeine |date=15 June 2013 |access-date=19 December 2013 |archive-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210195155/http://worldofcaffeine.com/caffeine-and-neurotransmitters/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[adenosine]] acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. [[Heart palpitation]]s are caused by blockade of the A<sub>1</sub> receptor.<ref name="Drugbank-Caffeine" />

Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a [[competitive antagonist]].<ref name="pmid15095008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisone G, Borgkvist A, Usiello A | s2cid = 7578473 | title = Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 61 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 857–72 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15095008 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-003-3269-3 }}</ref>

In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an [[Inositol trisphosphate receptor|inositol trisphosphate receptor 1]] antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the [[ryanodine receptor]]s ([[RYR1]], [[RYR2]], and [[RYR3]]).<ref name="IUPHAR caffeine">{{cite web|title=Caffeine|url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&ligandId=407|website=IUPHAR|publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|access-date=2 November 2014|archive-date=2 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102064047/http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&ligandId=407|url-status=live}}</ref> It is also a competitive antagonist of the [[glycine receptor|ionotropic glycine receptor]].<ref name="pmid19564396">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duan L, Yang J, Slaughter MM | title = Caffeine inhibition of ionotropic glycine receptors | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 587 | issue = Pt 16 | pages = 4063–75 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19564396 | pmc = 2756438 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.174797 }}</ref>

====Effects on striatal dopamine====
While caffeine does not directly bind to any [[dopamine receptor]]s, it influences the binding activity of [[dopamine]] at its receptors in the [[striatum]] by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed [[GPCR oligomer|GPCR heteromers]] with dopamine receptors, specifically the [[adenosine receptor A1|A<sub>1</sub>]]–[[DRD1|D<sub>1</sub>]] receptor [[heterodimer]] (this is a receptor complex with one adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor and one dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor) and the [[adenosine receptor A2a|A<sub>2A</sub>]]–[[DRD2|D<sub>2</sub>]] receptor [[heterotetramer]] (this is a receptor complex with two adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors and two dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors).<ref name="A1-DRD1 and A2a-DRD2 review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré S | title = Role of the central ascending neurotransmitter systems in the psychostimulant effects of caffeine | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 20| issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S35–49 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20182056 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-2010-1400 | pmc = 9361505 | quote = By targeting A1-A2A receptor heteromers in striatal glutamatergic terminals and A1 receptors in striatal dopaminergic terminals (presynaptic brake), caffeine induces glutamate-dependent and glutamate-independent release of dopamine.

The [[xanthine]] core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a [[pyrimidinedione]] and [[imidazole]].  The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two [[amide]] functional groups that exist predominantly in a [[zwitterion]]ic [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] the location from which the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp<sup>2</sup> [[orbital hybridization|hybridized]] and planar.

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. Following are main methods:
* '''Water extraction:''' Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.<ref name="Decaffeination">{{cite web |vauthors=Senese F |title=How is coffee decaffeinated? |publisher=General Chemistry Online |date=20 September 2005 |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |access-date=3 August 2009 |archive-date=18 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118123537/http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>
* '''Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction:''' [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar [[solvent]] for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: {{CO2}} is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1&nbsp;°C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, {{CO2}} is in a "[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]" [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden {{CO2}} is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name="Decaffeination" />
* '''Extraction by organic solvents:''' Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.<ref name=Decaffeination/>

"Decaffeinated" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases&nbsp;– some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.<ref name="pmid17132260">{{cite journal | vauthors = McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ | title = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–3 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17132260 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.611 | publisher = University of Florida News | doi-access = free | title-link = doi | access-date = 30 August 2013 | archive-date = 18 July 2008 | url = http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080718213236/http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in [[neonates]], confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10&nbsp;mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36&nbsp;mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400&nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15&nbsp;mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors= Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=11th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2017 |pages=335–8 |isbn=978-0-692-77499-1}}</ref>

===Analogs===
Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both.

=== Precipitation of tannins ===
Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as [[cinchonine]], [[quinine]] or [[strychnine]], precipitates polyphenols and [[tannin]]s. This property can be used in a quantitation method.{{clarify|reason=Is this an application of caffeine to determine polyphenols and tannins, or a method of determining caffeine?|date=January 2022}}<ref>Plant Polyphenols: Synthesis, Properties, Significance.

The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other [[methylxanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]], and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite book | vauthors = Balentine DA, Harbowy ME, Graham HN | chapter = Tea: the Plant and its Manufacture; Chemistry and Consumption of the Beverage | title = Caffeine Consumption |year=1998 | publisher = CRC Press | veditors = Spiller GA | isbn = 978-0-429-12678-9 }}</ref>

===Beverages===
{{main|Caffeinated drink}}

====Coffee====
The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee "bean" (the seed of the [[coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;<ref name="ICO">{{cite web|title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |access-date=1 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327113321/http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |archive-date=27 March 2009 }}</ref> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]].<ref name="caffaq_roast">{{cite web |title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |access-date=2 August 2009 |archive-date=14 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214060638/http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="jeremiahspick">{{cite web|title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html |archive-date=18 March 2008 |access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref> ''[[coffea arabica|Arabica]]'' coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the ''[[coffea canephora|robusta]]'' variety.<ref name="ICO" />
In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.<ref name="caffaq_roast" /><ref name="jeremiahspick" />

====Tea====
Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.<ref name="FRI">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hicks MB, Hsieh YH, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4}}</ref>

Tea contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and slightly higher levels of [[theophylline]] than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.<ref name="FRI" />

====Soft drinks and energy drinks====
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce ({{convert|12|USfloz|mL|disp=out}}) serving.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nutrition and healthy eating|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372?pg=2|website=Mayo Clinic|access-date=18 November 2015|archive-date=22 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122063906/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372?pg=2|url-status=live}}</ref> By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:7058c79/Steadman1993xanthine.pdf }}</ref>

====Other beverages====
* [[Mate (beverage)|Mate]] is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly [[yerba mate]], pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120405-drinking-mate-in-buenos-aires|title=Drinking mate in Buenos Aires|vauthors=Martinez-Carter K|date=9 April 2012|website=BBC|access-date=23 February 2019|archive-date=24 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224005245/http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120405-drinking-mate-in-buenos-aires|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Combinations with other drugs===
* Some beverages combine [[ethanol|alcohol]] with caffeine to create a [[caffeinated alcoholic drink]].  The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the [[depressant]] effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].  Such beverages have been the subject of [[Ban on caffeinated alcoholic beverages|bans]] due to safety concerns.  In particular, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an "unsafe food additive".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm190366.htm|title=Food Additives & Ingredients > Caffeinated Alcoholic Beverages|date=17 November 2010|website=fda.gov|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-date=27 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227205153/http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm190366.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis===
[[File:Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge.jpeg|thumb|upright|Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, discoverer of caffeine]]
In 1819, the German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] isolated {{Vague|text=relatively pure|date=April 2024}} caffeine for the first time; he called it ''"Kaffebase"'' (i.e., a [[base (chemistry)|base]] that exists in coffee).<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Runge FF |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&pg=P146}} |year=1820 |publisher=G.

Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that: {{blockquote|Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. "Auch diese können Sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen," sagte Goethe.  Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein.}} ("After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man [whom I'd] rescued [from serving in Napoleon's army] by apparent "black star" [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  'You can also use these in your investigations,' said Goethe. He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.").<ref>This account appeared in Runge's book ''Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen'' (Domestic Letters [i.e., personal correspondence]) of 1866.

For example, in the 16th century [[Islamist]]s in [[Mecca]] and in the [[Ottoman Empire]] made coffee illegal for some classes.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brown DW |title=A new introduction to Islam |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newintroductiont0000brow/page/149 149–51] |isbn=978-1-4051-5807-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/newintroductiont0000brow/page/149 }}</ref><ref name="agostonmasters2009">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire | vauthors = Ágoston G, Masters B |year=2009 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QjzYdCxumFcC|page=138 |isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7}} |page=138}}</ref><ref name="hopkins2006">{{cite web|url=http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ |title=Food Stories: The Sultan's Coffee Prohibition | vauthors = Hopkins K |date=24 March 2006 |website=Accidental Hedonist |access-date=3 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120105621/http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ |archive-date=20 November 2012 }}<!-- doubtful WP:RS, but comments suggest it can be sourced to both "Devil's Cup" and "Devil's Picnic" --></ref> [[Charles II of England]] tried to ban it in 1676,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/gloning/tx/suppress.htm |title=By the King.

In 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of [[Coca-Cola]] syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], alleging the caffeine in its drink was "injurious to health".<ref name="pmid2010614">{{cite journal | vauthors = Benjamin LT, Rogers AM, Rosenbaum A | title = Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911 | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–55 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 2010614 | doi = 10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:1<42::AID-JHBS2300270105>3.0.CO;2-1 }}</ref> Although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] later ruled in favor of Coca-Cola in ''[[United States v.

However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for "food additive caffeine", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., [[guarana]], [[yerba maté]]) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reissig CJ, Strain EC, Griffiths RR | title = Caffeinated energy drinks – a growing problem | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 99 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18809264 | pmc = 2735818 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.08.001 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924075307.htm | access-date = 28 February 2018 | archive-date = 12 June 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140542/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080924075307.htm | url-status = live }}</ref> The FDA guidance was updated in 2018.<ref>{{cite web | title=Guidance on Highly Concentrated Caffeine in Dietary Supplements | website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date=16 April 2018 | url=https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-highly-concentrated-caffeine-dietary-supplements | access-date=15 January 2024}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

===Consumption===
Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000&nbsp;tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance.<ref name="abc.net" /> This amounts to an average of one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.<ref name="abc.net">{{cite news |title=What's your poison: caffeine |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |access-date=15 January 2014 | vauthors = Burchfield G | veditors = Meredith H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726194701/http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |archive-date=26 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015.<ref name="Verster2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Verster JC, Koenig J | title = Caffeine intake and its sources: A review of national representative studies | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 58 | issue = 8 | pages = 1250–1259 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 28605236 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2016.1247252 | type = Review | doi-access = free | title-link = doi }}</ref> Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most important caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups.<ref name="Verster2018" />

===Religions===
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] asked for its members to "abstain from caffeinated drinks", but has removed this from [[baptismal vows]] (while still recommending abstention as policy).<ref>{{cite book|title=The War on Coffee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32JbDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22| vauthors = Robinette GW |year = 2018|volume=1|isbn=978-0-9820787-6-1|page=22| publisher=Graffiti militante |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: "... the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine.  The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' – taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee."<ref>{{cite news|title=Mormonism in the News: Getting It Right August 29|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|year=2012|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormonism-news--getting-it-right-august-29|access-date=17 April 2016|archive-date=30 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630020837/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormonism-news--getting-it-right-august-29|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and overstimulates the senses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dandavats.com/?p=2766|title=If Krishna does not accept my Chocolates, Who should I offer them to?|work=Dandavats.com|access-date=19 April 2018|language=en-US|archive-date=20 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420073754/http://www.dandavats.com/?p=2766|url-status=live}}</ref> To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Buxton J |title=The Politics of Narcotic Drugs: A Survey|date=17 December 2010|isbn=978-1857437591|pages=189|publisher=Routledge }}</ref>
