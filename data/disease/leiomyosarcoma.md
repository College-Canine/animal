A '''leiomyosarcoma''', also known as LMS, is a rare malignant (cancerous) smooth muscle tumor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Leiomyosarcoma - Overview - Mayo Clinic |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leiomyosarcoma/cdc-20387733 |access-date=2023-10-04 |website=www.mayoclinic.org}}</ref> The origin of the word is from [[wiktionary:leio-|leio-]] + [[wiktionary:myo-|myo-]] + [[wiktionary:sarcoma|sarcoma]] which means malignant smooth muscle tumor. The [[stomach]], [[bladder]], [[uterus]], [[blood vessel]]s, and [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]] are examples of hollow organs made up of smooth muscles where LMS can be located; however, the uterus or abdomen are the most common sites.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2020-06-22 |title=Leiomyosarcoma - NCI |url=https://www.cancer.gov/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/rare-tumors/rare-soft-tissue-tumors/leiomyosarcoma |access-date=2023-10-04 |website=www.cancer.gov |language=en}}</ref>

Although leiomyosarcomas are rare, they belong to of the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 10–20% of new cases.<ref name=":1" /> This type of cancer is more frequently diagnosed in adults as compared to children.<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, when considering LMS specifically in the context of the uterus, it affects approximately 6 individuals per 1 million people in the United States each year.<ref name=":1" /> LMSs are resistant cancers, meaning they are generally not very responsive to [[chemotherapy]] or radiation. The best outcomes occur when the tumor tissue can be removed surgically at an early stage, while it is small and has not yet spread from the original site (it remains ''[[in situ]]'')''.''<ref name=LMS_info>{{cite web|title=Basic info|website=Leiomyosarcoma.info|url=http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/basic.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430111311/http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/basic.htm|archive-date=2009-04-30}}</ref> LMSs are seen in adults more often than they are seen in children.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Vinay |title=Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |last2=Abbas |first2=Abul K. |last3=Aster |first3=Jon C. |publisher=Jeremy Bowes |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-323-53113-9 |edition=10th |pages=1208 |language=English |chapter=Chapter 26: Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue Tumors}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Smooth muscle cells make up the [[Smooth muscle tissue|involuntary muscles]], which are found in most parts of the body, including the uterus, stomach and intestines, the walls of all blood vessels, and the skin. These are the areas where LMSs originate from.<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Aster, Jon C. (2021). "Chapter 26: Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue Tumors". ''Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' (10th&nbsp;ed.). Jeremy Bowes. p.1213. {{ISBN|978-0-323-53113-9}}.</ref> LMSs also often develop in the [[Retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneal region]]<ref name=":2" /> which consists of the suprarenal glands, the kidney, and ureter. Just as it is not known what truly causes most sarcomas, LMSs have similarly complex karyotypes and it is suggested that because of the complexity, genomic instability might be the cause.<ref name=":2" />

Uterine leiomyosarcomas come from the smooth muscle in the muscle layer of the uterus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/learning_center/leiomyosarcoma_uterus.html|title=Leiomyosarcoma of the Uterus (ULMS): A Review|publisher=The Liddy Shriver Sarcoma Initiative|author1=Sue Ghosh |author2=Jonathan Hecht |author3=Tanaz Ferzandi |author4=Christopher Awtrey |year=2007|access-date=1 February 2016}}</ref> Cutaneous leiomyosarcomas derive from the [[Erectores pilorum|pilo-erector]] muscles in the skin. Gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas might come from smooth muscle in the GI tract, or alternatively, from a blood vessel. At most other primary sites—retroperitoneal extremity (in the abdomen, behind the intestines), truncal, abdominal organs, etc.—leiomyosarcomas appear to grow from the muscle layer of a blood vessel (the [[tunica media]]). Thus, a leiomyosarcoma can have a primary site of origin anywhere in the body from a blood vessel.<ref name=LMS_info/>

The tumors are usually hemorrhagic and soft and microscopically marked by pleomorphism, abundant (15–30 per 10 high-power fields) abnormal mitotic figures, and coagulative tumor cell necrosis. The differential diagnosis, which includes spindle cell carcinoma, spindle cell [[melanoma]], [[fibrosarcoma]], malignant [[peripheral nerve sheath tumor]] and even [[Biphenotypic Sinonasal Sarcoma|biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma]], is wide.

==Diagnosis==

[[File:Histopathology of leiomyosarcoma.jpg|thumb|[[Histopathology]] of leiomyosarcoma shows variable atypia, often with cytoplasmic vacuoles at both ends of nuclei, and frequent mitoses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/softtissueleiomyosarcoma.html|title=Soft tissue - Smooth muscle - Leiomyosarcoma - general|author=Vijay Shankar, M.D.|website=Pathology Outlines}} Topic Completed: 1 November 2012. Revised: 11 September 2019</ref>]]
To diagnose LMS, a physical exam may be performed by one’s physician, imaging tests such as MIT, CT and PET scans can be performed, or tissue biopsies can also be completed where the histopathology of the removed tissue sample is examined.<ref name=":0" /> Because LMS is a widespread disease, the symptoms vary based on the location of the tumor and also, the size.<ref name=":1" /> Some of the symptoms include nausea and vomiting, palpable lumps, pain, bleeding and unintentional weight loss.<ref name=":1" />

== Treatment ==
Surgery, with as wide a margin of removal as possible, has generally been the most effective and preferred way to attack LMS.  If surgical margins are narrow or not clear of tumor, however, or in some situations where tumor cells were left behind, chemotherapy or radiation has been shown to give a clear survival benefit.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Chemotherapy |date=August 2002 |website=Leiomyosarcoma.info |url=http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/chemo10therapy.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625203601/http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/chemo10therapy.htm |archive-date=2009-06-25 }}</ref>  While LMS tends to be resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, each case is different and results can vary widely.

For metastatic (widespread) disease, chemotherapy and targeted therapies are the first choices. 
Chemotherapy regimens include: [[doxorubicin]]/[[ifosfamide]] and doxorubicin combination/[[gemcitabine]] and [[docetaxel]]/[[trabectedin]];<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1200/jco.2015.65.7130| pmid=27458287| title=Trabectedin in Soft Tissue Sarcoma: Have We Hit the Bull's-eye?| journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology| volume=34| issue=29| pages=3582–3583| year=2016| last1=Rastogi| first1=Sameer| last2=Bakhshi| first2=Sameer}}</ref> [[pazopanib]] is the targeted therapy used in metastatic leiomyosarcoma as second line and is well tolerated.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.4103/ijc.IJC_105_18|title = Pazopanib efficacy and toxicity in a metastatic sarcoma cohort: Are Indian patients different?|journal = Indian Journal of Cancer|volume = 56|issue = 3|pages = 207–210|year = 2019|last1 = Rastogi|first1 = Sameer|last2 = Sharma|first2 = Aparna|last3 = Vanidassane|first3 = Ilavarasi|last4 = Aggarwal|first4 = Aditi|last5 = Mridha|first5 = Asitranjan|last6 = Pandey|first6 = Rambha|last7 = Dhamija|first7 = Ekta|last8 = Barwad|first8 = Adarsh|pmid = 31389382|s2cid = 198168573 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Uterine leiomyomas vs uterine leiomyosarcomas ==
[[Leiomyoma]]s are benign smooth muscle tumors that have overlapping features with leiomyosarcomas. Although both originate from smooth muscle, it is important to note that leiomyomas do not mature to become leiomyosarcomas.<ref>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Aster, Jon C. (2021). "Chapter 26: Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue Tumors". ''Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' (10th&nbsp;ed.). Jeremy Bowes. p.1014. {{ISBN|978-0-323-53113-9}}</ref> Leiomyomas are seen in pre-menopausal women and are symptomatic 20–50% of the time, while leiomyosarcomas, the most common uterine sarcomas, are seen in older post-menopausal women<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=S. |last2=Bonaffini |first2=P.

(2021). "Chapter 26: Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue Tumors". ''Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' (10th&nbsp;ed.). Jeremy Bowes. p.1015.{{ISBN|978-0-323-53113-9}}</ref> Since leiomyomas are benign and mostly asymptomatic, minimally invasive treatment modalities are used to treat them.<ref name=":3" /> For this same reason, it is crucial to distinguish them from LMSs before surgical procedures to ensure that laparoscopic procedures or diagnosis delay will not lead to heightened morbidity given the poor prognosis of LMS.<ref name=":3" /> For example, the FDA has warned against using morcellation for benign leiomyomas as those with unsuspected sarcomas are at risk of cancer spread.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Health |first=Center for Devices and Radiological |date=2020-12-30 |title=UPDATE: Perform Only Contained Morcellation When Laparoscopic Power Morcellation Is Appropriate: FDA Safety Communication |url=https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/update-perform-only-contained-morcellation-when-laparoscopic-power-morcellation-appropriate-fda |journal=FDA |language=en}}</ref>
