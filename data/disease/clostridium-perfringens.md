Infections due to ''C. perfringens'' show evidence of tissue [[necrosis]], [[bacteremia]], emphysematous [[cholecystitis]], and [[gas gangrene]], also known as clostridial [[myonecrosis]]. The specific name, ''perfringens,'' is derived from the [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|per}} (meaning "through") and {{Lang|la|frango}} ("burst"), referring to the disruption of tissue that occurs during gas gangrene.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lexicon Orthopaedic Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9789057025976 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fstFQVnw8-wC |language=en}}</ref> The toxin involved in gas gangrene is [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin|α-toxin]], which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells, producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function. ''C. perfringens'' can participate in polymicrobial [[anaerobic infection]]s.  It is commonly encountered in [[infection]]s as a component of the normal [[flora (microbiology)|flora]].

== Motility ==
''Clostridium perfringens'' is provisionally identified as non-motile. They lack flagella; however, recent research suggests gliding as a form of motility. <ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Valeriani |first1=Renzo G. |last2=Beard |first2=LaMonta L. |last3=Moller |first3=Abraham |last4=Ohtani |first4=Kaori |last5=Vidal |first5=Jorge E. |date=2020-12-01 |title=Gas gangrene-associated gliding motility is regulated by the Clostridium perfringens CpAL/VirSR system |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996420301438 |journal=Anaerobe |volume=66 |pages=102287 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.102287 |issn=1075-9964}}</ref>

=== Hyper-motile variations ===

In agar plate cultures bacteria with hypermotile variations like SM101 frequently appear around the borders of the colonies. They create long thin filaments that enable them to move quickly, much like bacteria with flagella, according to video imaging of their gliding motion. The causes of the hypermotile phenotype and its immediate descendants were found using genome sequencing. The hypermotile offspring of strains SM101 and SM102, SM124 and SM127, respectively, had 10 and 6 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in comparison to their parent strains. The hypermotile strains have the common trait of gene mutations related to cell division.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Hualan |last2=McCord |first2=Kristin D. |last3=Howarth |first3=Jonathon |last4=Popham |first4=David L. |last5=Jensen |first5=Roderick V. |last6=Melville |first6=Stephen B. |date=July 2014 |title=Hypermotility in Clostridium perfringens Strain SM101 Is Due to Spontaneous Mutations in Genes Linked to Cell Division |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=196 |issue=13 |pages=2405–2412 |doi=10.1128/JB.01614-14 |issn=0021-9193 |pmc=4054169 |pmid=24748614}}</ref>

=== Regulation of gliding motility: The CpAL/VirSR system ===
Some strains of ''C. perfringens'' cause various diseases like gas gangrene and myonecrosis. Toxins produced that are required for myonecrosis is regulated by the ''C. perfringens'' Agr-like (CpAl) system through the VirSR two-component system. The CpAL/VirSR system is a quorum sensing system encoded by other pathogenic clostridia. Myonecrosis starts at the infection site and involves bacteria migrating deeper via gliding motility. Researchers investigated if the CpAL/VirSR system regulates gliding motility. The study demonstrated that   the CpAL/VirSR regulates ''C. perfringens''gliding motility. Additionally, that gliding bacteria in myonecrosis have  increased transcription of toxin genes.<ref name=":1" />

== Transformation ==
{{main article|Transformation (genetics)}}
There are two methods of [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] via experimentation that have been shown to cause genetic transformation in ''C. perfringens''. 

=== Protoplast transformation ===
The first report of transformation in ''C. perfringens'' involved [[polyethylene]] [[Glycol|glycol-mediated transformation]] of [[Protoplast|protoplasts]]. The transformation procedure involved the addition of the plasmid DNA to the protoplasts in the presence of high concentrations of [[polyethylene glycol]]. During the first protoplast transformation experiment, L-phase variants of ''C. perfringens'' were generated by [[penicillin]] treatment in the presence 0.4m sucrose. After the transformation procedure was completed, all of the transformed cells were still in the form of L-phase variants. Reversion to vegetative cells was not obtained, but it was observed that autoplasts (protoplasts derived from [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]]) were able to be regenerated to produce rods with cell walls and could be transformed with ''C. perfringens'' plasmid DNA.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rood |first1=J I |last2=Cole |first2=S T |date=December 1991 |title=Molecular genetics and pathogenesis of Clostridium perfringens |journal=Microbiological Reviews |language=en |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=621–648 |doi=10.1128/mr.55.4.621-648.1991 |issn=0146-0749 |pmc=372840 |pmid=1779929}}</ref>

=== Electroporation ===

''C. perfringens'' has a complete set of [[Enzyme|enzymes]] for [[glycolysis]] and [[glycogen]] metabolism. In the fermentation pathway, [[pyruvate]] is converted into [[acetyl-CoA]] by [[pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase]], producing [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] gas and reduced [[ferredoxin]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shimizu |first1=Tohru |last2=Ohtani |first2=Kaori |last3=Hirakawa |first3=Hideki |last4=Ohshima |first4=Kenshiro |last5=Yamashita |first5=Atsushi |last6=Shiba |first6=Tadayoshi |last7=Ogasawara |first7=Naotake |last8=Hattori |first8=Masahira |last9=Kuhara |first9=Satoru |last10=Hayashi |first10=Hideo |date=2002-01-22 |title=Complete genome sequence of Clostridium perfringens , an anaerobic flesh-eater |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=996–1001 |doi=10.1073/pnas.022493799 |doi-access=free |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=117419 |pmid=11792842|bibcode=2002PNAS...99..996S }}</ref> Electrons from the reduced ferredoxin are transferred to protons by hydrogenase, resulting in the formation of hydrogen molecules (H2) that are released from the cell along with [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]].

==Infection==
Infections due to ''C. perfringens'' show evidence of tissue [[necrosis]], [[bacteremia]], emphysematous [[cholecystitis]], and [[gas gangrene]], also known as clostridial [[myonecrosis]]. The toxin involved in gas gangrene is [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin|α-toxin]], which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells, producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function. ''C. perfringens'' can participate in polymicrobial [[anaerobic infection]]s.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

''Clostridium perfringens'' food poisoning can also lead to another disease known as enteritis necroticans or [[clostridial necrotizing enteritis]], (also known as pigbel); this is caused by ''C. perfringens'' type C. This infection is often fatal. Large numbers of ''C. perfringens'' grow in the intestines, and secrete exotoxin. This exotoxin causes necrosis of the intestines, varying levels of hemorrhaging, and perforation of the intestine. Inflammation usually occurs in sections of the jejunum, midsection of the small intestine. This disease eventually leads to septic shock and death. This particular disease is rare in the United States; typically, it occurs in populations with a higher risk. Risk factors for enteritis necroticans include protein-deficient diet, unhygienic food preparation, sporadic feasts of meat (after long periods of a protein-deficient diet), diets containing large amounts of [[trypsin]] inhibitors ([[sweet potatoes]]), and areas prone to infection of the parasite ''[[Ascaris]]'' (produces a trypsin inhibitor).

== Non-pathogenic properties: Salt-rising bread ==
Salt-rising bread is an Appalachian traditional bread that is made without yeast. Its origins are tied closely to the 19<sup>th</sup>century where it was likely difficult to obtain fresh yeast and keep a bread starter fresh and cool. However, the name is misleading because salt does not play a major role. <ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=McGee |first=Harold |date=2014-05-20 |title=The Disquieting Delights Of Salt-Rising Bread |url=https://www.popsci.com/article/science/clostridium-it-can-kill-you-or-it-can-make-you-bread/ |access-date=2024-04-17 |website=Popular Science |language=en-US}}</ref> The starter is composed of flour, milk, potatoes, and ''Clostridium perfringens'', the rising agent. <ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Juckett |first1=Gregory |last2=Bardwell |first2=Genevieve |last3=McClane |first3=Bruce |last4=Brown |first4=Susan |date=2008 |title=Microbiology of salt rising bread |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18646681 |journal=The West Virginia Medical Journal |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=26–27 |issn=0043-3284 |pmid=18646681}}</ref> In 1923, the realization that the salt-rising bacterium was a form of pathogen came from a USDA microbiologist named Staurt Koser. He found that that bread was filled with ''Clostridium perfringens'' that was commonly found in gangrenous flesh wounds. He tested strains of the bacteria from salt-rising loaves at the bakery and found that it did not cause gangrene on guinea pigs. He then obtained a bacillus culture that had originally been taken from a soldier’s infected wound and he made bread with the wound bacteria. He found that size and texture were favorable with the bakery loaves. <ref name=":2" /> His findings suggest that there were different strains of ''Clostridium perfringens'' with different toxicities. 

==Food poisoning==
''C. perfringens'' forms [[bacterial spores|spores]] that are distributed through air, soil, and water. The most common cause of illness comes from the ingestion of poorly cooked meats that are contaminated by these spores.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/clostridium-perfringens.html "Prevent Illness From C. perfringens"], [[CDC]]</ref>  After this meat is left out at 20&nbsp;°C to 60&nbsp;°C, the spores  germinate and ''C. perfringens'' then grows rapidly. The bacteria produce a toxin that causes diarrhea.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Clostridium perfringens Food Poisoning - Infectious Diseases |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/anaerobic-bacteria/clostridium-perfringens-food-poisoning |access-date=2023-10-17 |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |language=en-US}}</ref>

Since ''C. perfringens'' forms spores that can withstand cooking temperatures, if cooked food is left standing for long enough, germination can ensue and infective bacterial colonies develop. Symptoms typically include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever.<ref name="Lentino-2016" /> The whole course usually resolves within 24 hours, but can last up to 2 weeks in older or infirm hosts.<ref name="CDC">{{Cite web |date=2015-10-08 |title=Clostridium perfringens |url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/clostridium-perfringens.html |access-date=2016-09-27 |website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> Despite its potential dangers, ''C. perfringens'' is used as the [[leavening agent]] in [[salt-rising bread]]. The baking process is thought to reduce the bacterial contamination, precluding negative effects.<ref name="Jucket2008" />

Many cases of ''C. perfringens'' food poisoning likely remain [[subclinical]], as [[antibody|antibodies]] to the toxin are common among the population. This has led to the conclusion that most of the population has experienced food poisoning due to ''C. perfringens''.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

== Virulence ==

==== Alpha toxin ====
Alpha toxin (CPA) is a zinc-containing phospholipase C, composed of two structural domains, which destroy a cell's membrane. Alpha toxins are produced by all five types of ''C. perfringens.'' This toxin is linked to [[gas gangrene]] of humans and animals. Most cases of gas gangrene has been related to a deep wound being contaminated by soil that harbors ''C. perfringens''.<ref name="Stiles-2013" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Ming |last2=Li |first2=Ning |date=2021-06-16 |title=Clostridium perfringens bloodstream infection secondary to acute pancreatitis: A case report |journal=World Journal of Clinical Cases |volume=9 |issue=17 |pages=4357–4364 |doi=10.12998/wjcc.v9.i17.4357 |pmid=34141801 |pmc=8173429 |issn=2307-8960 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==== Beta toxin ====
Beta toxins (CPB) are a protein that causes hemorrhagic [[Clostridial necrotizing enteritis|necrotizing enteritis]] and [[Enterotoxemia|enterotoxaemia]] in both animals (type B) and humans (type C) which leads to the infected individual's feces becoming bloody and their intestines necrotizing.<ref name="Stiles-2013" />

==== Epsilon toxin ====
Epsilon toxin (ETX) is a protein produced by type B and type D strains of ''C. perfringens.'' This toxin is currently ranked the third most potent bacterial toxin known.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Alves |first1=Guilherme Guerra |last2=Machado de Ávila |first2=Ricardo Andrez |last3=Chávez-Olórtegui |first3=Carlos Delfin |last4=Lobato |first4=Francisco Carlos Faria |date=2014-12-01 |title=Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin: The third most potent bacterial toxin known |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996414001309 |journal=Anaerobe |volume=30 |pages=102–107 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2014.08.016 |pmid=25234332 |issn=1075-9964}}</ref> ETX causes [[Enterotoxemia|enterotoxaemia]] in mainly goats and sheep, but cattle are sometime susceptible to it as well.

The very low LD50 of ETX has led to concern that it may be used as a bioweapon. It appeared on the [[select agent]] lists of the US CDC and USDA, until it was removed in 2012. There are no human vaccines for this toxin, but effective vaccines for animals exist.<ref name=MEDCOE>{{cite book |last1=Stiles |first1=Bradley G. |last2=Barth |first2=Gillian |last3=Popoff |first3=Michel R.

==== Iota toxin ====
Iota toxin (ITX) is a protein produced by type E strains of ''C. perfringens.'' Iota toxins are made up of two, unlinked proteins that form a multimeric complex on cells. Iota toxins prevent the formation of filamentous actin. This causes the destruction of the cells cytoskeleton which in turn leads to the death of the cell as it can no longer maintain homeostasis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sakurai |first1=Jun |last2=Nagahama |first2=Masahiro |last3=Oda |first3=Masataka |last4=Tsuge |first4=Hideaki |last5=Kobayashi |first5=Keiko |date=2009-12-23 |title=Clostridium perfringens Iota-Toxin: Structure and Function |journal=Toxins |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=208–228 |doi=10.3390/toxins1020208 |issn=2072-6651 |pmc=3202787 |pmid=22069542 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==== Enterotoxin ====
This toxin (CPE) causes food poisoning. It alters intracellular claudin tight junctions in gut epithelial cells. This pore-forming toxin also can bind to human ileal and colonic epithelium  in vitro and necrotize it. Through the caspase-3 pathway, this toxin can cause apoptosis of affected cells. This toxin is linked to type F strains, but has also been found to be produced by certain types of C, D, and E strains.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kiu |first1=Raymond |last2=Hall |first2=Lindsay J. |date=2018-12-01 |title=An update on the human and animal enteric pathogen Clostridium perfringens |journal=Emerging Microbes & Infections |language=en |volume=7 |issue=1 |page=141 |doi=10.1038/s41426-018-0144-8 |pmid=30082713 |pmc=6079034 |issn=2222-1751|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
''Clostridium perfringens'' can be diagnosed by Nagler's reaction, in which the suspect organism is cultured on an egg yolk media plate. One side of the plate contains anti-alpha-toxin, while the other side does not. A streak of suspect organism is placed through both sides. An area of turbidity will form around the side that does not have the anti-alpha-toxin, indicating uninhibited [[lecithinase]] activity.{{cn|date=January 2024}} ''Clostridium perfringens'' produces large colonies with irregular margins, often with a double zone of hemolysis.<ref name=LDH>{{Cite web|url=https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-CH/infectious-epi/EpiManual/ClostridiumPerfringensManual.pdf|title=Clostridium perfringens|date=2015-11-24|website=Louisiana Department of Health|access-date=2023-03-06}}</ref> In addition, laboratories can diagnose the bacteria by determining the number of bacteria in the feces. Within the 48 hours from when the disease began, if the individual has more than 10<sup>6</sup> spores of the bacteria per gram of stool, then the illness is diagnosed as ''C. perfringens'' food poisoning.<ref name="CDC" />

Typically, the symptoms of ''C. perfringens'' poisoning are used to diagnose it. However, diagnosis can be made using a stool culture test, in which the feces are tested for toxins produced by the bacteria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf|title=Bad Bug Book (Second Edition)|date=2014-10-07|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Most foods, notably beef and chicken, can be prevented from growing C. perfringens spores by cooking them to the necessary internal temperatures. The best way to check internal temperatures is by using kitchen thermometers.<ref name="CDC" /> The temperature that ''C. perfringens'' can multiply within can range anywhere from 59&nbsp;°F (15&nbsp;°C) to 122&nbsp;°F (50&nbsp;°C).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Taormina |first1=Peter J. |last2=Dorsa |first2=Warren J. |date=July 2004 |title=Growth Potential of Clostridium perfringens during Cooling of Cooked Meats |journal=Journal of Food Protection |language=en |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1537–1547 |doi=10.4315/0362-028X-67.7.1537 |pmid=15270517|doi-access=free }}</ref> After two hours of preparation, leftover food should be chilled to a temperature of less than 40&nbsp;°F (4&nbsp;°C). Large pots of soup or stew that contain meats should be split into smaller portions and refrigerated with a lid on. Before serving, leftovers must be warmed to at least 165&nbsp;°F (74&nbsp;°C). As a general rule, food should be avoided if it tastes, smells, or appears differently than it should. Food that has been out for a long period might also be unsafe to eat, even if it appears healthy.<ref name="CDC" />

== Use in Salt-Rising Bread ==
[[Salt-rising bread]] (SRB) is an Appalachian traditional bread made without yeast, using a starter derived from flour, milk and potatoes. The “[[Raising agent|rising agent]]” has been identified as ''C. perfringens'', not salt, and is presumably derived from the environment. SRB starter samples were cultured at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and abundant ''C. perfringens'' type A grew out of all samples. Despite ''C. perfringens'' being a common cause of food poisoning, none of the cultures were positive for [[enterotoxin]] and therefore would be unlikely to cause human food borne disease. Fortunately, there are no reported cases of illness or death reported from SRB consumption. However, since each starter presumably obtains its bacteria from the environment, there is always the potential for [[Enteropathogenic E. coli|enteropathogenic]] strains to appear, causing toxin-rich ''C. perfringens'' to appear in food samples in the form of vegetative spores.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Juckett |first1=Gregory |last2=Bardwell |first2=Genevieve |last3=McClane |first3=Bruce |last4=Brown |first4=Susan |date=2008 |title=Microbiology of salt rising bread |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18646681/#:~:text=Salt%20rising%20bread%20(SRB)%20is,been%20attributed%20to%20SRB%2C%20C. |journal=The West Virginia Medical Journal |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=26–27 |issn=0043-3284 |pmid=18646681}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
The most important aspect of treatment is prompt and extensive surgical debridement of the involved area and excision of all devitalized tissue, in which the organisms are prone to grow. Administration of antimicrobial drugs, particularly penicillin, is begun at the same time. ''Clostridium perfringens'' is more often susceptible to vancomycin compared to other pathogenic Clostridia and 20% of the strains are resistant to clindamycin.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Di Bella |first1=Stefano |last2=Antonello |first2=Roberta Maria |last3=Sanson |first3=Gianfranco |last4=Maraolo |first4=Alberto Enrico |last5=Giacobbe |first5=Daniele Roberto |last6=Sepulcri |first6=Chiara |last7=Ambretti |first7=Simone |last8=Aschbacher |first8=Richard |last9=Bartolini |first9=Laura |last10=Bernardo |first10=Mariano |last11=Bielli |first11=Alessandra |date=June 2022 |title=Anaerobic bloodstream infections in Italy (ITANAEROBY): A 5-year retrospective nationwide survey |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1075996422000713 |journal=Anaerobe |language=en |volume=75 |pages=102583 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.102583|pmid=35568274 |s2cid=248736289 |hdl=11368/3020691 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Hyperbaric oxygen may be of help in the medical management of clostridial tissue infections.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jawetz Melnick & Adelbergs Medical Microbiology - 27E}}</ref>
