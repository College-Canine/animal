The '''Labrador Retriever''' or simply '''Labrador''' is a British [[list of dog breeds|breed]] of [[retriever]] [[gun dog]]. It was developed in the United Kingdom from [[St. John's water dog]]s imported from the [[Newfoundland Colony|colony of Newfoundland]] (now a [[Newfoundland and Labrador|province of Canada]]), and was named after the [[Labrador]] region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.

The Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.<ref name="akc" /> It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a [[companion dog]]. It may also be trained as a [[guide dog|guide]] or [[assistance dog]], or for [[rescue dog|rescue]] or [[therapy dog|therapy]] work.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |date=4 April 2012 |access-date=9 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511200854/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archive-date=11 May 2012 }}</ref>

In the 1830s, the [[Alexander Home, 10th Earl of Home|10th Earl of Home]] and his nephews, the [[Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch|5th Duke of Buccleuch]] and [[Lord John Scott]],<ref name="Field">Article written for The Field, 30 May 1896, 'Labrador Dogs', by John S Kerss</ref> imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the [[James Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury|2nd Earl of Malmesbury]], who bred them for their expertise in [[Waterfowl hunting|waterfowling]].<ref name="Field" />

During the 1880s, the [[James Harris, 3rd Earl of Malmesbury|3rd Earl of Malmesbury]], the [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch|6th Duke of Buccleuch]], and the [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|12th Earl of Home]] collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.<ref>{{cite book |author1=The Labrador Retriever Club, Inc. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwkPAAAACAAJ |title=The Official Book of the Labrador Retriever |publisher=TFH Publications, Inc. |year=1995 |isbn=9780793801886 |editor1-last=Ziessow |editor1-first=Dr. Bernard W. |edition=1st |location=1 TFH Plaza, Third & Union Aves, Neptune, NJ 07753, USA |pages=24–25 |language=en |chapter=The Labrador Dog |ref=TOBOTL |access-date=2 September 2023}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Buccleuch Avon (1885).png|thumb|[[Buccleuch Avon]], whelped in 1885]]

The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in [[Newfoundland]] were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and [[Poole]] in [[Dorset]]. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the [[Earl of Malmesbury]], the [[Duke of Buccleuch]], the [[Earl of Home]], and [[Sir John Scott]]. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Lesser Newfoundland]], with [[Charles William George St John|Charles St. John]] even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel [[Peter Hawker]] describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]], more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.<ref name=Drury1903>{{cite book|last1=Holland-Hibert|first1=A.|title=British dogs, their points, selection, and show preparation|editor1-last=Drury|editor1-first=William D.|publisher=Upcot Gill|edition=3|year=1903|chapter=Ch.XXX - The Labrador|pages=356–358|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/britishdogstheir00drurrich/page/356}}</ref> Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the "proper Labrador" and St. John's breed of these dogs<ref name=Drury1903/><ref name=Hawker1846/> in the fifth edition of his book ''Instructions to Young Sportsmen'', published in 1846.<ref name=Hawker1846>{{cite book|last1=Hawker|first1=Peter|title=Instructions to Young Sportsmen in all that relates to Guns and Shooting|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green|edition=5|year=1846|chapter=Dogs|pages=245|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/instructionstoy02hawkgoog/page/n269}}</ref>

There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the [[conformation show]] bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.<ref name="akc">{{cite web

  | access-date = 13 September 2007}}</ref> Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.
* '''Size''': Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the [[withers]] to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for dogs of {{convert|55|-|80|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}} and for bitches as {{convert|55|-|70|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}}.<ref name="akc" /> The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives {{convert|21.5|to|24.5|in|cm|disp=flip|0}} for dogs and {{convert|21.5|to|23.5|in|cm|disp=flip|0}} for bitches,<ref name="akc" /> The Kennel Club which advises that dogs should be {{convert|56|to|57|cm|in|round=0.5}} with bitches between {{convert|55|and|56|cm|in|round=0.5}},<ref name="kc">[http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/109 Retriever (Labrador) Breed Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031032613/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/109 |date=31 October 2011 }}.

Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Accessed May 2020.</ref>
* '''Coat''': The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to the water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.<ref name="akc.org">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/labrador_retriever/index.cfm "Get to Know the Labrador Retriever"], 'The American Kennel Club', Retrieved 29 May 2014</ref>
* '''Head''': The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and be set slightly above the eyes.
* '''Jaws''': The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.
* '''Body''': The body should have a powerful and muscular build.

The tail and coat are designated "distinctive [or distinguishing] features" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC.<ref name="akc"/><ref name="kc" /> The AKC adds that the "true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail."<ref name="akc" />

Puppies of all colours can occur in the same [[Litter (animal)|litter]]. Coat colour is determined primarily by three genes, called [[Melanocortin 1 receptor|''MC1R'']], [[Agouti coloration genetics|''Agouti'']], and ''CBD103''. If a dog carries [[Wild type|wild type alleles]] at all three loci, the dog will have a yellow coat. If a dog has a loss-of-function mutation at MC1R, it will also have a yellow coat, regardless of the genotypes at the other two loci. Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for MC1R and Agouti, together with the black allele of CBD103, will have a black coat.<ref name=Candille-Kaelin-etal-2007>

According to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245&nbsp;Labradors studied were [[heterozygous]] for the M264V mutation responsible for the [[melanistic mask]], and one was [[homozygous]]. Within this breed, the trait cannot be determined simply by appearance.<ref>

As a result of specialised breeding, there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as "American" and the latter as "English", in fact, both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Kennel Club|first=The Labrador Retriever Club, Inc.|title=American vs. English|url=http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=English+vs.+American|access-date=2 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705101113/http://www.thelabradorclub.com/subpages/show_contents.php?page=English+vs.+American|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Labrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study published in 2006, tested the suitability of four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) as guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Serpell|first=James|title=The Domestic Dog: its Evolution, Behavior and Interactions With People|url=https://archive.org/details/domesticdogitsev00serp|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-41529-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jveb.2006.06.004 |title=Suitability for field service in 4 breeds of guide dogs |year=2006 |last1=Ennik |first1=Irma |last2=Liinamo |first2=Anna-Elisa |last3=Leighton |first3=Eldin |last4=Van Arendonk |first4=Johan |journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=67–74}}</ref>
