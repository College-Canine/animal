'''Selegiline''', also known as '''<small>L</small>-deprenyl''' and sold under the brand names '''Eldepryl''', '''Emsam''', '''Selgin''', among other names, is a medication which is used in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name=DrugNames>{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/international/selegiline.html|work=Drugs.com |title=Selegiline|access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref> It is provided in the form of a capsule or [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] taken [[oral administration|by mouth]] or [[orally disintegrating tablet]]s taken on the tongue for Parkinson's disease and as a [[transdermal patch|patch applied to skin]] for depression.

Selegiline acts as a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]], and increases levels of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s in the [[brain]]. At typical clinical doses used for Parkinson's disease, selegiline is a [[binding selectivity|selective]] and [[irreversible inhibitor]] of [[monoamine oxidase B]] (MAO-B), increasing levels of [[dopamine]] in the brain. In larger doses (more than 20&nbsp;mg/day), it loses its specificity for MAO-B and also inhibits [[monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], which increases [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] levels in the brain.

===Depression===
Selegiline is also delivered via a [[transdermal patch]] used as a treatment for [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name=PatchLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/021336s005s010,021708s000lbl.pdf Emsam label] Last revised Sept 2014.

Administration of transdermal selegiline bypasses [[First pass effect|hepatic first pass metabolism]]. This avoids inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A activity, which would result in an increase of food-borne [[tyramine]] in the blood and possible related adverse effects, while allowing for a sufficient amount of selegiline to reach the brain for an antidepressant effect.<ref name="pmid19300583">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KC, Chen JJ | title = Transdermal selegiline for the treatment of major depressive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 527–537 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 19300583 | pmc = 2656289 }}</ref>

A quantitative review published in 2015 found that for the pooled results of the pivotal trials, the [[number needed to treat]] (a sign of [[effect size]], so a low number is better) for the patch for symptom reduction was 11, and for remission, was 9.<ref name=QuantRev2013/> The [[number needed to harm]] (inverse of the NNT, a high number here is better) ranged from 387 for sexual side effects to 7 for application site reaction.<ref name=QuantRev2013/> With regard to the likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH), the analysis showed that the selegiline patch was 3.6 times as likely to lead to a remission vs. a discontinuation due to side effects; the LHH for remission vs. incidence of insomnia was 2.1; the LHH for remission vs. discontinuation due to insomnia was 32.7. The LHH for remission vs. insomnia and sexual dysfunction were both very low.<ref name=QuantRev2013/>

===Special populations===
For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is [[pregnancy category]] C: studies in pregnant lab animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus but there are no adequate studies in humans.<ref name="PillLabel" /><ref name="PatchLabel" />

==Side effects==
[[Side effect]]s of the tablet form in conjunction with [[levodopa]] include, in decreasing order of frequency, [[nausea]], [[hallucination]]s, [[confusion]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[loss of balance]], [[insomnia]], increased involuntary movements, [[agitation (dementia)|agitation]], [[bradycardia|slow]] or [[irregular heart rate]], [[delusion]]s, [[hypertension]], new or increased [[angina pectoris]], and [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name=PillLabel/> Most of the side effects are due to a high dopamine signaling, and can be alleviated by reducing the dose of levodopa.<ref name="DrugNames" />

The main side effects of the patch form for depression include [[application site reaction|application-site reaction]]s, [[insomnia]], [[diarrhea]], and [[sore throat]].<ref name=PatchLabel/> The selegiline patch carries a [[boxed warning|black box warning]] about a possible increased risk of [[suicide]], especially for young people,<ref name="PatchLabel" /> as do all antidepressants since 2007.<ref name="pmid17485726">{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman RA, Leon AC | title = Expanding the black box - depression, antidepressants, and the risk of suicide | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 23 | pages = 2343–2346 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17485726 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078015 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== Interactions ==

Both the oral and patch forms come with strong warnings against combining selegiline with drugs that could produce [[serotonin syndrome]], such as [[SSRI]]s and the [[cough medicine]] [[dextromethorphan]].<ref name="PillLabel" /><ref name="PatchLabel" /><ref name="pmid9673855">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinonen EH, Myllylä V | title = Safety of selegiline (deprenyl) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9673855 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-199819010-00002 | s2cid = 9632549 }}</ref>  Selegiline in combination with the opioid analgesic [[pethidine]] is not recommended, as it can lead to severe adverse effects.<ref name="pmid9673855" /> Several other synthetic opioids such as [[tramadol]] and [[methadone]], as well as various [[triptan]]s, are contraindicated due to potential for serotonin syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |  vauthors = Csoti I, Storch A, Müller W, Jost WH | title=Drug interactions with selegiline versus rasagiline | journal=Basal Ganglia | series=Monoamine oxidase B Inhibitors | date=December 1, 2012 | pages=S27–S31 | doi=10.1016/j.baga.2012.06.003 | issn=2210-5336 | volume=2 | issue=4, Supplement }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillman PK | title = Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, opioid analgesics and serotonin toxicity | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 434–441 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16051647 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aei210 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Patch====
Following application of the patch to humans, an average of 25% to 30% of the selegiline content is delivered systemically over 24 hours. Transdermal dosing results in significantly higher exposure to selegiline and lower exposure to all metabolites when compared to oral dosing; this is due to the extensive first-pass metabolism of the pill form and low first-pass metabolism of the patch form. The site of application is not a significant factor in how the drug is distributed. In humans, selegiline does not accumulate in the skin, nor is it metabolized there.<ref name=PatchLabel/>

==Chemistry==
Selegiline belongs to the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class|chemical families]]. It is also known as <small>L</small>-deprenyl, as well as (''R'')-(–)-''N'',α-dimethyl-''N''-(2-propynyl)phenethylamine or (''R'')-(–)-''N''-methyl-''N''-2-propynylamphetamine. The compound is a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[levomethamphetamine]] (<small>L</small>-methamphetamine) with a [[propargyl]] [[functional group|group]] attached to the [[nitrogen]] [[atom]].

==History==
Following the discovery in 1952 that the [[tuberculosis]] drug [[iproniazid]] elevated the mood of people taking it, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of [[Monoamine oxidase|MAO]], many people and companies started trying to discover MAO inhibitors to use as antidepressants.

In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous "cheese effect" ([[hypertensive emergency|hypertensive crisis]] resulting from consuming [[foods containing tyramine]]) that occurs with non-selective MAO inhibitors. A few years later, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Prof. [[Moussa B.H. Youdim]], visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson's disease.<ref name=healy/><ref name="pmid1172524">{{cite journal | vauthors = Birkmayer W, Riederer P, Youdim MB, Linauer W | title = The potentiation of the anti akinetic effect after L-dopa treatment by an inhibitor of MAO-B, Deprenil | journal = Journal of Neural Transmission | volume = 36 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 303–326 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1172524 | doi = 10.1007/BF01253131 | url = http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00702/bibs/5036003/50360303.htm | url-status = dead | s2cid = 38179089 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130212002238/http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00702/bibs/5036003/50360303.htm | archive-date = 2013-02-12 }}</ref>

Joseph Knoll and his team are credited with having developed selegiline.

Knoll maintains that micro-doses of selegiline act as a synthetic analogue to a known or unknown [[trace amine]] in order to preserve the brain catecholaminergic system, which he perceives as integral to the organism's ability to function in an adaptive, goal-directed and motivated manner during advancing physical age:<blockquote>" ... enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic brain stem neurons play[s] a key role in controlling the uphill period of life and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The results of our longevity studies support the hypothesis that quality and duration of life rests upon the inborn efficiency of the catcholaminergic brain machinery, i.e. '''a high performing, long-living individual has a more active, more slowly deteriorating catecholaminergic system than its low performing, shorter living peer. Thus, a better brain engine allows for a better performance and a longer lifespan.'''

...

Since the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem are of key importance in ensuring that the mammalian organism works as a purposeful, motivated, goal-directed entity, it is hard to overestimate the significance of finding safe and efficient means to slow the decay of these systems with passing time. The conclusion that the maintenance on (-)-deprenyl that keeps the catecholaminergic neurnsn a higher activity level is a safe and efficient anti- aging therapy follows from the discovery of the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic neurons of the brain stem. From the finding that this regulation starts working on a high activity level after weaning and the enhanced activity subsists during the uphill period of life, until sexual hormones dampen the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem, and this event signifies the transition from developmental longevity into postdevelopmental longevity, the downhill period of life."<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>
