==Causes==
Although multiple hypotheses have been suggested as potential triggers that cause vitiligo, studies strongly imply that changes in the [[immune system]] are responsible for the condition.<ref name=Lancet2016>{{cite journal|last1=Ezzedine|first1=K|last2=Eleftheriadou|first2=V|last3=Whitton|first3=M|last4=van Geel|first4=N|title=Vitiligo.|journal=Lancet|date=4 July 2015|volume=386|issue=9988|pages=74–84|pmid=25596811|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60763-7|s2cid=208791128|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5975835/file/5975903}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ongenae|first1=Katia|last2=Van Geel|first2=Nanny|last3=Naeyaert|first3=Jean-Marie|title=Evidence for an Autoimmune Pathogenesis of Vitiligo|journal=Pigment Cell Research|date=Apr 2003|volume=16|issue=2|pages=90–100|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0749.2003.00023.x|pmid=12622785|doi-access=}}</ref> Vitiligo has been proposed to be a multifactorial disease with genetic susceptibility and environmental factors both thought to play a role.<ref name=Lancet2016/> It is hypothesized that damaging environmental factors can disrupt redox reactions necessary for protein folding, so skin cells may initiate the unfolded protein response which releases cytokines, thus mounting an immune response <ref name="Baldini 2017">{{cite journal |last1=Baldini |first1=Enke |last2=Odorisio |first2=Teresa |last3=Sorrenti |first3=Salvatore |last4=Catania |first4=Antonio |last5=Tartaglia |first5=Francesco |last6=Carbotta |first6=Giovanni |last7=Pironi |first7=Daniele |last8=Rendina |first8=Roberta |last9=D'Armiento |first9=Eleonora |last10=Persechino |first10=Severino |last11=Ulisse |first11=Salvatore |title=Vitiligo and Autoimmune Thyroid Disorders |journal=Frontiers in Endocrinology |date=27 October 2017 |volume=8 |issue=290 |page=290 |doi=10.3389/fendo.2017.00290 |pmid=29163360 |pmc=5663726 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Chang 2021">{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Wei-Ling |last2=Lee |first2=Woan-Ruoh |last3=Kuo |first3=Yung-Che |last4=Huang |first4=Yen-Hua |title=Vitiligo: An Autoimmune Skin Disease and its Immunomodulatory Therapeutic Intervention |journal=Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology |date=14 December 2021 |volume=9 |issue=797026 |doi=10.3389/fcell.2021.797026 |pmid=34970551 |pmc=8712646 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The [[National Institutes of Health]] states that some believe that [[sunburn]]s can cause or exacerbate the condition, but this idea is not well-supported by good evidence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Vitiligo|url=https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/vitiligo#tab-causes|access-date=22 July 2018|date=30 October 2016|publisher=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|archive-date=8 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808050044/http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/vitiligo/vitiligo.htm#tab-causes|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Immune ===
[[Melanin]] is the pigment that gives skin its color; it is produced by skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s.

Variations in genes that are part of the immune system or part of melanocytes have both been associated with vitiligo.<ref name="Lancet2016" /> It is also thought to be caused by the immune system attacking and destroying the melanocytes of the skin.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vitiligo/basics/causes/con-20032007|title = Vitiligo Causes|last = Staff|first = Mayo Clinic|publisher = Mayoclinic|date = 15 May 2014|access-date = 22 April 2015|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150430065653/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vitiligo/basics/causes/con-20032007|archive-date = 30 April 2015}}</ref> A genome wide association study found approximately 36 independent susceptibility [[locus (genetics)|loci]] for generalized vitiligo.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spritz|first1=Richard A.|title=Modern vitiligo genetics sheds new light on an ancient disease|journal=The Journal of Dermatology|date=May 2013|volume=40|issue=5|pages=310–18|doi=10.1111/1346-8138.12147|pmid=23668538|pmc=3783942}}</ref>

The TYR gene encodes the protein [[tyrosinase]], which is not a component of the immune system, but is an enzyme of the melanocyte that catalyzes melanin biosynthesis, and a major [[autoantigen]] in generalized vitiligo.<ref name="Lancet2016" />

=== Autoimmune associations ===
Vitiligo is sometimes associated with [[autoimmune]] and [[inflammatory disease]]s such as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], [[scleroderma]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]], [[psoriasis]], [[Addison's disease]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[alopecia areata]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[celiac disease]].<ref name=Lancet2016/><ref name=VanDriesscheSilverberg2015>{{cite journal | vauthors=Van Driessche F, Silverberg N | title=Current Management of Pediatric Vitiligo | journal=Paediatr Drugs | year=2015 | volume=17 | issue=4 | pages=303–13 | pmid=26022363 | doi=10.1007/s40272-015-0135-3 | s2cid=20038695 | type=Review }}</ref>

Among the inflammatory products of [[NLRP1]] are [[caspase 1]] and [[caspase 7]], which activate the inflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin-1 beta|interleukin-1β]]. Interleukin-1β and [[interleukin-18]] are expressed at high levels in people with vitiligo.<ref name=LamkanfiVandeWalle2011>{{cite journal| vauthors=Lamkanfi M, Vande Walle L, Kanneganti TD| title=Deregulated inflammasome signaling in disease. | journal=Immunol Rev | year= 2011 | volume= 243 | issue= 1 | pages= 163–73 | pmid=21884175 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01042.x | pmc=3170132 | type=Review }}</ref> In one of the mutations, the [[amino acid]] leucine in the NALP1 protein was replaced by [[histidine]] (Leu155&nbsp;→&nbsp;His).

=== Classification ===

Classification attempts to quantify vitiligo have been analyzed as being somewhat inconsistent,<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Vitiligo|editor1-last=Picardo|editor1-first=Mauro |editor2-last=Taïeb|editor2-first=Alain|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-69360-4}}</ref> while recent consensus have agreed to a system of segmental vitiligo (SV) and non-segmental vitiligo (NSV). NSV is the most common type of vitiligo.<ref name=Lancet2016 />

==== Non-segmental ====
In non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), there is usually some form of [[symmetry]] in the location of the patches of depigmentation. New patches also appear over time and can be generalized over large portions of the body or localized to a particular area. Extreme cases of vitiligo, to the extent that little pigmented skin remains, are referred to as ''vitiligo universalis''. NSV can come about at any age (unlike segmental vitiligo, which is far more prevalent in teenage years).<ref name="huggins"/>

Classes of non-segmental vitiligo include the following:

* Generalized vitiligo: the most common pattern, wide and randomly distributed areas of depigmentation<ref name="halder07">{{cite book |last=Halder |first=R. M. |chapter=Vitiligo |editor-last=Wolff |editor-first=K. |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine |edition=7th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-07-146690-5 |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}</ref>
* Universal vitiligo: depigmentation encompasses most of the body<ref name="halder07"/>
* Focal vitiligo: one or a few scattered macules in one area, most common in children<ref name="halder07"/>
* Acrofacial vitiligo: fingers and periorificial areas<ref name="halder07"/>
* Mucosal vitiligo: depigmentation of only the mucous membranes<ref name="halder07"/>

==== Segmental ====

Segmental vitiligo (SV) differs in appearance, cause, and frequency of associated illnesses. Its treatment is different from that of NSV. It tends to affect areas of skin that are associated with [[dorsal root]]s from the [[spinal cord]] and is most often unilateral.<ref name=Lancet2016/><ref name=VanGeel2012/> It is much more stable/static in course and its association with autoimmune diseases appears to be weaker than that of generalized vitiligo.<ref name=VanGeel2012>{{cite journal|vauthors=van Geel N, Mollet I, Brochez L, Dutré M, De Schepper S, Verhaeghe E, Lambert J, Speeckaert R |title=New insights in segmental vitiligo: case report and review of theories|journal=British Journal of Dermatology|volume=166|issue=2|pages=240–46|date=February 2012|pmid=21936857|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10650.x|s2cid=32746282 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/2117216/file/2956540 }}</ref> SV does not improve with topical therapies or UV light; however, surgical treatments such as cellular grafting can be effective.<ref name="huggins"/>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Chemical leukoderma is a similar condition due to multiple exposures to chemicals.<ref name=Andrew2020/> Vitiligo however is a risk factor.<ref name=Andrew2020/> Triggers may include inflammatory skin conditions, burns, intralesional steroid injections and abrasions.<ref name=Andrew2020/>

Other conditions with similar symptoms include the following:

* [[Albinism in humans|albinism]]
* [[halo nevus]]
* [[idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis]] (white sunspots)<ref name="halder07"/>
* [[piebaldism]]<ref name="halder07"/>
* [[pityriasis alba]]
* [[postinflammatory hypopigmentation]]
* [[primary adrenal insufficiency]]
* [[progressive macular hypomelanosis]]<ref name="halder07"/>
* [[tinea versicolor]]<ref name="halder07"/>
* [[tuberculoid leprosy]].

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for vitiligo but several treatment options are available.<ref name=Lancet2016/> The best evidence is for applied [[steroid]]s and [[ultraviolet light]] in combination with creams.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitton|first=ME|author2=Ashcroft, DM |author3=González, U |title=Therapeutic interventions for vitiligo.|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date=Oct 2008|volume=59|issue=4|pages=713–17|pmid=18793940|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.06.023}}</ref> Due to the higher risks of skin cancer, the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]] suggests phototherapy be used only if primary treatments are ineffective.<ref name="UK">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vitiligo/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=Vitiligo -Treatment|last=Anon|work=Patient UK|publisher=NHS|access-date=2013-06-03|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606020140/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vitiligo/Pages/Treatment.aspx|archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Lesions located on the hands, feet, and joints are the most difficult to repigment; those on the face are easiest to return to the natural skin color as the skin is thinner in nature.<ref name=Lancet2016/>

=== Immune mediators ===
Topical preparations of immune suppressing medications including [[glucocorticoids]] (such as 0.05% clobetasol or 0.10% betamethasone) and [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s (such as [[tacrolimus]] or [[pimecrolimus]]) are considered to be first-line vitiligo  treatments.<ref name=Lancet2016/>

In July 2022, [[ruxolitinib]] cream (sold under the brand name Opzelura) was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of vitiligo.<ref>{{cite web | title=Incyte Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Opzelura (ruxolitinib) Cream for the Treatment of Vitiligo | publisher=Incyte | via=Business Wire | date=19 July 2022 | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220718005819/en/Incyte-Announces-U.S.-FDA-Approval-of-Opzelura%E2%84%A2-ruxolitinib-Cream-for-the-Treatment-of-Vitiligo | access-date=19 July 2022 | archive-date=19 July 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220719011431/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220718005819/en/Incyte-Announces-U.S.-FDA-Approval-of-Opzelura%E2%84%A2-ruxolitinib-Cream-for-the-Treatment-of-Vitiligo/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Phototherapy ===
Phototherapy is considered a second-line treatment for vitiligo.<ref name=Lancet2016/> Exposing the skin to light from UVB lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo. The treatments can be done at home with an UVB lamp or in a clinic. The exposure time is managed so that the skin does not suffer overexposure. Treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face and if they existed not more than 3 years. If the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there for more than 3 years, it can take a few months. Phototherapy sessions are done 2–3 times a week. Spots on a large area of the body may require full body treatment in a clinic or hospital. UVB broadband and narrowband lamps can be used,<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid= 11369913 |year= 2001 |last1= Scherschun |first1= L |last2= Kim |first2= JJ |last3= Lim |first3= HW |title= Narrow-band ultraviolet B is a useful and well-tolerated treatment for vitiligo |volume= 44 |issue= 6 |pages= 999–1003 |doi= 10.1067/mjd.2001.114752 |journal= Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |s2cid= 17431219 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2005.02447.x |title= Treatment of vitiligo with broadband ultraviolet B and vitamins |year= 2006 |last1= Don |first1= Philip |last2= Iuga |first2= Aurel |last3= Dacko |first3= Anne |last4= Hardick |first4= Kathleen |journal= International Journal of Dermatology |volume= 45 |pages= 63–65 |pmid= 16426381 |issue= 1|s2cid= 454415 |doi-access= free }}</ref> but narrowband ultraviolet peaked around 311&nbsp;nm is the choice. It has been constitutively reported that a combination of UVB phototherapy with other topical treatments improves re-pigmentation. However, some people with vitiligo may not see any changes to skin or re-pigmentation occurring. A serious potential side effect involves the risk of developing skin cancer, the same risk as an overexposure to natural sunlight.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Ultraviolet light ([[Ultraviolet A|UVA]]) treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic. [[Psoralen]] and ultraviolet A light ([[PUVA]]) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, then exposing the skin to high doses of UVA light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6–12 months or longer. Because of the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling.<ref name="UK"/>

Narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy lacks the side-effects caused by psoralens and is as effective as PUVA.<ref name=Lancet2016/> As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and there is no need to use psoralen.<ref name="UK"/> Longer treatment is often recommended, and at least 6 months may be required for effects to phototherapy.<ref name=Ba2017>{{Cite journal|last1=Bae|first1=Jung Min|last2=Jung|first2=Han Mi|last3=Hong|first3=Bo Young|last4=Lee|first4=Joo Hee|last5=Choi|first5=Won Joon|last6=Lee|first6=Ji Hae|last7=Kim|first7=Gyong Moon|date=2017-07-01|title=Phototherapy for Vitiligo: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=153|issue=7|pages=666–74|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2017.0002|issn=2168-6068|pmid= 28355423|pmc=5817459}}</ref> NBUVB phototherapy appears better than PUVA therapy with the most effective response on the face and neck.<ref name=Ba2017/>

=== Skin camouflage ===
In mild cases, vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other [[cosmetic camouflage]] solutions. If the affected person is pale-skinned, the patches can be made less visible by avoiding [[sun tanning|tanning]] of unaffected skin.<ref name="halder07"/>

=== Depigmenting ===
In cases of extensive vitiligo the option to depigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like [[monobenzone]], [[mequinol]], or [[hydroquinone]] may be considered to render the skin an even color. The removal of all the skin pigment with [[monobenzone]] is permanent and vigorous. Sun-safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe [[sunburn]] and [[melanomas]]. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete.<ref name="UK"/>

== History ==
Descriptions of a disease believed to be vitiligo date back to a passage in the medical text [[Ebers Papyrus]] {{circa|1500 BC}} in ancient [[Egypt]]. Also, the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "[[Tzaraath]]" from the [[Old Testament]] book of [[Leviticus]]<ref name=Taieb/> dating to 1280&nbsp;BC<ref name=Kurzweil11>{{cite book |title=The Torah For Dummies |last=Kurzweil |first=Arthur |author-link=Arthur Kurzweil |year=2008 |publisher=For Dummies |isbn=978-0-470-28306-6 |page=11 |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04701734/0470173459.pdf |access-date=2010-08-19 |archive-date=22 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622201855/https://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04701734/0470173459.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> (or 1312&nbsp;BC<ref name=Timeline>[http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48944541.html History Crash Course #36: Timeline: From Abraham to Destruction of the Temple] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720164107/http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48944541.html |date=20 July 2014 }}, by Rabbi Ken Spiro, Aish.com. Retrieved 2010-08-19.</ref>) described a group of skin diseases associated with white spots, and a subsequent translation to Greek led to continued conflation of those with vitiligo with [[leprosy]] and spiritual uncleanliness.<ref name=Taieb/>

Medical sources in the ancient world such as [[Hippocrates]] often did not differentiate between vitiligo and leprosy, often grouping these diseases together. The name "vitiligo" was first used by the Roman physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in his classic medical text ''[[De Medicina]]''.<ref name=Taieb>{{cite book|last1=Gauthier|first1=Yvon|first2=Laila|last2=Benzekri|chapter=Historical Aspects|title=Vitiligo|editor1-last=Picardo|editor1-first=Mauro |editor2-last=Taïeb|editor2-first=Alain|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-69360-4|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref>

The term ''vitiligo'' is believed to be derived from "vitium", meaning "defect" or "blemish".<ref name="Taieb"/>

==Society and culture==

The change in appearance caused by vitiligo can affect a person's emotional and psychological well-being and may create difficulty in becoming or remaining employed, particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body, such as the face, hands or arms. Participating in a vitiligo support group may improve social coping skills and emotional resilience.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chaturvedi|first1=SK|last2=Singh|first2=G|last3=Gupta|first3=N|title=Stigma experience in skin disorders: an Indian perspective.|journal=Dermatologic Clinics|date=October 2005|volume=23|issue=4|pages=635–42|doi=10.1016/j.det.2005.05.007|pmid=16112439}}</ref>

The Adult Swim animated sitcom ''[[The Boondocks (2005 TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' satirizes the idea of vitiligo in [[Uncle Ruckus]], one of the show's characters. Ruckus, who is black, frequently claims to be white, often stating that he has "Re-vitiligo, the opposite of what Michael Jackson had." He frequently uses this argument to maintain that he is actually Caucasian, leading him to commit delusional and racist antics in nearly every episode.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marsh |first=Kris |date=2023-03-15 |title=Why I use 'The Boondocks' TV cartoon show to teach a course about race |url=http://theconversation.com/why-i-use-the-boondocks-tv-cartoon-show-to-teach-a-course-about-race-195060 |access-date=2024-01-08 |website=The Conversation |language=en-US}}</ref>

In October 1992, a scientific report was published of successfully transplanting [[melanocyte]]s to vitiligo-affected areas, effectively repigmenting the region.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson MJ, Juhlin L |title=Melanocyte transplantation in vitiligo |journal=Lancet |volume=340 |issue=8825 |page=981 |year=1992 |pmid=1357390 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92875-G |s2cid=19599682 }}</ref> The procedure involved taking a thin layer of pigmented skin from the person's [[Gluteal muscles|gluteal]] region. Melanocytes were then separated out to a [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] suspension that was expanded in culture. The area to be treated was then denuded with a [[Dermabrasion|dermabrader]] and the melanocytes [[Skin grafting|graft]] applied. Between 70 and 85 percent of people with vitiligo experienced nearly complete repigmentation of their skin. The longevity of the repigmentation differed from person to person.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson MJ, Juhlin L |title=Long-term follow-up of leucoderma patients treated with transplants of autologous cultured melanocytes, ultrathin epidermal sheets and basal cell layer suspension |journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|volume=147|issue=5 |pages=893–904 |year=2002 |pmid=12410698 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2002.04837.x|s2cid=42396825 }}</ref>

Current research suggests that the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT pathway) plays a crucial role in the loss of epidermal melanocytes. This pathway is activated by CXCR3+ CD8+ T cells, creating a positive-feedback loop with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) chemokines from keratinocytes, potentially contributing to vitiligo.<ref>Qi F, Liu F, Gao L.
