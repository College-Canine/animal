'''Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)''' is an uncommon [[autoimmune disease]] of the [[Stratum germinativum|basal cell layer]] of the [[skin]].  It occurs in humans<ref>[http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/discoid_lupus_eryt.html  American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, "Discoid Lupus Erythematosus"].</ref> and cats, more frequently occurring in [[dog]]s. It was first described in dogs by Griffin and colleagues in 1979.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=C.E.|last2=Stannard|first2=A.A.|last3=Ihrke|first3=P.J.|last4=Ardans|first4=A.A.|last5=Cello|first5=R.M.|last6=Bjorling|first6=D.R.|date=November 1979|title=Canine discoid lupus erythematosus|journal=Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79–87|doi=10.1016/0165-2427(79)90009-6|pmid=15612271}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Olivry|first1=Thierry|last2=Linder|first2=Keith E.|last3=Banovic|first3=Frane|date=December 2018|title=Cutaneous lupus erythematosus in dogs: a comprehensive review|journal=BMC Veterinary Research|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=132|doi=10.1186/s12917-018-1446-8|issn=1746-6148|pmc=5907183|pmid=29669547 |doi-access=free }}</ref> DLE is one form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).

==Symptoms==
[[Image:Canine discoid lupus 3.jpg|thumb|Canine discoid lupus erythematosus showing loss of noseprint, depigmentation, ulceration and tissue destruction - all characteristic of the syndrome]]The most common initial symptom is scaling and loss of pigment on the nose. The surface of the nose becomes smooth gray, and ulcerated, instead of the normal black cobblestone texture.  Over time the lips, the skin around the eyes, the ears, and the genitals may become involved.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhauser I, Strothmann-Lüerssen A, Baumgärtner W |title=A case of interface perianal dermatitis in a dog: is this an unusual manifestation of lupus erythematosus? |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=761–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16966456 |doi=10.1354/vp.43-5-761|s2cid=25729680 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  [[Lesion]]s may progress to [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] and lead to tissue destruction.  DLE is often worse in summer due to increased sun exposure.

==Diagnosis==
DLE is easily confused with [[Photodermatitis|solar dermatitis]], [[pemphigus]], [[ringworm]], and other types of dermatitis.  [[Biopsy]] is required to make the distinction.  [[Histopathology|Histopathologically]], there is [[inflammation]] at the [[Stratum germinativum|dermoepidermal junction]] and degeneration of the basal cell layer.<ref name=NAVC/>  Unlike in SLE, an [[anti-nuclear antibody]] test is usually negative.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>
