The '''Siberian Husky''' is a medium-sized [[Working dog|working]] [[sled dog]] [[dog breed|breed]]. The breed belongs to the [[Spitz]] genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred [[Coat (dog)|double coat]], erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking [[Alaskan Malamute]].

Siberian Huskies originated in [[Northeast Asia]] where they are bred by the [[Chukchi people]] of [[Siberia]] for sled pulling and companionship.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/Siberian-husky|title=Siberian husky {{!}} breed of dog|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to [[Nome, Alaska]], during the [[Nome Gold Rush]], initially as [[sled dogs]] to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.<ref name=":0" /> Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by [[Sled dog racing|competitive]] and recreational mushers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Do many Siberian Huskies run the Iditarod?

==Lineage==
{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}

In 2015, a [[DNA]] study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the [[Alaskan Malamute]] and the [[Alaskan husky]] share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two [[Canadian Eskimo Dog|Inuit dogs]], the [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] and the [[Greenland Dog]]. In [[North America]], the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with [[Europe]]an breeds.<ref name=brown2015/> Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian dogs and ancient [[Lake Baikal]] dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old.<ref name=Feuerborn2021>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.2100338118|title=Modern Siberian dog ancestry was shaped by several thousand years of Eurasian-wide trade and human dispersal|year=2021|last1=Feuerborn|first1=Tatiana R.|last2=Carmagnini|first2=Alberto|last3=Losey|first3=Robert J.|last4=Nomokonova|first4=Tatiana|last5=Askeyev|first5=Arthur|last6=Askeyev|first6=Igor|last7=Askeyev|first7=Oleg|last8=Antipina|first8=Ekaterina E.|last9=Appelt|first9=Martin|last10=Bachura|first10=Olga P.|last11=Beglane|first11=Fiona|last12=Bradley|first12=Daniel G.|last13=Daly|first13=Kevin G.|last14=Gopalakrishnan|first14=Shyam|last15=Murphy Gregersen|first15=Kristian|last16=Guo|first16=Chunxue|last17=Gusev|first17=Andrei V.|last18=Jones|first18=Carleton|last19=Kosintsev|first19=Pavel A.|last20=Kuzmin|first20=Yaroslav V.|last21=Mattiangeli|first21=Valeria|last22=Perri|first22=Angela R.|last23=Plekhanov|first23=Andrei V.|last24=Ramos-Madrigal|first24=Jazmín|last25=Schmidt|first25=Anne Lisbeth|last26=Shaymuratova|first26=Dilyara|last27=Smith|first27=Oliver|last28=Yavorskaya|first28=Lilia V.|last29=Zhang|first29=Guojie|last30=Willerslev|first30=Eske|last31=Meldgaard|first31=Morten|last32=Gilbert|first32=M.

Several [[Arctic]] dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct [[Origin of the domestic dog#Late Pleistocene wolf admixture|Taimyr]] wolf of [[North Asia]] due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. These breeds are associated with high latitudes – the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the [[Shar-Pei]] and [[Finnish Spitz]]. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1 and 3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with [[phenotypic variation]] beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.019| title = Ancient Wolf Genome Reveals an Early Divergence of Domestic Dog Ancestors and Admixture into High-Latitude Breeds| journal = Current Biology| year = 2015| last1 = Skoglund | first1 = P. | last2 = Ersmark | first2 = E. | last3 = Palkopoulou | first3 = E.| last4 = Dalén | first4 = L. | pmid=26004765 | volume=25 | issue = 11| pages=1515–9| doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Description==
===Coat===
[[File:Siberian Husky sable.jpg|thumb|Sable female Siberian Husky]]
A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds.<ref name="meet">{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/#standard |title=AKC Meet The Breeds: Siberian Husky |publisher=[[American Kennel Club|AKC.org]] |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref> It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy [[Fur#Down hair|undercoat]] and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight [[Fur#guard hair|guard hair]]s.<ref name="Get to Know the Siberian Husky">[http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/#standard "Get to Know the Siberian Husky"], 'The American Kennel Club', Retrieved 29 May 2014</ref> It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as {{convert|-50|to|-60|C|F}}. The undercoat is often absent during [[Moult|shedding]]. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.<ref name="meet"/> An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a "wooly" or "woolie" coat, is considered a [[Fault (breeding)|fault]] by the breed's standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Siberian Husky Dog Breed Information|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/|access-date=2022-02-15|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref>

Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and [[patterns]], often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare "[[Agouti (coloration)|agouti]]" coat, though many individuals have blondish or [[piebald]] spotting. Some other individuals also have the "saddle back" pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed.<ref name="Get to Know the Siberian Husky"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/270g05-en.pdf|title=FCI-Standard N° 270 – Siberian Husky|date=January 2000|website=Federation Cynologique Internationale (AISBL)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ckc.ca/CanadianKennelClub/media/Breed-Standards/Group%203/Siberian-Husky.pdf|title=Siberian Husky Breed Standard|date=January 2016|website=Canadian Kennel Club}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukcdogs.com/siberian-husky|title=Siberian Husky Breed Standard|website=United Kennel Club}}</ref> [[Merle (dog coat)|Merle]] coat patterns are not permitted by the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) and [[The Kennel Club]] (KC).<ref name="Get to Know the Siberian Husky" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=5141|title=Siberian Husky Breed Standard|date=February 2017|website=The Kennel Club}}</ref> This pattern is often associated with health issues and impure breeding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shca.org/shcahp5a.htm|title=Coat Color Identification Guidelines & Statement on "Merle" Patterning in Siberians|date=September 2018|website=Siberian Husky Club of America Inc.}}</ref>

===Eyes===
[[File:Siberian Husky copper bi-eye.jpg|thumb|Red and white Siberian Husky with [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]]]
The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely". The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable (complete is [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]). These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not affect the vision of the dog.<ref name=akc>{{cite web|title=American Kennel Club:Official Standard of the Siberian Husky|url=http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/americankennelclub/SiberianHusky.pdf|website=American Kennel Club|access-date=24 May 2015}}</ref>

===Nose===
Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called "snow nose" or "winter nose". This condition is called [[hypopigmentation]] in animals. "Snow nose" is acceptable in the show ring.<ref name="meet"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siberianhuskyclub.com/faq/viewsection?sectionID=1&sectionName=Health#12 |title=Common Husky Questions – Siberian Husky Club of Great Britain – Huskies UK |publisher=Siberianhuskyclub.com |access-date=February 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404205533/http://www.siberianhuskyclub.com/faq/viewsection?sectionID=1&sectionName=Health#12 |archive-date=April 4, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Tail===
Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the "Siberian Swirl". The AKC recommends the tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a "sickle" shape when excited or interested in something.<ref name="meet"/>

===Size===
The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between {{convert|20|and|24|in|cm}} tall at the [[Withers#Dogs|withers]] and weighing between {{convert|45|and|60|lb|kg|abbr=}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Siberian husky |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/Siberian-husky |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref> Females are smaller, growing to between {{convert|19|and|23|in|cm}} tall at the [[withers]] and weighing between {{convert|35|and|50|lb|kg|abbr=}}.<ref name="meet"/> The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as "Siberian Rats" due to their size of {{cvt|40|-|50|lb}}, versus the Alaskan Malamute's size of {{cvt|75|-|85|lb}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.org/shcahp2d.htm|title=The Siberian Husky: A Brief History of the Breed in America|website=Shca.org|access-date=2016-03-16|archive-date=2020-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111222856/http://www.shca.org/shcahp2d.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Prehistoric (prior to 1890s) ===
The [[Chukotka sled dog|Chukotka Sled Dog]] is considered the progenitor to the Siberian Husky. Developed by the [[Chukchi people]] of Russia, Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pulls sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic [[Drift ice|pack ice]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{cite web|date=December 2006|title=An iceman's best friend|url=http://www.geographical.co.uk/magazine/an_icemans_best_friend_-_dec_06.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028163832/http://www.geographical.co.uk/magazine/an_icemans_best_friend_-_dec_06.html|archive-date=2014-10-28|access-date=2013-11-19|publisher=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]]}}</ref>

=== Origination of Name and Split from Chukotka Sled Dogs (1890s–1930s) ===

On February 3, 1925, [[Gunnar Kaasen]] was the final musher in the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] to deliver [[diphtheria]] serum from [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], over 600 miles to Nome. This was a group effort by several sled dog teams and mushers, with the longest (264 miles or 422&nbsp;km) and most dangerous segment of the run covered by [[Leonhard Seppala]] and his sled team lead dog [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]. The event is depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Togo (film)|Togo]]''. A measure of this is also depicted in the 1995 animated film ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''; the name of Gunnar Kaasen's lead dog in his sled team was [[Balto]], although unlike the real dog, [[Balto (character)|Balto the character]] was portrayed as a [[wolf-dog hybrid|wolf-dog]] in the film. In honor of this lead dog, [[Statue of Balto|a bronze statue]] was erected at [[Central Park]] in New York City. The plaque upon it is inscribed, <blockquote>Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925. Endurance · Fidelity · Intelligence<ref name="Beverly Pisano" /></blockquote>
Siberian huskies gained mass popularity with the story of the "Great Race of Mercy", the 1925 serum run to Nome, featuring Balto and Togo. Although Balto is considered the more famous, being the dog that delivered the serum to Nome after running the final 53-mile leg, it was Togo who made the longest run of the relay, guiding his musher Leonhard Seppala on a 261-mile journey that included crossing the deadly [[Norton Sound]] to Golovin,<ref>{{Citation |last=Gay |first=Salisbury |title=The cruelest miles : the heroic story of dogs and men in a race against an epidemic |date=2003 |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/671699744 |publisher=Random House Audio |isbn=0-553-52763-0 |oclc=671699744 |access-date=2021-10-02}}</ref> and who ultimately became a foundation dog for the Siberian Husky breed, through his progeny Toto, Molinka, Kingeak, Ammoro, Sepp III, and Togo II.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Bob |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/931927411 |title=Leonhard Seppala: the Siberian dog and the golden age of sleddog racing 1908–1941 |date=2015 |publisher=Pictorial Histories Publishing Company |isbn=978-1-57510-170-5 |oclc=931927411}}</ref>

Many of the dogs were bred and trained at Chinook Kennels in New Hampshire, owned by Eva Seeley.

Due to their high popularity combining with their high physical and mental needs, Siberians are abandoned or surrendered to shelters at high rates by new owners who do not research them fully and find themselves unable to care for them. Many decide on the breed for their looks and mythos in pop culture, and purchase pups from backyard breeders or puppy mills who do not have breeder-return contracts that responsible breeders will, designed to keep the breed out of shelters.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Mary Robins|title=How Game of Thrones has Impacted — And Hurt — Siberian Huskies|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/how-game-of-thrones-has-impacted-and-hurt-siberian-huskies/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref>

Sled dogs that were [[Chukotka sled dog|bred and kept by the Chukchi]] tribes of Siberia were thought to have gone extinct, but [[Benedict Allen]], writing for ''[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]]'' magazine in 2006 after visiting the region, reported their survival. His description of the breeding practiced by the Chukchi mentions selection for obedience, endurance, amiable disposition, and sizing that enabled families to support them without undue difficulty.<ref name=":2" />

Originally, huskies were used as [[sled dog]]s in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other [[dog type]]s by their fast pulling-style. Modern racing huskies (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing [[Dog crossbreed|crossbreed]] of the fastest dogs. Humans use huskies in [[sled-dog racing]]. Various companies]have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-01-14|title=How Sled Dogs Work|url=https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/snow-sports/sled-dog.htm|access-date=2021-12-24|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en}}</ref> Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keith|first=Christie|date=2011-02-18|title=Lessons from a sled dog massacre|url=https://www.sfgate.com/pets/yourwholepet/article/Lessons-from-a-sled-dog-massacre-2380720.php|access-date=2021-12-24|website=SFGATE|language=en-US}}</ref>

Many huskies, especially Siberian Huskies, are considered "working dogs" and often are high energy. Exercise is extremely important for the physical and mental health of these kinds of dogs and it can also prompt a strong bond between the owner and dog.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Siberian Husky Dog Breed Information|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/|access-date=2021-12-24|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref> Since many owners now have huskies as pets in settings that are not ideal for sledding, other activities have been found that are good for the dog and fun for the owner.

This activity allows the owner and dog to gain exercise without using the huskies' strong sense of pulling. Some companies make hiking equipment especially for dogs in which they may carry their own gear, including water, food, and bowls for each.
*[[Carting]], also known as dryland mushing or sulky driving, is an urban alternative to dog sledding. Here, the dog can pull a cart that contains either supplies or an individual. This is also an acceptable way to use a dog's natural inclination to pull in an effective way.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Penny Leigh|title=More Sports for All Dogs: Drafting & Carting|url=https://www.akc.org/canine-partners/more-sports-for-all-dogs-drafting-carting-2/|access-date=2021-04-10|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref> These carts can be bought or handmade by the individual.
*[[Mushing#Bikejoring|Bikejoring]] is an activity where the owner bikes along with their dog while they are attached to their bike through a harness which keeps both the dog and owner safe.
