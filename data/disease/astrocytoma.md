'''Astrocytoma''' is a type of [[brain tumor]]. Astrocytomas (also astrocytomata) originate from a specific kind of star-shaped [[glia]]l cell in the [[cerebrum]] called an [[astrocyte]]. This type of tumor does not usually spread outside the brain and spinal cord and it does not usually affect other organs. After [[glioblastoma]]s, astrocytomas are the second most common [[glioma]] and can occur in most parts of the brain and occasionally in the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-astrocytoma | title= What Is Astrocytoma?
| website= WebMD |access-date= 1 July 2021}}</ref>

Within the astrocytomas, two broad classes are recognized in literature, those with:
* Narrow zones of infiltration (mostly noninvasive tumors; e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma), that often are clearly outlined on diagnostic images
* Diffuse zones of [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]] (e.g., high-grade astrocytoma), that share various features, including the ability to arise at any location in the central nervous system, but with a preference for the cerebral hemispheres; they occur usually in adults, and have an intrinsic tendency to progress to more advanced grades.<ref name=EMedicine283453>{{EMedicine|article|283453|Astrocytoma}}</ref>

People can develop astrocytomas at any age. The low-grade type is more often found in children or young adults, while the high-grade type is more prevalent in adults. Astrocytomas in the base of the brain are more common in young people and account for roughly 75% of neuroepithelial tumors.<ref name="Astrocytoma">{{cite web | url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/astrocytoma/ | title= Astrocytoma | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library |access-date= 1 July 2021}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Astrocytoma causes regional effects by compression, invasion, and destruction of brain [[parenchyma]], arterial and venous hypoxia, competition for nutrients, release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.<ref name=EMedicine283453/> Secondary clinical sequelae may be caused by elevated [[intracranial pressure]]  attributable to direct mass effect, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid volume.<ref name=EMedicine283453/>

===Genetic and Molecular alterations===
Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is the main feature of high grade astrocytoma. In addition, a genome-wide pattern of DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) has been uncovered, which is correlated with a patient's survival and response to treatment. This pattern identifies among lower-grade astrocytoma patients a subtype, where the CNA genotype is correlated with an approximately one-year survival phenotype.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=C. H.

==Diagnosis==
An [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)  scan is necessary to characterize the extent of these tumors (size, location, consistency). CT will usually show distortion of third and lateral ventricles with displacement of anterior and middle cerebral arteries.  Histologic analysis is necessary for grading diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

In the first stage of diagnosis the doctor will take a history of symptoms and perform a basic neurological exam, including an eye exam and tests of vision, balance, coordination, and mental status. The doctor will then require a CT scan and MRI of the patient's brain. During a CT scan, X-rays of the patient's brain are taken from many different directions. These are then combined by a computer, producing a cross-sectional image of the brain. For an MRI, the patient relaxes in a tunnel-like instrument while the brain is subjected to changes of magnetic field. An image is produced based on the behavior of the brain's water molecules in response to the magnetic fields. A special dye may be injected into a vein before these scans to provide contrast and make tumors easier to identify.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

If a tumor is found,  a neurosurgeon must perform a biopsy on it. This simply involves the removal of a small amount of tumor tissue, which is then sent to a neuropathologist for examination and grading. The biopsy may take place before surgical removal of the tumor or the sample may be taken during surgery. Grading of the tumor sample is a method of classification that helps the doctor to determine the severity of the astrocytoma and to decide on the best treatment options. The neuropathologist grades the tumor by looking for atypical cells, the growth of new blood vessels, and for indicators of cell division called mitotic figures.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Grading===
Of numerous [[Grading of the tumors of the central nervous system|grading systems]] in use for the classification of tumor of the central nervous system, the [[World Health Organization]] [[Grading of the tumors of the central nervous system#WHO grading|(WHO) grading system]] is commonly used for astrocytoma.  Established in 1993 in an effort to eliminate confusion regarding diagnoses, the WHO system established a four-tiered histologic grading guideline for astrocytomas that assigns a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the least aggressive and 4 being the most aggressive.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The WHO grading scheme is based on the appearance of certain characteristics: [[atypia]], [[mitosis]], endothelial proliferation, and [[necrosis]]. These features reflect the malignant potential of the tumor in terms of invasion and growth rate. <!-- change in numbering - typo? Tumors without any of these features are grade I, and those with one of these features (usually atypia) are grade II. Tumors with 2 criteria and tumors with 3 or 4 criteria are WHO grades III and IV, respectively. Thus, the low-grade group of astrocytomas is graded I and II.{{cn}}

Various types of astrocytomas are given these WHO grades:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! WHO grade
! Astrocytomas
! Description
|-
| I
|
* [[Pilocytic astrocytoma]]
* [[Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma]]
* [[Subependymoma]]
| Consist of slow-growing astrocytomas, benign, and associated with long-term survival.  Individuals with very slow-growing tumors where complete surgical removal by [[stereotactic surgery]] is possible may experience total remission.<ref name=mdguidelines>[http://www.mdguidelines.com/astrocytoma mdguidelines.com Astrocytoma] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130043552/http://www.mdguidelines.com/astrocytoma |date=2017-11-30 }} Retrieved on Mars 26, 2010</ref> Even if the surgeon is not able to remove the entire tumor, it may remain inactive or be successfully treated with radiation.
|-
| II
|
* Low-grade ([[fibrillary astrocytoma|fibrillary]]) astrocytoma
* [[Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma]]
* Mixed oligoastrocytoma
| Consist of relatively slow-growing astrocytomas, usually considered benign that sometimes evolve into more malignant or as higher grade tumors. They are prevalent in younger people who often present with seizures. Median survival varies with the cell type of the tumor. Grade 2 astrocytomas are defined as being invasive gliomas, meaning that the tumor cells penetrate into the surrounding normal brain, making a surgical cure more difficult. People with [[oligodendroglioma]]s (which might share common cells of origin<ref name=evolutionGliomas>{{cite journal |last1=Ohgaki |first1=Hiroko |last2=Kleihues |first2=Paul |title=Genetic alterations and signaling pathways in the evolution of gliomas |journal=Cancer Science |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=2235–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19737147 |doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01308.x |s2cid=16742915 |doi-access=free }}</ref>) have better prognoses than those with mixed oligoastrocytomas, who in turn have better prognoses than patients with (pure) low-grade astrocytomas. Other factors which influence survival include age (younger the better) and performance status (ability to perform tasks of daily living). Due to the infiltrative nature of these tumors, recurrences are relatively common. Depending on the patient, radiation or chemotherapy after surgery is an option. Individuals with grade 2 astrocytoma have a 5-year survival rate of about 34% without treatment and about 70% with radiation therapy.<ref name=mdguidelines/> The median survival time is 4 years.<ref name=mdguidelines/>
|-
| III
| 
* [[Anaplastic astrocytoma]]
| Consist of anaplastic astrocytomas. It is often related to seizures, neurologic deficits, headaches, or changes in mental status. The standard initial treatment is to remove as much of the tumor as possible without worsening neurologic deficits. [[Radiation therapy]] has been shown to prolong survival and is a standard component of treatment. Individuals with grade 3 astrocytoma have a median survival time of 18 months without treatment (radiation and chemotherapy).<ref name=mdguidelines/> There is no proven benefit to adjuvant [[chemotherapy]] or supplementing other treatments for this kind of tumor. Although [[temozolomide]] is effective for treating recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, its role as an adjuvant to radiation therapy has not been fully tested.
|-
| IV
|
* Grade 4 Astrocytoma
| Consists of grade 4 astrocytoma (as of WHO 2021) that form following high-grade transformation of low-grade astrocytoma. These are more common in younger patients (mean age 45 versus 62 years).<ref name=evolutionGliomas /> Surgical removal remains the mainstay of treatment, provided that unacceptable neurologic injury can be avoided. The extremely infiltrative nature of this tumor makes complete surgical removal impossible. Although radiotherapy rarely cures glioblastoma, studies show that it doubles the median survival of patients, compared to supportive care alone.<ref name="mainstay">{{Cite web |title=Glioma - Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350251 |website=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> The prognosis is worst for these grade 4 gliomas. Few patients survive beyond 3 years. Individuals with grade 4 astrocytoma have a median survival time of 17<ref name=mdguidelines/> weeks without treatment, 30<ref name=mdguidelines/> weeks with radiation, and 37<ref name=mdguidelines/> weeks with surgical removal of most of the tumor followed by radiation therapy. Long-term survival (at least five years) falls well under 3%.<ref name=Buckner>{{cite journal |last1=Buckner |first1=Jan C. |last2=Brown |first2=Paul D. |last3=O'Neill |first3=Brian P. |last4=Meyer |first4=Fredric B. |last5=Wetmore |first5=Cynthia J. |last6=Uhm |first6=Joon H. |title=Central Nervous System Tumors |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=82 |issue=10 |pages=1271–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17908533 |doi=10.4065/82.10.1271 }}</ref><ref name=CBTRUS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbtrus.org/|title=CBTRUS - CBTRUS|website=CBTRUS}}</ref>

According to the WHO data, the lowest grade astrocytomas (grade I) make up only 2% of recorded astrocytomas, grade II 8%, and the higher grade anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III) 20%. The highest graded astrocytoma (grade IV GBM) is the most common primary [[nervous system neoplasm|nervous system cancer]] and second most frequent brain tumor after brain metastasis.  Despite the low incidence of astrocytomas compared to other human cancers, mortality is significant, as the higher grades (III & IV) present high mortality rates (mainly due to late detection of the neoplasm).{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

==Prevention==
There are no precise guidelines because the exact cause of astrocytoma is not known.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==Treatment==
[[File:Management of IDH-mutant glioma.png|thumb|Management of IDH-mutant gliomas, with astrocytomas at center and right.<ref name=Weller2020/>]]
For low-grade astrocytomas, removal of the tumor generally allows functional survival for many years. In some reports, the 5-year survival has been over 90% with well-resected tumors. Indeed, broad intervention of low-grade conditions is a contested matter.  In particular, [[pilocytic astrocytoma]]s are commonly indolent bodies that may permit normal neurologic function. However, left unattended, these tumors may eventually undergo neoplastic transformation. To date, complete resection of high-grade astrocytomas is impossible because of the diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into normal parenchyma.  Thus, high-grade astrocytomas inevitably recur after initial surgery or therapy and are usually treated similarly to the initial tumor. Despite decades of therapeutic research, curative intervention is still nonexistent for high-grade astrocytomas; patient care ultimately focuses on [[palliative]] management.<ref name="Astrocytoma"/>
