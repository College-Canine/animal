'''Calcium oxalate''' (in archaic terminology, '''oxalate of lime''') is a [[calcium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[oxalic acid]] with the chemical formula {{chem2|CaC2O4}} or {{chem2|Ca(COO)2}}. It forms hydrates {{chem2|CaC2O4*''n''H2O}}, where ''n'' varies from 1 to 3. Anhydrous and all hydrated forms are colorless or white. The monohydrate {{chem2|CaC2O4*H2O}} occurs naturally as the mineral [[whewellite]], forming envelope-shaped crystals, known in plants as [[raphide]]s. The two rarer hydrates are dihydrate {{chem2|CaC2O4*2H2O}}, which occurs naturally as the mineral [[weddellite]], and trihydrate {{chem2|CaC2O4*3H2O}}, which occurs naturally as the mineral [[caoxite]], are also recognized. Some foods have high quantities of calcium oxalates and can produce sores and numbing on ingestion and may even be fatal. Cultural groups with diets that depend highly on fruits and vegetables high in calcium oxalate, such as those in [[Pandanus_tectorius#Uses|Micronesia]], reduce the level of it by boiling and cooking them.<ref name=Arno14>{{Citation |mode=cs1 |last1=Arnold |first1=Michael A. |year=2014 |title=''Pandanus tectorius'' S.

The [[poison]]ous plant dumb cane (''[[Dieffenbachia]]'') contains the substance and on ingestion can prevent speech and be suffocating. It is also found in [[sorrel]], [[rhubarb]] (in large quantities in the leaves), [[cinnamon]], [[turmeric]] and in species of ''[[Oxalis]]'', [[Araceae]], ''[[Arum italicum]]'', [[taro]], [[kiwifruit]], tea leaves, [[agave]]s, Virginia creeper (''[[Parthenocissus quinquefolia]]''), and ''[[Alocasia]]'' and in [[spinach]] in varying amounts. Plants of the genus ''[[Philodendron]]'' contain enough calcium oxalate that consumption of parts of the plant can result in uncomfortable symptoms. Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found in plant stems, roots, and leaves and produced in [[idioblast]]s. [[Vanilla]] plants exude calcium oxalates upon harvest of the orchid seed pods and may cause [[contact dermatitis]].

Calcium oxalate, as '''‘beerstone’''', is a brownish precipitate that tends to accumulate within vats, barrels, and other containers used in the brewing of beer. If not removed in a cleaning process, beerstone will leave an unsanitary surface that can harbour microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtohomebrewbeers.com/2018/05/beerstone-removal.html|title=What is beerstone (and how to remove it)|access-date=28 May 2018|last=Ryan|first=James|date=27 May 2018}}</ref> Beerstone is composed of calcium and magnesium salts and various organic compounds left over from the brewing process; it promotes the growth of unwanted microorganisms that can adversely affect or even ruin the flavour of a batch of beer.

Calcium oxalate crystals in the urine are the most common constituent of human [[kidney stones]], and calcium oxalate crystal formation is also one of the toxic effects of [[ethylene glycol poisoning]].

== Chemical properties ==
Calcium oxalate is a combination of calcium ions and the conjugate base of [[oxalic acid]], the oxalate anion. Its aqueous solutions are slightly basic because of the basicity of the oxalate ion. The basicity of calcium oxalate is weaker than that of [[sodium oxalate]], due to its lower solubility in water. Solid calcium oxalate hydrate has been characterized by [[X-ray crystallography]]. It is a [[coordination polymer]] featuring planar oxalate anions linked to calcium, which also has water [[ligand]]s.<ref name=Acta>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Crystallogr. B|year=1981|volume=37|issue=4|pages=826–829|title=The Structure of Whewellite, CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>.</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O, at 328 K|author=S. Deganello|doi=10.1107/S056774088100441X|doi-access=}}</ref>

==Medical significance==
Calcium oxalate can produce sores and numbing on ingestion and may even be fatal.

===Morphology and diagnosis===
The monohydrate and dihydrate can be distinguished by the shape of the respective crystals. 
* Calcium oxalate ''dihydrate'' crystals are [[Octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]]. A large portion of the crystals in a urine sediment will have this type of morphology, as they can grow at any pH and naturally occur in normal urine.
* Calcium oxalate ''monohydrate'' crystals vary in shape, and can be shaped like dumbbells, spindles, ovals, or picket fences, the last of which is most commonly seen due to [[ethylene glycol poisoning]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Urine Crystals|url=https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/clinpath/modules/UA-ROUT/crystsed.htm|website=ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref>

Some of the oxalate in urine is produced by the body. Calcium and oxalate in the diet play a part but are not the only factors that affect the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Dietary oxalate is an organic ion found in many vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Calcium from bone may also play a role in kidney stone formation.

In one study of modulators of calcium oxalate crystallization in urine, magnesium-[[alkali citrate]] was shown to inhibit CaOx (calcium oxalate) crystallization, “probably via actions of the citrate, but not the Mg.” This was in comparison to magnesium, citrate, and magnesium citrate. Currently the preparation of magnesium-potassium citrate that was used in one positive study is not available in the United States. <ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schwille |first1=P.
