==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Meningioma seen at autopsy.jpg|thumb|Meningioma seen at autopsy, as a tumor of the [[dura mater]] extending into the cranial cavity, and can be detached from the bone along with the rest of the dura mater]]
Small tumors (e.g., <&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;cm) usually are incidental findings at [[autopsy]] without having caused symptoms. Larger tumors may cause symptoms, depending on the size and location.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}
* [[Focal seizure]]s may be caused by meningiomas that overlie the [[cerebrum]].
* Progressive spastic weakness in legs and incontinence may be caused by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
* Tumors of the [[cerebral aqueduct|Sylvian aqueduct]] may cause myriad motor, sensory, aphasic, and seizure symptoms, depending on the location.
* [[intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|Increased intracranial pressure]] eventually occurs, but is less frequent than in [[glioma]]s.
* [[Diplopia]] (Double vision) or uneven pupil size may be symptoms if related pressure causes a third and/or sixth nerve palsy.

92% of meningiomas are benign. 8% are either atypical or malignant.<ref name=Lee2008/>

===Genetics===
The most frequent genetic mutations (~50%) involved in meningiomas are inactivation mutations in the [[neurofibromatosis 2]] [[gene]] (merlin) on [[chromosome 22]]q.<ref name="Bachir Shah Shapiro Koehler 2021 p. 690"/>

''TRAF7'' mutations are present in about one-fourth of meningiomas. Mutations in the ''[[TNF receptor associated factor|TRAF7]]'', ''[[KLF4]]'', ''[[AKT1]]'', and ''[[Smoothened|SMO]]'' genes are commonly expressed in benign skull-base meningiomas.

===Observation===
Observation with close imaging follow-up may be used in select cases if a meningioma is small and asymptomatic.

In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yano S, Kuratsu J | title = Indications for surgery in patients with asymptomatic meningiomas based on an extensive experience | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 105 | issue = 4 | pages = 538–543 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17044555 | doi = 10.3171/jns.2006.105.4.538 | s2cid = 40577595 }}</ref> Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients developed symptoms later, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent morbid condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related morbid condition.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Observation is not recommended in tumors already causing symptoms. Furthermore, close follow-up with imaging is required with an observation strategy to rule out an enlarging tumor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olivero WC, Lister JR, Elwood PW | title = The natural history and growth rate of asymptomatic meningiomas: a review of 60 patients | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 222–224 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7616265 | doi = 10.3171/jns.1995.83.2.0222 | doi-access =  }}</ref>

===Surgery===
Meningiomas usually can be surgically [[resection (surgery)|resected]] (removed) and result in a permanent cure if the tumor is superficial on the [[Dura mater|dural]] surface and easily accessible. Transarterial [[embolization]] has become a standard preoperative procedure in the preoperative management.<ref name="pmid15355012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dowd CF, Halbach VV, Higashida RT | title = Meningiomas: the role of preoperative angiography and embolization | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = E10 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 15355012 | doi = 10.3171/foc.2003.15.1.10 |url=http://www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/july03/15-1-10.pdf |access-date=2007-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110093430/http://www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/july03/15-1-10.pdf |archive-date=2007-01-10 }}</ref> If invasion of the adjacent bone occurs, total removal is nearly impossible. It is rare for benign meningiomas to become [[malignant]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

The probability of a tumor recurring or growing after surgery may be estimated by comparing the tumor's WHO (World Health Organization) grade and by the extent of surgery by the Simpson Criteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson D | title = The recurrence of intracranial meningiomas after surgical treatment | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–39 | date = February 1957 | pmid = 13406590 | pmc = 497230 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.20.1.22 }}</ref>

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation therapy may include photon-beam or proton-beam treatment, or [[Radiation therapy|fractionated external beam radiation]].  Radiosurgery may be used in lieu of surgery in small tumors located away from critical structures.<ref name="pmid17695387">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kollová A, Liscák R, Novotný J, Vladyka V, Simonová G, Janousková L | title = Gamma Knife surgery for benign meningioma | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–336 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17695387 | doi = 10.3171/JNS-07/08/0325 }}</ref> Fractionated external-beam radiation also can be used as primary treatment for tumors that are surgically unresectable or, for patients who are inoperable for medical reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Radiation therapy often is considered for WHO grade I meningiomas after subtotal (incomplete) tumor resections. The clinical decision to irradiate after a subtotal resection is somewhat controversial, as no class I randomized, controlled trials exist on the subject.<ref name="pmid3403313">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor BW, Marcus RB, Friedman WA, Ballinger WE, Million RR | title = The meningioma controversy: postoperative radiation therapy | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 299–304 | date = August 1988 | pmid = 3403313 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-3016(98)90008-6 }}</ref> Numerous retrospective studies, however, have suggested strongly that the addition of postoperative radiation to incomplete resections improves both progression-free survival (i.e. prevents tumor recurrence) and improves overall survival.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldsmith BJ, Wara WM, Wilson CB, Larson DA | title = Postoperative irradiation for subtotally resected meningiomas. A retrospective analysis of 140 patients treated from 1967 to 1990 | journal = Journal of Neurosurgery | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–201 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8283256 | doi = 10.3171/jns.1994.80.2.0195 }}</ref>

In the case of a  grade III meningioma, the current standard of care involves postoperative radiation treatment regardless of the degree of surgical resection.<ref name="pmid10656373">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goyal LK, Suh JH, Mohan DS, Prayson RA, Lee J, Barnett GH | title = Local control and overall survival in atypical meningioma: a retrospective study | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–61 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10656373 | doi = 10.1016/S0360-3016(99)00349-1 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  This is due to the proportionally higher rate of local recurrence for these higher-grade tumors.  Grade II tumors may behave variably and there is no standard of whether to give radiotherapy following a gross total resection. Subtotally resected grade II tumors should be radiated.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

===Chemotherapy===
Likely, current chemotherapies are not effective. [[Antiprogestin]] agents have been used, but with variable results.<ref name="pmid15006250">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wahab M, Al-Azzawi F | title = Meningioma and hormonal influences | journal = Climacteric | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 285–292 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 15006250 | doi = 10.1080/cmt.6.4.285.292 | s2cid = 27776126 }}</ref> A 2007 study of whether [[hydroxyurea]] has the capacity to shrink unresectable or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton HB | title = Hydroxyurea chemotherapy in the treatment of meningiomas | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = E11 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17961035 | doi = 10.3171/foc-07/10/e11 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Many individuals have meningiomas, but remain asymptomatic, so the meningiomas are discovered during an autopsy. One to two percent of all autopsies reveal meningiomas that were unknown to the individuals during their lifetime, since there were never any symptoms. In the 1970s, tumors causing symptoms were discovered in 2 out of 100,000 people, while tumors discovered without causing symptoms occurred in 5.7 out of 100,000, for a total incidence of 7.7/100,000. With the advent of modern sophisticated imaging systems such as [[CT scans]], the discovery of asymptomatic meningiomas has tripled.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Meningiomas are more likely to appear in women than men, though when they appear in men, they are more likely to be malignant. Meningiomas may appear at any age, but most commonly are noticed in men and women age 50 or older, with meningiomas becoming more likely with age. They have been observed in all cultures, Western and Eastern, in roughly the same statistical frequency as other possible brain tumors.<ref name=Lee2008/>

==History==
The [[neoplasm]]s currently referred to as meningiomas were referred to with a wide range of names in older medical literature, depending on the source. Various descriptors included "fungoid tumors", "fungus of the dura mater", "epithelioma", "psammoma", "dural sarcoma", "dural endothelioma", "fibrosarcoma", "angioendothelioma", "arachnoidal fibroboastoma", "endotheliosis of the meninges", "meningeal fibroblastoma", "meningoblastoma", "mesothelioma of the meninges", "sarcoma of the dura", and others.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

The modern term of "meningioma" was used first by [[Harvey Cushing]] (1869–1939) in 1922, to describe a set of tumors that occur throughout the [[neuraxis]] (brain and spinal cord), but have various commonalities.<ref name="OkonkwoLaws2009">{{Cite book|vauthors =Okonkwo DO, Laws ER|year=2009|pages=3–10|doi=10.1007/978-1-84628-784-8_1|title =Meningiomas|isbn =978-1-84882-910-7|chapter =Meningiomas: Historical Perspective}}</ref><ref name="Prayson2009">{{Cite book|vauthors =Prayson RA|year=2009|pages=31–43|doi=10.1007/978-1-84628-784-8_5|title =Meningiomas|isbn =978-1-84882-910-7|chapter =Pathology of Meningiomas}}</ref> Charles Oberling then separated these into subtypes based on cell structure and, over the years, several other researchers have defined dozens of different subtypes as well. In 1979, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classified seven subtypes, upgraded in 2000 to a classification system with nine low-grade variants (grade I tumors) and three variants each of grade II and grade III meningiomas.<ref name="Prayson2009"/> The most common subtypes are Meningotheliomatous (63%), transitional or mixed-type (19%), fibrous (13%), and psammomatous (2%).<ref name=Lee2008/>

The earliest evidence of a probable meningioma is from a skull approximately 365,000 years old, which was found in Germany. Other probable examples have been discovered in other continents around the world, including North and South America, and Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The earliest written record of what was probably a meningioma is from the 1600s, when [[Felix Plater]] (1536–1614) of the [[University of Basel]] performed an autopsy on Sir Caspar Bonecurtius.<ref name="OkonkwoLaws2009"/> Surgery for removal of a meningioma was first attempted in the sixteenth century, but the first known successful surgery for removal of a meningioma of the convexity (parasagittal) was performed in 1770 by Anoine Luis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Louis A | year = 1774 | title = Mêmoire sur les Tumeurs Fungueuses de la Dure-mère | journal = Mem Acad Roy Chir | volume = 5 | pages = 1–59 }}</ref> The first documented successful removal of a skull base meningioma was performed in 1835 by Zanobi Pecchioli, Professor of Surgery at the  [[University of Siena]].<ref name=Lee2008/> Other notable meningioma researchers have been [[William Macewen]] (1848–1924), and [[William W. Keen]] (1837–1932).<ref name="OkonkwoLaws2009"/>

Improvements in meningioma research and treatment over the last century have occurred in terms of the surgical techniques for [[segmental resection|removal]] of the tumor, and related improvements in [[anesthesia]], [[antiseptic]] methods, techniques to control blood loss, better ability to determine which tumors are and are not operable,<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]]| isbn = 978-1-60406-053-9| vauthors = DeMonte F, Al-Mefty O, McDermott M | title = Al-Mefty's Meningiomata| edition=2nd|year = 2011}}</ref> and to effectively differentiate between the different meningioma subtypes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Kadi OS | title = A multiresolution clinical decision support system based on fractal model design for classification of histological brain tumours | journal = Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics | volume = 41 | pages = 67–79 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 24962336 | doi = 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2014.05.013 | arxiv = 1512.08051 | s2cid = 2518941 }}</ref>
