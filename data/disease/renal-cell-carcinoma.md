'''Renal cell carcinoma''' ('''RCC''') is a [[kidney cancer]] that originates in the lining of the [[Proximal tubule|proximal convoluted tubule]], a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90–95% of cases.<ref name=MSR>{{cite web |title= Renal Cell Carcinoma |website= Medscape Reference |publisher= WebMD |date= 26 February 2014 |access-date= 7 March 2014 |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281340-overview#showall |last1= Curti |first1= B |last2= Jana |first2= BRP |last3= Javeed |first3= M |last4= Makhoul |first4= I |last5= Sachdeva |first5= K |last6= Hu |first6= W |last7= Perry |first7= M |last8= Talavera |first8= F |editor= Harris, JE |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024450/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281340-overview#showall |archive-date= 7 March 2014}}</ref> It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1).<ref name=EAU2023>{{cite web |title=EAU Guidelines: Renal Cell Carcinoma – limited update March 2023 |url=https://d56bochluxqnz.cloudfront.net/documents/full-guideline/EAU-Guidelines-on-Renal-Cell-Carcinoma-2023.pdf |publisher=[[European Association of Urology]] |date=2023 |isbn=978-94-92671-19-6}}</ref> It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).<ref name=Znaor2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Znaor A, Lortet-Tieulent J, Laversanne M, Jemal A, Bray F |title=International variations and trends in renal cell carcinoma incidence and mortality |journal=European Urology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=519–30 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25449206 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2014.10.002 |url=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d5ea9c0113dd75a86a3257140a2f1b36332d1af3}}</ref>

RCC is also associated with a number of [[paraneoplastic syndromes]] (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body's attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC.<ref name="MSR" /> These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer.<ref name="MSR" /> The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: [[hypercalcaemia|high blood calcium levels]], [[polycythaemia|high red blood cell count]], [[thrombocytosis|high platelet count]] and secondary [[amyloidosis]].<ref name = MM/>
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings. This classic triad<ref name="cohen" /> is 1: [[haematuria]], which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10–15% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage.<ref name="cohen" /> Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments.<ref name="motzer" />

Other signs and symptom may include [[haematuria]];<ref name="cohen" /> loin pain;<ref name="cohen" /> abdominal mass;<ref name="motzer" /> [[malaise]], which is a general feeling of unwellness;<ref name="motzer" /> weight loss and/or loss of appetite;<ref name="kim" /> [[anaemia]] resulting from depression of [[erythropoietin]];<ref name="cohen" /> [[erythrocytosis]] (increased production of [[red blood cell]]s) due to increased erythropoietin secretion;<ref name="cohen" /> [[varicocele]], which is seen in males as an enlargement of the pampiniform plexus of veins draining the testis (more often the left testis)<ref name="motzer" /> [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) resulting from secretion of [[renin]] by the tumour;<ref name="Birkhauser2013" /> [[hypercalcemia]], which is elevation of calcium levels in the blood;<ref name="LaneBook" /> sleep disturbance or night sweats;<ref name="kim" /> recurrent [[fever]]s;<ref name="kim" /> and chronic fatigue.<ref name="metz" />

== Risk factors ==

=== Lifestyle ===
The greatest risk factors for RCC are lifestyle-related; smoking, obesity and [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) have been estimated to account for up to 50% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0057475|title=Metabolic Factors Associated with Risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma|year=2013|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Todd W|last1=Häggström|first1=Christel|last2=Rapp|first2=Kilian|last3=Stocks|first3=Tanja|last4=Manjer|first4=Jonas|last5=Bjørge|first5=Tone|last6=Ulmer|first6=Hanno|last7=Engeland|first7=Anders|last8=Almqvist|first8=Martin|last9=Concin|first9=Hans|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e57475|pmid=23468995|pmc=3585341|last10=Selmer|first10=R|last11=Ljungberg|first11=B|last12=Tretli|first12=S|last13=Nagel|first13=G|last14=Hallmans|first14=G|last15=Jonsson|first15=H|last16=Stattin|first16=P|bibcode=2013PLoSO...857475H|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Another suspected risk factor is the long term use of [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDS).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.356|title=Prospective Evaluation of Analgesic Use and Risk of Renal Cell Cancer|year=2011|last1=Cho|first1=Eunyoung|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=171|issue=16|pages=1487–93|pmid=21911634|last2=Curhan|first2=G|last3=Hankinson|first3=SE|last4=Kantoff|first4=P|last5=Atkins|first5=MB|last6=Stampfer|first6=M|last7=Choueiri|first7=TK|pmc=3691864}}</ref>

=== Genetics ===
Hereditary factors have a minor impact on individual susceptibility with immediate relatives of people with RCC having a two to fourfold increased risk of developing the condition.<ref name="Lipworth2009" /> Other genetically linked conditions also increase the risk of RCC, including [[hereditary papillary renal carcinoma]], hereditary [[leiomyomatosis]], [[Birt–Hogg–Dube syndrome]], [[hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome]], familial [[papillary thyroid carcinoma]], [[von Hippel–Lindau disease]]<ref name="Pavlovich2004" /> and [[sickle cell disease]].<ref name="rini" />

The most significant disease affecting risk however is not genetically linked – patients with acquired [[cyst]]ic disease of the kidney requiring dialysis are 30 times more likely than the general population to develop RCC.<ref name="Baldewijns2008" />

== Pathophysiology ==
The tumour arises from the cells of the [[proximal renal tubule|proximal renal tubular]] epithelium.<ref name = MSR/> It is considered an [[adenocarcinoma]].<ref name=MM>{{cite web|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma|website=Merck Manual Professional|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.|date=November 2013|access-date=7 March 2014|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary_disorders/genitourinary_cancer/renal_cell_carcinoma.html|author=Master, VA|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307051746/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary_disorders/genitourinary_cancer/renal_cell_carcinoma.html|archive-date=7 March 2014}}</ref> There are two subtypes: sporadic (that is, non-hereditary) and hereditary.<ref name = MSR/> Both such subtypes are associated with mutations in the short-arm of [[chromosome 3]], with the implicated genes being either tumour suppressor genes ([[Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor|VHL]] and [[tuberous sclerosis protein|TSC]]) or oncogenes (like [[c-Met]]).<ref name = MSR/>

== Diagnosis ==

The first steps taken to diagnose this condition are consideration of the signs and symptoms, and a [[medical history]] (the detailed medical review of past health state) to evaluate any risk factors. Based on the symptoms presented, a range of [[biochemical]] tests (using blood and/or urine samples) may also be considered as part of the screening process to provide sufficient quantitative analysis of any differences in [[electrolytes]], kidney and liver function, and blood clotting times.<ref name="rini" /> Upon physical examination, palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or an organ enlargement.<ref name=Tjaden>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1015-9584(11)60019-5 |title=Reactive Hypertrophy of an Accessory Spleen Mimicking Tumour Recurrence of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2011 |last1=Tjaden |first1=Christin |last2=Werner |first2=Jens |last3=Buechler |first3=Markus W. |last4=Hackert |first4=Thilo |journal=Asian Journal of Surgery |volume=34 |pages=50–2 |pmid=21515214 |issue=1|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Although this disease lacks characterization in the early stages of tumor development, considerations based on diverse clinical manifestations, as well as resistance to [[radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]] are important. The main diagnostic tools for detecting renal cell carcinoma are [[ultrasound]], [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanning and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the kidneys.<ref name=agabegi2nd>{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth D Agabegi |author2=Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-7153-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stepuptomedicine0000agab }}</ref>

=== Classification ===
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not a single entity, but rather a collection of different types of [[Tumor|tumours]], each derived from the various parts of the [[nephron]] ([[epithelium]] or [[Renal tubules#Renal tubule|renal tubules]]) and possessing distinct genetic characteristics, [[Histology|histological]] features, and, to some extent, clinical phenotypes.<ref name="rini" />

The 2004 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classification of genitourinary tumours recognizes over 40 subtypes of [[Kidney cancer|renal neoplasms]].

=== Laboratory tests ===
Laboratory tests are generally conducted when the patient presents with signs and symptoms that may be characteristic of kidney impairment. They are not primarily used to diagnose kidney cancer, due to its [[asymptomatic]] nature and are generally found incidentally during tests for other illnesses such as [[gallbladder]] disease.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Laura S.|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma|journal=Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing|date=30 November 2009|volume=13|pages=3–7|doi=10.1188/09.CJON.S2.3-7|pmid=19948453}}</ref>  In other words, these cancers are not detected usually because they do not cause pain or discomfort when they are discovered. Laboratory analysis can provide an assessment on the overall health of the patient and can provide information in determining the staging and degree of [[metastasis]] to other parts of the body (if a renal [[lesion]] has been identified) before treatment is given.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==== Urine analysis ====
The presence of blood in urine is a common presumptive sign of renal cell carcinoma. The [[haemoglobin]] of the blood causes the urine to be rusty, brown or red in colour. Alternatively, [[urinalysis]] can test for [[sugar]], [[protein]] and [[bacteria]] which can also serve as indicators for [[cancer]]. A complete blood cell count can also provide additional information regarding the severity and spreading of the cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonn|first=Dorothy|title=Urine test for renal-cell carcinoma|journal=The Lancet Oncology|date=31 Jan 2004|volume=5|issue=2|pages=72|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(04)01368-3|pmid=14974475}}</ref>

==== Complete blood cell count ====
The CBC provides a quantified measure of the different cells in the whole blood sample from the patient. Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]), white blood cells ([[leukocytes]]) and [[platelets]] ([[thrombocytes]]). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is [[anaemia]] whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells.<ref name=Johann>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac902204k |title=Combined Blood/Tissue Analysis for Cancer Biomarker Discovery: Application to Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2010 |last1=Johann |first1=Donald J. |last2=Wei |first2=Bih-Rong |last3=Prieto |first3=Darue A. |last4=Chan |first4=King C. |last5=Ye |first5=Xiaying |last6=Valera |first6=Vladimir A. |last7=Simpson |first7=R.

Inconsistencies with platelet counts are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), prothrombin time (PT), [[activated partial thromboplastin time]] (APTT) should be considered.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==== Blood chemistry ====
Blood chemistry tests are conducted if renal cell carcinoma is suspected as [[cancer]] has the potential to elevate levels of particular chemicals in blood. For example, liver [[enzymes]] such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST) and [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) are found to be at abnormally high levels.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00495.x |title=A multi-institution analysis of outcomes of liver-directed surgery for metastatic renal cell cancer |year=2012 |last1=Hatzaras |first1=Ioannis |last2=Gleisner |first2=Ana L. |last3=Pulitano |first3=Carlo |last4=Sandroussi |first4=Charbel |last5=Hirose |first5=Kenzo |last6=Hyder |first6=Omar |last7=Wolfgang |first7=Christopher L. |last8=Aldrighetti |first8=Luca |last9=Crawford |first9=Michael |last10=Choti |first10=Michael A. |last11=Pawlik |first11=Timothy M. |journal=HPB |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=532–8 |pmid=22762401 |pmc=3406350}}</ref> The staging of the cancer can also be determined by abnormal elevated levels of calcium, which suggests that the cancer may have metastasised to the bones.<ref name="Motzer2003">{{cite journal|last=Motzer|first=RJ|title=Renal cell carcinoma: a priority malignancy for development and study of novel therapies|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=Apr 1, 2003|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1193–4|pmid=12663704|doi=10.1200/JCO.2003.12.072}}</ref> In this case, a doctor should be prompted for a CT scan. Blood chemistry tests also assess the overall function of the kidneys and can allow the doctor to decide upon further radiological tests.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

=== Radiology ===
The characteristic appearance of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a solid renal lesion which disturbs the renal contour. It will frequently have an irregular or lobulated margin and may be seen as a lump on the lower pelvic or abdomen region. Traditionally, 85 to 90% of solid renal masses will turn out to be RCC but cystic renal masses may also be due to RCC.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sahni|first=V.A.|title=REVIEW: Biopsy of renal masses: when and why|journal=Cancer Imaging|date=1 January 2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=44–55|doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2009.0005|pmid=19602467|pmc=2739685}}</ref> However, the advances of diagnostic modalities are able to incidentally diagnose a great proportion of patients with renal lesions that may appear to be small in size and of benign state. Ten percent of RCC will contain [[calcification]]s, and some contain [[macroscopic]] fat (likely due to invasion and encasement of the perirenal fat).<ref name=Nakada>{{cite journal |pmid=6675440 |year=1983 |last1=Nakada |first1=G |last2=Machida |first2=T |last3=Masuda |first3=F |last4=Onishi |first4=T |last5=Yamazaki |first5=H |last6=Kiyota |first6=H |last7=Suzuki |first7=M |last8=Goto |first8=H |title=A case of arteriovenous fistulae secondary to renal cell carcinoma accompanied by congestive heart failure |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=901–5 |journal=Hinyokika Kiyo. Acta Urologica Japonica}}</ref>

Deciding on the [[benign]] or [[malignant]] nature of the renal mass on the basis of its localized size is an issue as renal cell carcinoma may also be cystic. As there are several benign cystic renal lesions (simple renal cyst, [[hemorrhage|haemorrhagic]] renal cyst, [[multilocular cystic nephroma]], [[polycystic kidney disease]]), it may occasionally be difficult for the radiologist to differentiate a benign cystic lesion from a malignant one.<ref name="Pattamapaspong">{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-0031-1293492 |title=Tuberculosis Arthritis and Tenosynovitis |year=2011 |last1=Pattamapaspong |first1=Nuttaya |last2=Muttarak |first2=Malai |last3=Sivasomboon |first3=Chate |journal=Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=459–69 |pmid=22081281|s2cid=260321430 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  The Bosniak classification system for cystic renal [[lesions]] classifies them into groups that are benign and those that need [[surgical resection]], based on specific imaging features.<ref name="Israel">{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiol.2362040218 |title=How I Do It: Evaluating Renal Masses1 |year=2005 |last1=Israel |first1=Gary M. |last2=Bosniak |first2=Morton A. |journal=Radiology |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=441–50 |pmid=16040900|s2cid=1916092 }}</ref>

The main imaging tests performed in order to identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography.<ref name=Jubelirer>{{cite journal |pmid=8421912 |year=1993 |last1=Jubelirer |first1=SJ |last2=Rubin |first2=M |title=The use of modern radiologic methods in identifying incidental renal cell carcinoma |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=21–3 |journal=The West Virginia Medical Journal}}</ref> Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory [[urography]], [[positron-emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, [[ultrasonography]], [[arteriography]], [[venography]], and bone scanning can also be used to aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==== Computed tomography ====
Contrast-enhanced [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanning is routinely used to determine the stage of the renal cell carcinoma in the [[abdominal]] and [[pelvic]] regions. CT scans have the potential to distinguish solid masses from cystic masses and may provide information on the localization, stage or spread of the cancer to other organs of the patient. Key parts of the human body which are examined for [[metastatic]] involvement of renal cell carcinoma may include the [[renal vein]], [[lymph node]] and the involvement of the [[inferior vena cava]].<ref name=Beck>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=AD|title=Renal cell carcinoma involving the inferior vena cava: radiologic evaluation and surgical management|journal=The Journal of Urology|date=Oct 1997|volume=118|issue=4|pages=533–7|pmid=916043|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(17)58098-2}}</ref>  According to a study conducted by Sauk et al., multidetector CT imaging characteristics have applications in diagnosing patients with clear renal cell carcinoma by depicting the differences of these cells at the cytogenic level.<ref name=Sauk>{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiol.11101508 |title=Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Multiphasic Multidetector CT Imaging Features Help Predict Genetic Karyotypes |year=2011 |last1=Sauk |first1=Steven C. |last2=Hsu |first2=Margaret S. |last3=Margolis |first3=Daniel J.

==== Ultrasound ====
Ultrasonographic examination can be useful in evaluating questionable [[asymptomatic]] kidney [[tumours]] and cystic renal [[lesions]] if [[computed tomography]] imaging is inconclusive. This safe and non-invasive radiologic procedure uses high frequency sound waves to generate an interior image of the body on a computer monitor. The image generated by the [[ultrasound]] can help diagnose renal cell carcinoma based on the differences of sound reflections on the surface of organs and the abnormal tissue masses. Essentially, ultrasound tests can determine whether the composition of the kidney mass is mainly solid or filled with fluid.<ref name="Jubelirer" />

A [[percutaneous biopsy]] can be performed by a radiologist using ultrasound or computed tomography to guide sampling of the tumour for the purpose of diagnosis by [[pathology]]. However this is not routinely performed because when the typical imaging features of renal cell carcinoma are present, the possibility of an incorrectly negative result together with the risk of a medical complication to the patient may make it unfavourable from a risk-benefit perspective.<ref name=Lane>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2007.08.124 |title=Renal Mass Biopsy—A Renaissance? |year=2008 |last1=Lane |first1=Brian R. |last2=Samplaski |first2=Mary K. |last3=Herts |first3=Brian R. |last4=Zhou |first4=Ming |last5=Novick |first5=Andrew C. |last6=Campbell |first6=Steven C. |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=179 |pages=20–7 |pmid=17997455 |issue=1}}</ref>  However, biopsy tests for molecular analysis to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumours is of investigative interest.<ref name="Lane" />

==== Magnetic resonance imaging ====
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans provide an image of the soft tissues in the body using radio waves and strong magnets. MRI can be used instead of CT if the patient exhibits an allergy to the contrast media administered for the test.<ref name=Hricak>{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiology.154.3.3969475 |pmid=3969475 |year=1985 |last1=Hricak |first1=H |last2=Demas |first2=BE |last3=Williams |first3=RD |last4=McNamara |first4=MT |last5=Hedgcock |first5=MW |last6=Amparo |first6=EG |last7=Tanagho |first7=EA |title=Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and staging of renal and perirenal neoplasms |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=709–15 |journal=Radiology}}</ref><ref name=Janus>{{cite journal |pmid=1863349 |year=1991 |last1=Janus |first1=CL |last2=Mendelson |first2=DS |title=Comparison of MRI and CT for study of renal and perirenal masses |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=69–118 |journal=Critical Reviews in Diagnostic Imaging}}</ref> Sometimes prior to the MRI scan, an [[intravenous]] injection of a contrasting material called [[gadolinium]] is given to allow for a more detailed image. Patients on dialysis or those who have renal insufficiency should avoid this contrasting material as it may induce a rare, yet severe, side effect known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.<ref name=Nishimura>{{cite journal |hdl=2433/119684 |pmid=3195400 |year=1988 |last1=Nishimura |first1=Kazuo |last2=Hida |first2=Shuichi |last3=Okada |first3=Kenichiro |last4=Yoshida |first4=Osamu |last5=Nishimuara |first5=Kazumasa |title=Staging and differential diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma: A comparison of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1323–31 |journal=Acta Urologica Japonica}}</ref>  A bone scan or brain imaging is not routinely performed unless signs or symptoms suggest potential metastatic involvement of these areas.
MRI scans should also be considered to evaluate [[tumor|tumour]] extension which has grown in major blood vessels, including the [[vena cava]], in the abdomen. MRI can be used to observe the possible spread of cancer to the [[brain]] or [[spinal cord]] should the patient present symptoms that suggest this might be the case.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==== Intravenous pyelogram ====
[[Intravenous pyelogram]] (IVP) is a useful procedure in detecting the presence of abnormal renal mass in the [[urinary tract]]. This procedure involves the injection of a contrasting dye into the arm of the patient. The dye travels from the blood stream and into the kidneys which in time, passes into the kidneys and bladder. This test is not necessary if a CT or MRI scan has been conducted.<ref name=Reznek>{{cite journal|last=Reznek|first=RH|title=CT/MRI in staging renal cell carcinoma|journal=Cancer Imaging|date=Feb 14, 2004|volume=4 Spec No A|pages=S25–32|pmid=18215972|doi=10.1102/1470-7330.2004.0012|pmc=1435344|issue=Spec No A}}</ref>

==== Renal angiography ====
Renal [[angiography]] uses the same principle as IVP, as this type of [[X-ray]] also uses a contrasting dye. This radiologic test is important in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma as an aid for examining [[blood vessels]] in the kidneys. This diagnostic test relies on the contrasting agent which is injected in the renal artery to be absorbed by the cancerous cells.<ref name=Kocak>{{cite journal |doi=10.2214/ajr.177.3.1770659 |title=Using MR Angiography for Surgical Planning in Pelvic Kidney Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2001 |last1=Kocak |first1=Mehmet |last2=Sudakoff |first2=Gary S. |last3=Erickson |first3=Scott |last4=Begun |first4=Frank |last5=Datta |first5=Milton |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=659–60 |pmid=11517066}}</ref> The contrasting dye provides a clearer outline of abnormally-oriented blood vessels believed to be involved with the tumour.  This is imperative for surgeons as it allows the patient's blood vessels to be mapped prior to operation.<ref name="Beck" />

=== Staging ===
The [[Cancer staging|staging]] of renal cell carcinoma is the most important factor in predicting its prognosis.<ref name=cornellurology>[http://www.cornellurology.com/kidney/gi/rcc.shtml Kidney Cancer / General Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101172045/http://www.cornellurology.com/kidney/gi/rcc.shtml |date=2011-11-01 }} at Weill Cornell Medical College, James Buchanan Brady Foundation, Department of Urology</ref> Staging can follow the [[TNM staging system]], where the size and extent of the tumour (T), involvement of lymph nodes (N) and metastases (M) are classified separately.

At diagnosis, 30% of renal cell carcinomas have spread to the ipsilateral renal vein, and 5–10% have continued into the inferior vena cava.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2214/ajr.171.6.9843299 |title=Inferior vena cava tumor thrombus in renal cell carcinoma: Staging by MR imaging and impact on surgical treatment |year=1998 |last1=Oto |first1=A |last2=Herts |first2=B R |last3=Remer |first3=E M |last4=Novick |first4=A C |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=171 |issue=6 |pages=1619–24 |pmid=9843299}}</ref>

The gross and microscopic appearance of renal cell carcinomas is highly variable. The renal cell carcinoma may present reddened areas where [[blood vessels]] have bled, and cysts containing watery fluids.<ref name="Brit">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497921/renal-carcinoma |title=Clear-cell Carcinoma, Hypernephroid Tumour, or Hypernephroma |access-date=2010-03-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507015655/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497921/renal-carcinoma |archive-date=2010-05-07 }}</ref> The body of the tumour shows large blood vessels that have walls composed of cancerous cells.
[[Gross examination]] often shows a yellowish, multilobulated tumor in the [[renal cortex]], which frequently contains zones of [[necrosis]], [[hemorrhage|haemorrhage]] and [[scarring]]. In a microscopic context, there are four major histologic subtypes of renal cell cancer: clear cell (conventional RCC, 75%), papillary (15%), chromophobic (5%), and collecting duct (2%). Sarcomatoid changes (morphology and patterns of IHC that mimic sarcoma, spindle cells) can be observed within any RCC subtype and are associated with more aggressive clinical course and worse prognosis.  Under light microscopy, these [[tumour]] cells can exhibit [[papilla (disambiguation)|papillae]], tubules or nests, and are quite large, atypical, and polygonal.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Recent studies have brought attention to the close association of the type of cancerous cells to the aggressiveness of the condition. Some studies suggest that these cancerous cells accumulate glycogen and lipids, their cytoplasm appear "clear", the nuclei remain in the middle of the cells, and the cellular membrane is evident.<ref name=Vasileva>{{cite journal |pmid=1016084 |year=1976 |last1=Vasil'Eva |first1=NN |last2=Koriakina |first2=RF |title=Morphological diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.

The most common cell type exhibited by renal cell carcinoma is the [[Clear cell renal cell carcinoma|clear cell]], which is named by the dissolving of the cells' high lipid content in the cytoplasm. The clear cells are thought to be the least likely to spread and usually respond more favourably to treatment. However, most of the tumours contain a mixture of cells. The most aggressive stage of renal cancer is believed to be the one in which the tumour is mixed, containing both clear and granular cells.<ref name=Lopez>{{cite journal|last=López|first=JI|title=Renal tumors with clear cells.

The recommended histologic grading schema for RCC is the Fuhrman system (1982), which is an assessment based on the microscopic morphology of a [[neoplasm]] with [[haematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (H&E staining). This system categorises renal cell carcinoma with grades 1, 2, 3, 4 based on nuclear characteristics.

Nuclear grade is believed to be one of the most imperative prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="rini" /> However, a study by [[Brett Delahunt|Delahunt]] et al. (2007) has shown that the Fuhrman grading is ideal for clear cell carcinoma but may not be appropriate for chromophobe renal cell carcinomas and that the staging of cancer (accomplished by CT scan) is a more favourable predictor of the prognosis of this disease.<ref name="Delahunt">{{cite journal |last1=Delahunt |first1=Brett |last2=Sika-Paotonu |first2=Dianne |author-link2=Dianne Sika-Paotonu |last3=Bethwaite |first3=Peter B. |last4=McCredie |first4=Margaret R.

==Prevention==
The risk of renal cell carcinoma can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lauby-Secretan|first1=B|last2=Scoccianti|first2=C|last3=Loomis|first3=D|last4=Grosse|first4=Y|last5=Bianchini|first5=F|last6=Straif|first6=K|last7=International Agency for Research on Cancer Handbook Working|first7=Group|title=Body Fatness and Cancer—Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=25 August 2016|volume=375|issue=8|pages=794–798|pmid=27557308|pmc=6754861|doi=10.1056/nejmsr1606602|url=https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/81847828-6457-4530-99ed-7b3c639705fb}}</ref>

== Management ==
[[Image:Embolization kidney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Micrograph]] of embolic material in a kidney removed because of renal cell carcinoma (cancer not shown). H&E stain.]]
The type of treatment depends on multiple factors and the individual, some of which include the stage of renal cell carcinoma (organs and parts of the body affected/unaffected), type of renal cell carcinoma, pre-existing or comorbid conditions and overall health and age of the person.<ref name=cohen /><ref name="simmons">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management|publisher=Humana Pr Inc.|isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=105–118|author=Simmons|author2=Campbell|chapter=Assessment of Oncologic Risk for Clinical Stage T1 Renal Tumours|date=2012-09-26}}</ref>
Every form of treatment has both risks and benefits; a health care professional will provide the best options that suit the individual circumstances.

If it has spread outside of the kidneys, often into the [[lymph nodes]], the [[lung]]s or the main vein of the kidney, then multiple therapies are used including surgery and medications. RCC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in most cases but does respond well to immunotherapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha, biologic, or targeted therapy. In early-stage cases, cryotherapy and surgery are the preferred options.

=== Active surveillance ===
Active surveillance or "watchful waiting" is becoming more common as small renal masses or tumours are being detected and also within the older generation when surgery is not always suitable.<ref name="smaldone" /> Active surveillance involves completing various diagnostic procedures, tests and imaging to monitor the progression of the RCC before embarking on a more high risk treatment option like surgery.<ref name="smaldone">{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-062-5_10 |chapter=Active Surveillance of the Small Renal Mass |title=Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2013 |last1=Smaldone |first1=Marc C. |last2=Canter |first2=Daniel |last3=Kutikov |first3=Alexander |last4=Uzzo |first4=Robert G. |isbn=978-1-62703-061-8 |pages=167–94}}</ref> In the elderly, patients with co-morbidities, and in poor surgical candidates, this is especially useful.

=== Surgery ===
Different procedures may be most appropriate, depending on circumstances.

The recommended treatment for renal cell cancer may be [[nephrectomy]] or [[nephrectomy#partial nephrectomy|partial nephrectomy]], surgical removal of all or part of the kidney.<ref name="r"/> This may include some of the surrounding organs or tissues or lymph nodes. If cancer is only in the kidneys, which is about 60% of cases, it can be cured roughly 90% of the time with [[surgery]].

Small renal tumors (< 4&nbsp;cm) are treated increasingly by partial nephrectomy when possible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Novick AC |title=Nephron-sparing surgery for renal cell carcinoma |journal=Br J Urol |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=321–4 |date=September 1998 |pmid=9772865 |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.1998.00751.x|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Herr HW |title=Partial nephrectomy for unilateral renal carcinoma and a normal contralateral kidney: 10-year followup |journal=J.

Surgical nephrectomy may be "radical" if the procedure removes the entire affected kidney including [[Renal fascia|Gerota's fascia]], the [[adrenal gland]] which is on the same side as the affected kidney, and the regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes, all at the same time.<ref name="cohen" /> This method, although severe, is effective. But it is not always appropriate, as it is a major surgery that contains the risk of complication both during and after the surgery and can have a longer recovery time.<ref name="casey">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.surge.2013.02.007 |title=Renal cell carcinoma with IVC and atrial thrombus: A single centre's 10 year surgical experience |year=2013 |last1=Casey |first1=R.G. |last2=Raheem |first2=O.A. |last3=Elmusharaf |first3=E. |last4=Madhavan |first4=P. |last5=Tolan |first5=M. |last6=Lynch |first6=T.H. |journal=The Surgeon |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=295–9 |pmid=23510704}}</ref>  It is important to note that the other kidney must be fully functional, and this technique is most often used when there is a large tumour present in only one kidney.

[[File:Large left renal tumor with tumor thrombus all the way to the heart.jpg|thumb|Left renal tumor with inferior vena cava thrombus into the right atrium]]
In cases where the tumor has spread into the renal vein, inferior vena cava, and possibly the right atrium, this portion of the tumor can be surgically removed, as well. When the tumor involved the inferior vena cava, it is important to classify which parts of the vena cava are involved and to plan accordingly, as sometimes complete resection will involve an incision into the chest with increased morbidity. For this reason, Dr. [[Gaetano Ciancio]] adapted liver mobilization techniques from liver transplant to address retrohepatic or even suprahepatic inferior vena caval thrombus associated with renal tumors.<ref name="Ciancio Livingstone Soloway 2007 pp. 988–995">{{cite journal | last1=Ciancio | first1=Gaetano | last2=Livingstone | first2=Alan S. | last3=Soloway | first3=Mark | title=Surgical Management of Renal Cell Carcinoma with Tumor Thrombus in the Renal and Inferior Vena Cava: The University of Miami Experience in Using Liver Transplantation Techniques | journal=European Urology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=51 | issue=4 | year=2007 | issn=0302-2838 | doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2006.11.055 | pages=988–995| pmid=17175095 }}</ref> With this technique, the whole abdominal [[inferior vena cava]] is able to be mobilized.

[[Laparoscopic surgery|Surgery]] is increasingly performed via [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] techniques.  Commonly referred to as key hole surgery, this surgery does not have the large incisions seen in a classically performed radical or partial nephrectomy, but still successfully removes either all or part of the kidney. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in the hospital and quicker recovery time but there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure. These have the advantage of being less of a burden for the patient and the disease-free survival is comparable to that of open surgery.<ref name="r"/>  For small exophytic lesions that do not extensively involve the major vessels or urinary collecting system, a [[nephrectomy#partial nephrectomy|partial nephrectomy]] (also referred to as "nephron sparing surgery") can be performed. This may involve temporarily stopping blood flow to the kidney while the mass is removed as well as renal cooling with an ice slush. [[Mannitol]] can also be administered to help limit damage to the kidney.  This is usually done through an open incision although smaller lesions can be done laparoscopically with or without robotic assistance.

Laparoscopic [[cryotherapy]] can also be done on smaller lesions.  Typically a biopsy is taken at the time of treatment. Intraoperative ultrasound may be used to help guide placement of the freezing probes. Two freeze/thaw cycles are then performed to kill the tumor cells.  As the tumor is not removed followup is more complicated (see below) and overall disease-free rates are not as good as those obtained with surgical removal.

'''Surgery for metastatic disease:''' If metastatic disease is present surgical treatment may still a viable option. Radical and partial nephrectomy can still occur, and in some cases, if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed.<ref name=cohen /> This depends on what stage of growth and how far the disease has spread.

=== Percutaneous ablative therapies ===
[[Percutaneous]] [[ablation]] therapies use image-guidance by [[radiologists]] to treat localized tumors if a surgical procedure is not a good option.  Although the use of laparoscopic surgical techniques for complete nephrectomies has reduced some of the risks associated with surgery,<ref name="Russo2013" /> surgery of any sort in some cases will still not be feasible. For example, the elderly, people who already have severe renal dysfunction, or people who have several [[comorbidities]], surgery of any sort is not warranted.<ref name="Matin2013" />

A probe is placed through the skin and into the tumor using real-time imaging of both the probe tip and the tumor by [[computed tomography]], [[ultrasound]], or even [[magnetic resonance imaging]] guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat ([[radiofrequency ablation]]) or cold ([[cryotherapy]]). These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mogami T, Harada J, Kishimoto K, Sumida S |title=Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation for malignancies, with a focus on renal cell carcinoma |journal=Int. J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=79–84 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17443274 |doi=10.1007/s10147-006-0654-6|s2cid=5743758 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boss A, Clasen S, Kuczyk M, Schick F, Pereira PL |title=Image-guided radiofrequency ablation of renal cell carcinoma |journal=Eur Radiol |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=725–33 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17021704 |doi=10.1007/s00330-006-0415-y|s2cid=12651841 }}</ref> Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5&nbsp;cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation can be used on tumors that are larger.<ref name="Matin2013" />

The two main types of ablation techniques that are used for renal cell carcinoma are [[radio frequency ablation]] and [[cryoablation]].<ref name="Matin2013" />

'''Radio frequency ablation'''  uses an electrode [[wikt:probe|probe]] which is inserted into the affected tissue, to send radio frequencies to the tissue to generate heat through the friction of water molecules. The heat destroys the tumor tissue.<ref name="cohen" />  Cell death will generally occur within minutes of being exposed to temperatures above 50&nbsp;°C.

'''Cryoablation''' also involves the insertion of a probe into the affected area,<ref name="cohen" /> however, cold is used to kill the tumor instead of heat. The probe is cooled with chemical fluids which are very cold. The freezing temperatures cause the tumor cells to die by causing [[osmotic dehydration]], which pulls the water out of the cell destroying the [[enzyme]], [[organelle]]s, [[cell membrane]] and freezing the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name="Matin2013" />

=== Targeted drugs ===
Cancers often grow in an unbridled fashion because they are able to evade the immune system.<ref name=":0"/> [[Immunomodulatory|Immunotherapy]] is a method that activates the person's immune system and uses it to their own advantage.<ref name=":0"/>  It was developed after observing that in some cases there was spontaneous regression.<ref name="davar">{{cite book|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Clinical Management|year=2013|publisher=Humana |isbn=978-1-62703-061-8|pages=279–302|author=Davar|author2=Fenton|author3=Appleman|chapter=Immunotherapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma}}</ref> Immunotherapy capitalises on this phenomenon and aims to build up a person's immune response to cancer cells.<ref name="davar" />

=== Chemotherapy ===
[[Chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] are not as successful in the case of RCC. RCC is resistant in most cases but there is about a 4–5% success rate, but this is often short-lived with more tumours and growths developing later.<ref name=cohen />

=== Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy ===
[[Adjuvant therapy]], which refers to therapy given after a primary surgery, had for a long time not been found to be beneficial in renal cell cancer.<ref name="nejm" />  However in 2021 [[Pembrolizumab]] was approved for adjuvant treatment after showing promising disease-free survival improvements.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-pembrolizumab-adjuvant-treatment-renal-cell-carcinoma | title=FDA approves pembrolizumab for adjuvant treatment of renal cell carcinoma | journal=FDA | date=17 November 2021 }}</ref>

Conversely, [[neoadjuvant therapy]] is administered before the intended primary or main treatment. In some cases neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to decrease the size and stage of the RCC to then allow it to be surgically removed.<ref name="stroup" /> This is a new form of treatment and the effectiveness of this approach is still being assessed in [[clinical trial]]s.

== Metastasis ==
Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is the spread of the primary renal cell carcinoma from the kidney to other organs. Approximately 25–30% of people have this [[Metastasis|metastatic spread]] by the time they are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="DoisMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00345-004-0466-0|title=Novel approaches in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma|year=2005|last1=Lam|first1=John S.|last2=Leppert|first2=John T.|last3=Belldegrun|first3=Arie S.|last4=Figlin|first4=Robert A.|journal=World Journal of Urology|volume=23|issue=3|pages=202–12|pmid=15812574|s2cid=12091991}}</ref> This high proportion is explained by the fact that clinical signs are generally mild until the disease progresses to a more severe state.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2007.03.035|title=Renal Cell Carcinoma Guideline|year=2007|last1=Ljungberg|first1=Börje|last2=Hanbury|first2=Damian C.|last3=Kuczyk|first3=Marcus A.|last4=Merseburger|first4=Axel S.|last5=Mulders|first5=Peter F.A.|last6=Patard|first6=Jean-Jacques|last7=Sinescu|first7=Ioanel C.|journal=European Urology|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1502–10|pmid=17408850|author8=European Association of Urology Guideline Group for renal cell carcinoma}}</ref> The most common sites for metastasis are the lymph nodes, lung, bones, liver and brain.<ref name="motzer" /> How this spread affects the staging of the disease and hence prognosis is discussed in the "Diagnosis" and "Prognosis" sections.

MRCC has a poor prognosis compared to other cancers, although average survival times have increased in the last few years due to treatment advances. Average survival time in 2008 for the metastatic form of the disease was under a year,<ref name="DoictrvMissing" /> and by 2013 this improved to an average of 22 months.<ref name="DoiCADbeecMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283609ec1|pmid=23552469|title=Chemotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma today?

The available treatments for RCC discussed in the "Treatment" section are also relevant for the metastatic form of the disease. Options include interleukin-2, which is a standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="nejm" /> From 2007 to 2013, seven new treatments have been approved specifically for mRCC (sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, sorafenib, everolimus, pazopanib and axitinib).<ref name=singer /> These new treatments are based on the fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumours – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumours, hence slowing growth and in some cases, reducing the size of the tumours.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.06.010|title=What is the optimal therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who progress on an initial VEGFr-TKI?|year=2013|last1=Calvo|first1=Emiliano|last2=Ravaud|first2=Alain|last3=Bellmunt|first3=Joaquim|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=39|issue=4|pages=366–74|pmid=22832091}}</ref>
Side effects unfortunately are quite common with these treatments and include:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2012.12.006|title=A contemporary update on rates and management of toxicities of targeted therapies for metastatic renal cell carcinoma|year=2013|last1=Alasker|first1=Ahmed|last2=Meskawi|first2=Malek|last3=Sun|first3=Maxine|last4=Ismail|first4=Salima|last5=Hanna|first5=Nawar|last6=Hansen|first6=Jens|last7=Tian|first7=Zhe|last8=Bianchi|first8=Marco|last9=Perrotte|first9=Paul|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=39|issue=4|pages=388–401|pmid=23317510|last10=Karakiewicz|first10=Pierre I.}}</ref>
* Gastrointestinal effects – nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia
* Respiratory effects – coughing, dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
* Cardiovascular effects – hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Neurological effects – intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), thrombosis (blood clots) in the brain
* Effects on the skin and mucous membranes – rashes, [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|hand-foot syndrome]], stomatitis
* Bone marrow suppression – resulting in reduced white blood cells, increasing the risk of infections plus anemia and reduced platelets
* Renal effects – impaired kidney function
* Fatigue

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are more commonly used in the metastatic form of RCC to target the secondary tumours in the bones, liver, brain and other organs. While not curative, these treatments do provide relief for symptoms associated with the spread of tumours.<ref name="DoiCADbeecMissing" />

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including tumour size, degree of invasion and metastasis, histologic type, and nuclear grade.<ref name="rini"/> Staging is the most important factor in the outcome of renal cell cancer. The following numbers are based on patients first diagnosed in 2001 and 2002 by the National Cancer Data Base:<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003107-pdf.pdf/ Kidney Cancer (Adult) – Renal Cell Carcinoma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405223318/http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003107-pdf.pdf |date=2016-04-05 }}  American Cancer Society.

For instance, younger people (among 20–40 years old) have a better outcome despite having more symptoms at presentation, possibly due to lower rates spread of cancer to the lymph nodes (stage III).

Histological grade is related to the aggressiveness of the cancer, and it is classified in 4 grades, with 1 having the best prognosis (five-year survival over 89%), and 4 with the worst prognosis (46% of five-year survival).

Some people have the renal cell cancer detected before they have symptoms (incidentally) because of the [[CT scan]] (Computed Tomography Imaging) or [[ultrasound]]. Incidentally diagnosed renal cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of renal cell carcinoma or metastasis. The five-year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental renal cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic renal cell carcinoma.<ref name="pmid10647646">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsui KH, Shvarts O, Smith RB, Figlin R, de Kernion JB, Belldegrun A | title = Renal cell carcinoma: prognostic significance of incidentally detected tumors | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 163 | issue = 2 | pages = 426–30 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10647646 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5347(05)67892-5}}</ref>

If it has metastasized to the lymph nodes, the five-year survival is around 5% to 15%.

Renal cell carcinoma is one of the cancers most strongly associated with [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s, most often due to ectopic hormone production by the tumour. The treatment for these complications of RCC is generally limited beyond treating the underlying cancer.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of the disease varies according to geographic, demographic and, to a lesser extent, hereditary factors. There are some known risk factors, however the significance of other potential risk factors remains more controversial. The incidence of the cancer has been increasing in frequency worldwide at a rate of approximately 2–3% per decade<ref name="DoictrvMissing">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2007.12.001|title=Epidemiologic and socioeconomic burden of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): A literature review|year=2008|last1=Gupta|first1=Kiran|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Li|first3=Jim Z.|last4=Russell|first4=Mason W.|last5=Charbonneau|first5=Claudie|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|volume=34|issue=3|pages=193–205|pmid=18313224}}</ref> until the last few years where the number of new cases has stabilised.<ref name="Ljungberg et al 2011">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.049|title=The Epidemiology of Renal Cell Carcinoma|year=2011|last1=Ljungberg|first1=Börje|last2=Campbell|first2=Steven C.|last3=Choi|first3=Han Yong|last4=Jacqmin|first4=Didier|last5=Lee|first5=Jung Eun|last6=Weikert|first6=Steffen|last7=Kiemeney|first7=Lambertus A.|journal=European Urology|volume=60|issue=4|pages=615–21|pmid=21741761}}</ref>

[[Daniel Sennert]] made the first reference suggesting a [[tumour]] arising in the [[kidney]] in his text ''Practicae Medicinae'', first published in 1613.<ref name=history>{{cite journal|last=Delahunt|first=Brett|title=History of Renal Neoplasia|journal=United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2009 Annual Meeting|date=March 8, 2009|url=http://www.uscap.org/site~/98th/pdf/companion09h02.pdf|access-date=April 27, 2013|archive-date=March 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329054018/http://www.uscap.org/site~/98th/pdf/companion09h02.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Miril published the earliest unequivocal case of renal [[carcinoma]] in 1810.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Delahunt|first=Brett|author2=Thornton A|title=Renal cell carcinoma.

Koenig published the first classification of renal tumours based on macroscopic morphology in 1826. Koenig divided the tumors into scirrhous, steatomatous, fungoid and medullary forms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cll.2005.01.007 |title=History of the Development of the Classification of Renal Cell Neoplasia |year=2005 |last1=Delahunt |first1=Brett |last2=Eble |first2=John N. |journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=231–46, v |pmid=15848734}}</ref>

=== Hypernephroma controversy ===

Following the classification of the tumour, researchers attempted to identify the tissue of origin for renal carcinoma.

The [[pathogenesis]] of renal epithelial tumours was debated for decades. The debate was initiated by [[Paul Grawitz]] when in 1883, he published his observations on the morphology of small, yellow renal [[tumors|tumours]]. Grawitz concluded that only alveolar tumours were of [[adrenal]] origin, whereas papillary tumours were derived from [[renal]] tissue.<ref name=history />

In 1893, Paul Sudeck challenged the theory postulated by Grawitz by publishing descriptions of renal tumours in which he identified atypical features within [[Renal tubules#Renal tubule|renal tubules]] and noted a gradation of these atypical features between the tubules and neighboring [[malignant tumour]]. In 1894, [[Otto Lubarsch]], who supported the theory postulated by Grawitz coined the term ''hypernephroid tumor'', which was amended to ''hypernephroma'' by [[Felix Victor Birch-Hirschfeld]] to describe these tumours.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.1929.00140050123011 |title=Carcinoma of the Renal Cortex with Factors Bearing on Prognosis |year=1929 |last1=Judd |first1=E. Starr |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=746}}</ref>

Vigorous criticism of Grawitz was provided by Oskar Stoerk in 1908, who considered the [[adrenal]] origin of renal tumours to be unproved. Despite the compelling arguments against the theory postulated by Grawitz, the term hypernephroma, with its associated adrenal connotation, persisted in the literature.<ref name=history />

Foot and Humphreys, and Foote et al. introduced the term ''Renal Celled Carcinoma'' to emphasize a [[Renal tubular#Renal tubule|renal tubular]] origin for these [[tumors|tumours]]. Their designation was slightly altered by Fetter to the now widely accepted term ''Renal Cell Carcinoma''.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14861941 |year=1951 |last1=Foot |first1=NC |last2=Humphreys |first2=GA |last3=Whitmore |first3=WF |title=Renal tumors: Pathology and prognosis in 295 cases |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=190–200 |journal=The Journal of Urology|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(17)74326-1 }}</ref>

Convincing evidence to settle the debate was offered by Oberling et al. in 1959 who studied the [[ultrastructure]] of clear cells from eight renal [[carcinomas]]. They found that the tumour cell [[cytoplasm]] contained numerous [[mitochondria]] and deposits of [[glycogen]] and fat. They identified [[cytoplasmic membrane]]s inserted perpendicularly onto the [[basement membrane]] with occasional cells containing [[microvilli]] along the free borders. They concluded that these features indicated that the tumours arose from the [[epithelial]] cells of the [[Renal tubule|renal convoluted tubule]], thus finally settling one of the most debated issues in [[tumour]] pathology.<ref name=history /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/186402a0 |title=Ultrastructure of the Clear Cells in Renal Carcinomas and its Importance for the Demonstration of their Renal Origin |year=1960 |last1=Oberling |first1=CH. |last2=Rivière |first2=M. |last3=Haguenau |first3=FR. |journal=Nature |volume=186 |issue=4722 |pages=402–403|pmid=14428164 |bibcode=1960Natur.186..402O |s2cid=4224899 }}</ref>
