'''Mites''' are small [[arachnid]]s (eight-legged [[arthropod]]s). Mites span two large orders of arachnids, the [[Acariformes]] and the [[Parasitiformes]], which were historically grouped together in the subclass '''Acari'''. However, most recent genetic analyses do not recover the two as each other's closest relative within Arachnida, rendering the group non-[[monophyletic]]. Most mites are tiny, less than {{convert|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in length, and have a simple, unsegmented body plan. The small size of most species makes them easily overlooked; some species live in water, many live in soil as [[decomposer]]s, others live on plants, sometimes creating [[gall]]s, while others are [[Predation|predators]] or [[Parasitism|parasites]]. This last type includes the commercially destructive ''[[Varroa]]'' parasite of [[honey bee]]s, as well as [[scabies]] mites of humans. Most species are harmless to humans, but a few are associated with allergies or may transmit diseases.

The scientific discipline devoted to the study of mites is called [[acarology]].

==Evolution and taxonomy==
[[File:Yellow mite (Tydeidae) Lorryia formosa 2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|The microscopic mite ''[[Lorryia formosa]]'' ([[Tydeidae]])]]

The mites are not a defined taxon, but is used for two distinct groups of arachnids, the [[Acariformes]] and the [[Parasitiformes]]. The [[phylogeny]] of the Acari has been relatively little studied, but molecular information from [[ribosomal DNA]] is being extensively used to understand relationships between groups. The 18 S rRNA gene provides information on relationships among [[Phylum|phyla]] and superphyla, while the [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS2]], and the [[18S ribosomal RNA]] and [[28S ribosomal RNA]] genes, provide clues at deeper levels.<ref name=Dhooria>{{cite book| vauthors = Dhooria MS | chapter = Molecular Biology and Acarology |title=Fundamentals of Applied Acarology | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ktS4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA176 |year=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-981-10-1594-6 |pages=176}}</ref>

==Anatomy==

===External===
Mites are tiny members of the class [[Arachnid]]a; most are in the size range {{convert|250|to|750|µm|in|2|abbr=on}} but some are larger and some are no bigger than {{convert|100|µm|in|3|abbr=on}} as adults. The body plan has two [[tagma (biology)|regions]], a [[cephalothorax]] (with no separate head) or prosoma, and an [[opisthosoma]] or abdomen. Segmentation has almost entirely been lost and the prosoma and opisthosoma are fused, only the positioning of the limbs indicating the location of the segments.<ref name=Ruppert/>

[[File:Acarine anatomy and morphology.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|1 Chelicerae, 2 Palps, 3 Salivary glands, 4 Gut, 5 Excretory (Malpighian) tubules, 6 Anus, 7 Ovary or testes, 8 Air-breathing tubes (tracheae), 9 Central ganglion, 10 Legs, 11 Hypostome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Balashov YS | year = 1972 | title = Bloodsucking Ticks - Vectors of Diseases of Man and Animals | journal = Miscellaneous Publications of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 8 | pages = 161–376 }}</ref>]]

At the front of the body is the [[gnathosoma]] or capitulum. This is not a head and does not contain the eyes or the brain, but is a retractable feeding apparatus consisting of the [[chelicerae]], the [[pedipalp]]s and the oral cavity. It is covered above by an extension of the body [[carapace]] and is connected to the body by a flexible section of [[cuticle]]. 
Two-segmented chelicerae is the ancestral condition in Acariformes, but in more derived groups they are single-segmented. And three-segmented chelicerae is the ancestral condition in Parasitiformes, but has been reduced to just two segments in more derived groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o2t2BgAAQBAJ&dq=Ancestrally+chelicera+two-segmented+Acariformes+Parasitiformes+three-segmented&pg=PA266 Parasite Diversity and Diversification]</ref> The pedipalps differ between taxa depending on diet; in some species the appendages resemble legs while in others they are modified into chelicerae-like structures. The oral cavity connects posteriorly to the mouth and [[pharynx]].<ref name=Ruppert/>

Most mites have four pairs of legs (two pairs in [[Eriophyoidea]]<ref>{{Citation | vauthors = Hoy MA |title=Four-Legged Mites (Eriophyoidea or Tetrapodili) |date=2004 |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/0-306-48380-7_1689 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Entomology |pages=913–919 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |language=en |doi=10.1007/0-306-48380-7_1689 |isbn=978-0-7923-8670-4 |access-date=2023-02-08}}</ref>), each with six segments, which may be modified for swimming or other purposes. The dorsal surface of the body is clad in hardened [[Tergum|tergites]] and the ventral surface by hardened [[sclerite]]s; sometimes these form transverse ridges. The [[gonopore]] (genital opening) is located on the ventral surface between the fourth pair of legs. Some species have one to five median or lateral eyes but many species are blind, and slit and pit sense organs are common. Both body and limbs bear [[seta]]e (bristles) which may be simple, flattened, club-shaped or sensory. Mites are usually some shade of brown, but some species are red, orange, black or green, or some combination of these colours.<ref name=Ruppert/>

Many mites have stigmata (openings used in respiration). In some mites, the stigmata are associated with peritremes: paired, tubular, elaborated extensions of the tracheal system. The higher taxa of mites are defined by these structures:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Glossary |url=https://idtools.org/bee_mite/index.cfm?pageID=14 |access-date=2023-06-26 |website=Bee Mite ID}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{Cite web |title=All mites have a small head |url=https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/mites/qmites/html/21_Peritremes.htm |access-date=2023-06-26 |website=keys.lucidcentral.org}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite book | vauthors = Krantz GW |title=A Manual of Acarology |date=2009 |publisher=Texas Tech University Press |isbn=978-0-89672-620-8 |edition=3rd |location=Lubbock, Tex |language=English |chapter=Form and Function | veditors = Krantz GW, Walter DE }}</ref>

* Prostigmata ([[wiktionary:pro-|pro-]] = before/in front) have stigmata at the front of the body, usually on the lateral margins or between the chelicerae. These are associated with peritremes that may be on the prodorsum near the cheliceral bases, or be horn-like and emergent, or form a line or network on the dorsum of the gnathosomal capsule.<ref name=":02" />

* The other three orders of Parasitiformes, Holothyrida, Ixodida, and Mesostigmata ([[wiktionary:meso-|meso-]] = middle), have just one pair of stigmata in the region of the fourth pair of legs. They also have peritremes: in Ixodida these consist of paired encircling plates around the stigmata, while the peritremes in Mesostigmata and Holothyrida are grooves extending from the stigmata anteriorly (sometimes also posteriorly).<ref name=":12" />

==Reproduction and life cycle==
[[File:Harvest mite cycle.svg|thumb|[[Harvest mite]] (Trombiculidae) life cycle: the larvae and nymphs resemble small adults, though the larvae have only six legs.]]

The sexes are separate in mites; males have a pair of [[Testicle|testes]] in the mid-region of the body, each connected to the gonopore by a [[vas deferens]], and in some species there is a chitinous [[penis]]; females have a single [[ovary]] connected to the gonopore by an [[oviduct]], as well as a [[Female sperm storage|seminal receptacle]] for the storage of [[sperm]]. In most mites, sperm is transferred to the female indirectly; the male either deposits a [[spermatophore]] on a surface from which it is picked up by the female, or he uses his chelicerae or third pair of legs to insert it into the female's gonopore. In some of the [[Acariformes]], insemination is direct using the male's penis.<ref name=Ruppert/> The spermatophora in all mites are aflagellate.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8049248_How_the_sperm_lost_its_tail_The_evolution_of_aflagellate_sperm How the sperm lost its tail: The evolution of aflagellate sperm]</ref>

The eggs are laid in the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], or wherever the mite happens to live. They take up to six weeks to hatch, according to species, with the next stage being the six-legged larvae. After three moults, the larvae become nymphs,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s40629-023-00249-6|vauthors=Uzbekov R, Bouakaz A, Postema M|journal=Allergo J Int|year=2023|title=Closeups of a not-so-domestic mite tritonymph|volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=337–339 |s2cid=258581966 |doi-access=free}}</ref> with eight legs, and after a further three moults, they become adults. Longevity varies between species, but the lifespan of mites is short compared to many other arachnids.<ref name=Ruppert/>

Mites occupy a wide range of [[ecological niches]]. For example, [[Oribatida]] mites are important [[decomposers]] in many habitats. They eat a wide variety of material including living and dead plant and fungal material, lichens and carrion; some are [[predation|predatory]], though no oribatid mites are [[parasitism|parasitic]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arroyo J, Keith AM, Schmidt O, Bolger T | year=2013 | title=Mite abundance and richness in an Irish survey of soil biodiversith with comments on some newly recorded species | journal= Irish Naturalists' Journal | volume=33 | pages=19–27 }}</ref> Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all [[invertebrate]] groups.

===Parasitism===

Many mites are [[parasitism|parasitic]] on plants and animals. One family of mites, [[Pyroglyphidae]], or nest mites, live primarily in the nests of birds and other animals. These mites are largely [[parasitism|parasitic]] and consume [[blood]], [[skin]] and [[keratin]]. [[Dust mites]], which feed mostly on dead skin and hair shed from humans instead of consuming them from the organism directly, evolved from these parasitic ancestors.<ref name="Klimov_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klimov PB, OConnor B | title = Is permanent parasitism reversible?--critical evidence from early evolution of house dust mites | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 411–423 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23417682 | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syt008 | doi-access = free }}

Parasitic mites sometimes infest insects. ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' attaches to the body of [[honey bee]]s, and ''[[Acarapis woodi]]'' (family [[Tarsonemidae]]) lives in their [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e. Hundreds of species are associated with other bees, mostly poorly described. They attach to bees in a variety of ways. For example, ''[[Trigona corvina]]'' workers have been found with mites attached to the outer face of their hind tibiae.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Stingless bees (Meliponidae) of the Western Hemisphere: Lestrimelitta and the following subgenera of Trigona: Trigona, Paratrigona, Schwarziana, Parapartamona, Cephalotrigona, Oxytrigona, Scaura, and Mourella. | journal = Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume = 90 |url= https://archive.org/details/bulletin-american-museum-natural-history-90-001-546| vauthors = Schwarz HF, Bacon AL |hdl=2246/1231|year=1948 }}</ref> Some are thought to be parasites, while others are beneficial [[symbiosis|symbionts]].

Plant pests include the so-called [[spider mite]]s (family [[Tetranychidae]]), [[thread-footed mite]]s (family [[Tarsonemidae]]), and the [[gall mite]]s (family [[Eriophyidae]]).<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Fenemore PG | chapter = Chapter 7: Mites and other non-insect pests |title=Plant Pests and Their Control|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKVmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA112 |year=2016 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4831-8286-5 |page=112}}</ref> Among the species that attack animals are members of the [[Mange#Sarcoptic mange|sarcoptic mange]] mites (family [[Sarcoptidae]]), which burrow under the skin.

===Dispersal===
Being unable to fly, mites need some other means of dispersal. On a small scale, walking is used to access other suitable locations in the immediate vicinity. Some species mount to a high point and adopt a dispersal posture and get carried away by the wind, while others waft a thread of silk aloft to balloon to a new position.<ref name=Capinera>{{cite book| vauthors = Ho CC | chapter = Mite Pests of Crops in Asia | veditors = Capinera JL |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA2425 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=2425}}</ref>

Parasitic mites use their hosts to disperse, and spread from host to host by direct contact. Another strategy is [[Phoresis (biology)|phoresy]]; the mite, often equipped with suitable claspers or suckers, grips onto an insect or other animal, and gets transported to another place. A phoretic mite is just a hitch-hiker and does not feed during the time it is carried by its temporary host. These travelling mites are mostly species that reproduce rapidly and are quick to colonise new habitats.<ref name=Capinera/>

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Stefania Lanza and her soft toy Scabies Mite.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Public health]] worker Stefania Lanzia using a [[scabies mite]] to publicise [[scabies]], an often overlooked condition especially among the elderly]]

Mites are tiny and apart from those that are of economic concern to humans, little studied. The majority are beneficial, living in the soil or aqueous environments and assisting in the decomposition of decaying organic material, as part of the [[carbon cycle]].<ref name=Jeppson/>

Two species live on humans, namely ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'' and ''[[Demodex brevis]]''; both are frequently referred to as eyelash mites.

===Medical significance===

The majority of mite species are harmless to humans and [[domestic animal]]s, but a few species can colonize mammals directly, acting as [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s for disease transmission, and causing or contributing to allergenic diseases.

===In beekeeping===

The mite ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' is a serious pest of [[honey bee]]s, contributing to [[colony collapse disorder]] in [[beekeeping|commercial hives]]. This organism is an obligate external parasite, able to reproduce only in bee colonies. It directly weakens its host by sucking up the bee's fat, and can spread [[RNA virus]]es including [[deformed wing virus]]. Heavy infestation causes the death of a colony, generally over the winter. Since 2006, more than 10 million beehives have been lost.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzmán-Novoa E, Eccles L, Calvete Y, Mcgowan J, Kelly PG, Correa-Benítez A |year=2009 |url=http://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2010/04/m09037.pdf |title=''Varroa destructor'' is the main culprit for the death and reduced populations of overwintered honey bee (''Apis mellifera'') colonies in Ontario, Canada |journal=[[Apidologie]] |doi=10.1051/apido/2009076 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=443–450|s2cid=10898654 }}</ref><ref name="Benjamin">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/02/food-fear-mystery-beehives-collapse | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | vauthors = Benjamin A | title=Fears for crops as shock figures from America show scale of bee catastrophe | date=2 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Biological pest control ===
Various mites prey on other invertebrates and can be used to control their populations. [[Phytoseiidae]], especially members of ''[[Amblyseius]]'', ''[[Metaseiulus]]'', and ''[[Phytoseiulus]]'', are used to control pests such as spider mites.<ref>{{Cite web |title=twospotted spider mite - Tetranychus urticae Koch |url=https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/orn/twospotted_mite.htm |access-date=2023-02-09 |website=entnemdept.ufl.edu}}</ref> Among the [[Laelapidae]], ''[[Gaeolaelaps aculeifer]]'' and ''[[Stratiolaelaps scimitus]]'' are used to control [[Sciaridae|fungus gnats]], [[Dermanyssus gallinae|poultry red mites]] and various soil pests.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Park J, Mostafiz MM, Hwang HS, Jung DO, Lee KY |date=2021-05-25 |title=Comparing the Life Table and Population Projection of Gaeolaelaps aculeifer and Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Acari: Laelapidae) Based on the Age-Stage, Two-Sex Life Table Theory |journal=Agronomy |language=en |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1062 |doi=10.3390/agronomy11061062 |issn=2073-4395|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===In culture===
Mites were first observed under the [[microscope]] by the English polymath [[Robert Hooke]].
