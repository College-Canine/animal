=== Dependency ===
[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone was short but may take weeks or months<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.medicinenet.com/steroid_withdrawal/article.htm |title=Steroid Drug Withdrawal Symptoms, Treatment & Prognosis |work=MedicineNet |access-date=14 June 2018 }}</ref> if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an [[Adrenal crisis|Addisonian crisis]]. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/NewLook/CE/glucocort/lesson.htm |title=Therapeutic and Adverse Effects of Glucocorticoids | vauthors = Bello CS, Garrett SD |work=U.S. Pharmacist Continuing Education Program |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711145809/http://www.uspharmacist.com/NewLook/CE/glucocort/lesson.htm |archive-date=11 July 2008}}</ref>

Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the [[hypothalamus]], decreasing [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), and [[corticotrophs]] in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, decreasing the amount of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again.

Prednisone may start to result in the suppression of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis]] if used at doses 7–10&nbsp;mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and [[atrophy]]. If this occurs the patient should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids.

=== Withdrawal ===
The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have:

* received more than 40&nbsp;mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than one week
* been given repeat doses in the evening
* received more than three weeks of treatment
* recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than three weeks)
* taken a short course within one year of stopping long-term therapy
* other possible causes of adrenal suppression

Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for three weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above.

During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5&nbsp;mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Iliopoulou A, Abbas A, Murray R |date=19 May 2013 |title=How to manage withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy |journal=Prescriber |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=23–29 |doi=10.1002/psb.1060|s2cid=72082017 }}</ref>

===Lodotra===
"Lodotra" is the brand name of an oral formulation, which releases prednisone four hours after ingestion. It is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness. Taken at 10&nbsp;p.m., it releases the drug at around&nbsp;2 a.m. The plasmic peak level is reached at 4&nbsp;a.m., which is considered to be the optimal time for relieving morning stiffness. The drug was approved in the [[European Union]], in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2009---January/08/Delayed-release-prednisone-Lodotra-approved-in-EU-for-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/|title=Delayed-release prednisone (Lodotra™) approved in EU for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis|vauthors=Wan Y|date=8 January 2009|access-date=22 November 2009|archive-date=9 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709195015/http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2009---January/08/Delayed-release-prednisone-Lodotra-approved-in-EU-for-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buttgereit F, Doering G, Schaeffler A, Witte S, Sierakowski S, Gromnica-Ihle E, Jeka S, Krueger K, Szechinski J, Alten R | title = Efficacy of modified-release versus standard prednisone to reduce duration of morning stiffness of the joints in rheumatoid arthritis (CAPRA-1): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608 | pages = 205–214 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18207016 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60132-4 | s2cid = 6197980 }}</ref>

==History==
The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by [[Arthur Nobile]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wainwright M | title = The secret of success: Arthur Nobile's discovery of the steroids prednisone and prednisolone in the 1950s revolutionised the treatment of arthritis | journal = Chemistry in Britain | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | date = 1998 | pages = 46 | oclc = 106716069 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Inventor Profile: Arthur Nobile |work = National Inventors Hall of Fame|url= http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/355.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120612062323/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/355.html |archive-date=12 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Arthur Nobile | work=New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame |url= http://www.stevens.edu/njinvent/2000/inductees_2000/nobile.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901232600/http://www.stevens.edu/njinvent/2000/inductees_2000/nobile.html | archive-date = 1 September 2011}}</ref> The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became [[Schering-Plough|Schering-Plough Corporation]], by Arthur Nobile and coworkers.<ref>{{cite book | title = Merck Index | edition = 14th | page = 1327 | date = 2006 | publisher = Merck & Co.

The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice.<ref name="Herzog_1955" />

Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten<ref>{{cite web | title = Meticorten: FDA-Approved Drugs | work = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=009766 }}</ref> and Delta-Cortef,<ref>{{cite web | title = Delta-Cortef: FDA-Approved Drugs | work = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=009987 }}</ref> respectively.
