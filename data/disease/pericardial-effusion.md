A '''pericardial effusion''' is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the [[pericardial cavity]]. The pericardium is a two-part membrane surrounding the heart: the outer fibrous connective membrane and an inner two-layered serous membrane. The two layers of the serous membrane enclose the pericardial cavity (the [[potential space]]) between them.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease">{{cite web |last1=Phelan |first1=D. |last2=Collier |first2=P. |last3=Grimm |first3=R.

[[Echocardiogram]], [[CT scan|CT]] and [[MRI]] are the most common methods of diagnosis, although [[chest X-ray]] and [[EKG]] are also often performed. [[Pericardiocentesis]] may be diagnostic as well as therapeutic (form of treatment).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Pericardial effusion presentation varies from person to person depending on the size, acuity and underlying cause of the effusion.<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> Some people may be asymptomatic and the effusion may be an incidental finding on an examination.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Others with larger effusions may present with [[chest pain|chest]] pressure or pain, [[dyspnea]], [[shortness of breath]], and [[malaise]] (a general feeling of discomfort or illness). Yet others with cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening complication, may present with dyspnea, low [[blood pressure]], weakness, restlessness, hyperventilation (rapid breathing), discomfort with lying flat, dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] or even loss of consciousness.<ref name=":0" /> This causes a type of shock, called obstructive shock, which can lead to organ damage.<ref name="Stashko2021" />

Non-cardiac symptoms may also present due to the enlarging pericardial effusion compressing nearby structures.&nbsp; Some examples are nausea and abdominal fullness, [[dysphagia]] and hiccups, due to compression of stomach, esophagus, and phrenic nerve respectively.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" />

== Causes ==
Any process that leads to injury or inflammation of the pericardium and/or inhibits appropriate lymphatic drainage of the fluid from the pericardial cavity leads to fluid accumulation.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" /> Pericardial effusions can be found in all populations worldwide but the predominant etiology has changed over time, varying depending on the age, location, and comorbidities of the population in question.<ref name=":0" /> Out of all the numerous causes of pericardial effusion, some of the leading causes are inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic and traumatic. These causes can be categorized into various classes, but an easy way to understand them is dividing them into inflammatory versus non-inflammatory.  {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Pericarditis can progress to pericardial effusion and eventually cardiac tamponade.jpg|thumb|Pericardial effusion progresses to cardiac tamponade when the accumulated fluid compresses the heart]]How much fluid is stored in the pericardial sac at one particular time is based on the balance between production and reabsorption. Studies have shown that much of the fluid that accumulates in the pericardial sac is from plasma filtration of the epicardial capillaries and a small amount from the myocardium, while the fluid that is drained is mostly via the parietal lymphatic capillaries.<ref name="Vogiatzidis2015" /> Pericardial effusion usually results from a disturbed equilibrium between these two processes or from a structural abnormality that allows excess fluid to enter the pericardial cavity.<ref name="Vogiatzidis2015" /> Because of the limited amount of anatomic space in the pericardial cavity and the limited elasticity of the pericardium, fluid accumulation beyond the normal amount leads to an increased intrapericardial pressure which can negatively affect [[heart]] function. {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

A pericardial effusion with enough pressure to adversely affect heart function is called [[cardiac tamponade]].<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Pericardial effusions can cause cardiac tamponade in acute settings with fluid as little as 150mL.  In chronic settings, however, fluid can accumulate anywhere up to 2L before an effusion causes cardiac tamponade. The reason behind this is the elasticity of the pericardium. When fluid fills the cavity rapidly, the pericardium cannot stretch rapidly, but in chronic effusions, the gradual fluid collection provides the pericardium enough time to accommodate and stretch with the increasing fluid levels.<ref name=":0" />

== Diagnosis ==
Patients with pericardial effusion may have unremarkable physical exams but often present with [[tachycardia]], distant heart sounds and [[tachypnea]].<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> A physical finding specific to pericardial effusion is dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds and [[egophony]] over the inferior angle of the left scapula. This phenomenon is known as [[Ewart's sign]] and is due to compression of the left lung base.<ref name=":0" />

Patients with concern for cardiac tamponade may present with abnormal vitals and what's classically known as the [[Beck's triad (cardiology)|Beck's triad]], which consists of hypotension (low blood pressure), jugular venous distension and distant heart sounds. Though these are the classical findings; all three occur simultaneously in only a minority of patients.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Patients presenting with cardiac tamponade may also be evaluated for [[pulsus paradoxus]]. Pulsus paradoxus is a phenomenon in which systolic blood pressure drops by 10 mmHg or more during inspiration. In cardiac tamponade, the pressure within the pericardium is significantly higher, hence decreasing the compliance of the chambers (the capacity to expand/ conform to volume changes). During inspiration, right ventricle filling in increased, which causes the [[Interventricular septum]] to bulge into the left ventricle, hence leading to reduced left ventricular filling and consequently reduced stroke volume and low systolic blood pressure.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last1=Willner|first1=Daniel A.|title=Pericardial Effusion|date=2020|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431089/|work=StatPearls|place=Treasure Island (FL)|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=28613741|access-date=2020-11-12|last2=Goyal|first2=Amandeep|last3=Grigorova|first3=Yulia|last4=Kiel|first4=John}}</ref>

===Exams===
[[File:Massivepericarialeffusion.png|thumb|Chest X-ray showing a massive pericardial effusion: Water bottle sign]]
[[File:Pericardial effusion with tamponade.png|thumb|EKG: sinus tachycardia with low QRS voltage and [[electrical alternans]] ]]Some patients with pericardial effusions may present with no symptoms and the diagnosis can be an incidental finding due to imaging of other illnesses. Patients who present with dyspnea or chest pain have a broad [[differential diagnosis]] and it may be necessary to rule out other causes like [[myocardial infarction]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pneumothorax]], acute pericarditis, pneumonia, and esophageal rupture.<ref name=":0" /> Initial tests include [[electrocardiography]] (ECG) and chest x-ray.

'''Chest x-ray:''' is non-specific and may not help identify a pericardial effusion but a very large, chronic effusion can present as "water-bottle sign" on an x-ray, which occurs when the cardiopericardial silhouette is enlarged and assumes the shape of a flask or water bottle.<ref name=":0" /> Chest radiograph is also helpful in ruling out pneumothorax, pneumonia, and esophageal rupture. {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

'''ECG:''' may present with [[sinus tachycardia]], low voltage QRS as well as [[electrical alternans]].<ref name=":0" /> Due to the fluid accumulation around the heart, the heart is further away from the chest leads, which leads to the low voltage QRS. Electrical alternans signifies the up-and-down change of the QRS amplitude with every beat due to the heart swinging in the fluid (as displayed in the ultrasound image in the introduction) .<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> These three findings together should raise suspicion for impending hemodynamic instability associated with cardiac tamponade. {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

'''Echocardiogram (ultrasound):''' when pericardial effusion is suspected, echocardiography usually confirms the diagnosis and allows assessment of the size, location and signs of hemodynamic instability.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" /> A [[transthoracic echocardiogram]] (TTE) is usually sufficient to evaluate pericardial effusion and it may also help distinguish pericardial effusion from pleural effusion and MI. Most pericardial effusions appear as an anechoic area (black or without an echo) between the visceral and the parietal membrane.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Complex or malignant effusions are more heterogeneous in appearance, meaning they may have variations in echo on ultrasound.<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> TTE can also differentiate pericardial effusion based on the size. Although it's difficult to define size classifications because they vary with institutions, most commonly they are as follows: small <10, moderate 10–20, large >20.<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> An echocardiogram is urgently needed for evaluation when there is concern for hemodynamic compromise, a rapidly developing effusion or history of recent cardiac surgery/procedures.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" />

'''Cardiac CT and MRI scans:''' cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) can help localize and quantify the effusion, especially in a loculated   effusion (an effusion contained to one area).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=S|date=Jul–Sep 2014|title=Brief Images: Massive pericardial effusion|journal=Images in Paediatric Cardiology|volume=16|issue=3|pages=1–3|pmc=4521324|pmid=26236369}}</ref> CT imaging also helps assess for pericardial pathology (pericardial thickening, constrictive pericarditis, malignancy-associated pericarditis).<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Whereas cardiac MRI is reserved for patients with poor echocardiogram findings and for assessing pericardial inflammation, especially for patients with continued inflammation despite treatment.<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> CT and MRI imaging can also be used for continued follow up on patients. {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

'''[[Pericardiocentesis]]:''' is a procedure in which fluid is aspirated from the pericardial cavity with a needle and catheter. This procedure can be used to analyze the fluid but more importantly can also provide symptomatic relief, especially in patients with hemodynamic compromise. Pericardiocentesis is usually guided by an echocardiogram to determine the exact location of the effusion and the optimal location of puncture site to minimize risk of complications.<ref name="McIntyre2015" /> After the procedure, the aspirated fluid is analyzed for gross appearance (color, consistency, bloody), cell count, and concentration of glucose, protein, and other cellular components (for example [[lactate dehydrogenase]]).<ref name="Kopcinovic2014">{{cite journal |last1=Kopcinovic |first1=Lara Milevoj |last2=Culej |first2=Jelena |date=15 February 2014 |title=Pleural, peritoneal and pericardial effusions - a biochemical approach |journal=Biochemia Medica |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=123–137 |doi=10.11613/BM.2014.014 |issn=1330-0962 |pmc=3936968 |pmid=24627721}}</ref> Fluid may be also sent for gram stain, acid fast stain, or culture if high suspicion of infectious cause.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Bloody fluids may also be evaluated for malignant cells.<ref name="Kopcinovic2014" />

Fluid analysis may result in:
* ''transudative effusion: due to non-inflammatory causes (''[[congestive heart failure]] , [[myxoedema]] , [[nephrotic syndrome]] )
* ''exudative'' effusion: inflammatory or malignant causes ([[tuberculosis]] , spread from [[empyema]] , [[metastasis]])
* ''hemorrhagic'' effusion: high blood concentration (trauma, rupture of aneurysms, malignant effusion)

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the heart impairment.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> For example, pericardial effusion from autoimmune etiologies may benefit from anti-inflammatory medications. Pericardial effusion due to a viral infection usually resolves within a few weeks without any treatment.<ref name="Imazio2015" /> Small pericardial effusions without any symptoms don't require treatment and may be watched with serial ultrasounds.<ref name=":0" /> If the effusion is compromising heart function and causing cardiac tamponade, it will need to be drained.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> Fluid can be drained via needle pericardiocentesis as discussed above or surgical procedures, such as a [[pericardial window]].<ref name=":0" /> The intervention used depends on the cause of pericardial effusion and the clinical status of the patient.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Pericardiocentesis is the choice of treatment in unstable patients: it can be performed at the bedside and in a timely manner.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" /> A drainage tube is often left in place for 24 hours or more for assessment of re-accumulation of fluid and also for continued drainage.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" /> Patients with cardiac tamponade are also given IV fluids and/or [[vasopressors]] to increase systemic blood pressure and cardiac output.<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" />

But in localized or malignant effusions, surgical drainage may be required instead. This is most often done by cutting through the pericardium and creating a pericardial window<ref name="urlPericardial Disease" /> This window provides a path for the fluid to be drained directly into the chest cavity, which prevents future development of cardiac tamponade. In localized effusions, it might be difficult to get safe access for pericardiocentesis, hence a surgical procedure is preferred. In case of malignant effusions, the high likelihood of recurrence of fluid accumulation is the main reason for a surgical procedure.<ref name="Vakamudi2017" /> Pericardiocentesis is not preferred for chronic treatment options due to risk of infection.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
