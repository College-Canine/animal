<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Intussusception''' is a medical condition in which a part of the [[intestine]] [[invaginate|folds into]] the section immediately ahead of it.<ref name=Mar2017/> It typically involves the [[small bowel]] and less commonly the [[large bowel]].<ref name=Mar2017/> Symptoms include abdominal pain which may come and go, vomiting, abdominal bloating, and bloody stool.<ref name=Mar2017/> It often results in a [[small bowel obstruction]].<ref name=Mar2017/> Other complications may include [[peritonitis]] or [[bowel perforation]].<ref name=Mar2017>{{cite journal|last1=Marsicovetere|first1=P|last2=Ivatury|first2=SJ|last3=White|first3=B|last4=Holubar|first4=SD|title=Intestinal Intussusception: Etiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment.|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|date=February 2017|volume=30|issue=1|pages=30–39|pmid=28144210|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1593429|pmc=5179276}}</ref>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
The cause in children is typically unknown; in adults a ''lead point'' is sometimes present.<ref name=Mar2017/> Risk factors in children include certain infections, diseases like [[cystic fibrosis]], and [[intestinal polyp]]s.<ref name=Mar2017/> Risk factors in adults include [[endometriosis]], [[bowel adhesions]], and [[intestinal tumors]].<ref name=Mar2017/> Diagnosis is often supported by [[medical imaging]].<ref name=Mar2017/> In children, [[ultrasound]] is preferred while in adults a [[CT scan]] is preferred.<ref name=Mar2017/>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
Intussusception is an emergency requiring rapid treatment.<ref name=Mar2017/> Treatment in children is typically by an [[enema]] with surgery used if this is not successful.<ref name=Mar2017/> [[Dexamethasone]] may decrease the risk of another episode.<ref name=Gl2017>{{cite journal|last1=Gluckman|first1=S|last2=Karpelowsky|first2=J|last3=Webster|first3=AC|last4=McGee|first4=RG|title=Management for intussusception in children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=1 June 2017|volume=2017|issue=6|pages=CD006476|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006476.pub3|pmid=28567798|pmc=6481850}}</ref> In adults, [[bowel resection|surgical removal of part of the bowel]] is more often required.<ref name=Mar2017/> Intussusception occurs more commonly in children than adults.<ref name=Mar2017/> In children, males are more often affected than females.<ref name=Mar2017/> The usual age of occurrence is six to eighteen months old.<ref name=Mar2017/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Early symptoms can include periodic abdominal pain, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] (sometimes green in color from [[bile]]), pulling legs to the chest area, and intermittent moderate to severe cramping [[abdominal pain]]. Pain is intermittent—not because the intussusception temporarily resolves, but because the intussuscepted bowel segment transiently stops contracting. Later signs include [[rectal bleeding]], often with "red currant jelly" stool (stool mixed with blood and mucus), and lethargy.  Physical examination may reveal a "sausage-shaped" mass, felt upon [[palpation|palpating]] the abdomen.<ref name=Cera>{{cite journal|author=Cera, SM|title=Intestinal Intussusception|journal=Clin Colon Rectal Surg|date=2008|volume=21|issue=2|pages=106–13|pmid=20011406|issn=1531-0043|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1075859|pmc=2780199}}</ref> Children, or those unable to communicate symptoms verbally, may [[cry]], draw their knees up to their chest, or experience [[dyspnea]] (difficult or painful breathing) with paroxysms of pain.

[[Fever]] is not a symptom of intussusception. However, intussusception can cause a loop of bowel to become [[Necrosis|necrotic]], secondary to [[ischemia]] due to compression to arterial blood supply. This leads to perforation and [[sepsis]], which causes fever.

In rare cases, intussusception may be a complication of [[Henoch–Schönlein purpura]], an immune-mediated [[vasculitis]] disease in children. Such patients who develop intussusception often present with severe abdominal pain in addition to the classic signs and symptoms of HSP.

==Cause==
Causes of intussusception are not clearly established or understood. About 90% of cases of intussusception in children arise from an unknown cause.<ref name=Mar2017/> They can include infections, anatomical factors, and altered motility.{{cn|date=May 2022}}

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Intussusception EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Drawing of intussusception]]
In the most frequent type of intussusception, the [[ileum]] enters the [[cecum]]. However, other types occur, such as when a part of the ileum or [[jejunum]] prolapses into itself.

The part that prolapses into the other is called the ''intussusceptum'', and the part that receives it is called the ''intussuscipiens''. Almost all intussusceptions occur with the intussusceptum having been located [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]]ly to the intussuscipiens. This is because [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] action of the intestine pulls the proximal segment into the distal segment. There are, however, rare reports of the opposite being true.

An anatomic ''lead point'' (that is, a piece of intestinal tissue that protrudes into the bowel lumen) is present in approximately 10% of intussusceptions.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s10c04.html Chapter X.4. Intussusception ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826234901/http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s10c04.html |date=2012-08-26 }} from Case Based Pediatrics For Medical Students and Residents, by Lynette L. Young, MD. Department of Pediatrics, University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. December 2002</ref> The lead point (best exemplified by a polyp) serves as a focal area of traction, which the peristaltic action pulls into the distal bowel, thus invaginating the attached bowel segment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Marsicovetere|first1=Priscilla|last2=Ivatury|first2=S.|last3=White|first3=Brent|last4=Holubar|first4=Stefan|date=2016-12-22|title=Intestinal Intussusception: Etiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=030–039|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1593429|issn=1531-0043|pmc=5179276|pmid=28144210}}</ref>

The trapped section of bowel may have its blood supply cut off, which causes [[ischemia]] (lack of oxygen in the tissues). The [[mucosa]] (gut lining) is very sensitive to [[ischemia]], and responds by sloughing off into the gut. This creates the classically described "red currant jelly" stool, which is a mixture of sloughed mucosa, blood, and mucus.<ref name=Toso>{{cite journal|vauthors=Toso C, Erne M, Lenzlinger PM, Schmid JF, Büchel H, Melcher G, Morel P|title=Intussusception as a cause of bowel obstruction in adults|journal=Swiss Med Wkly|date=2005|volume=135|issue=5–6|pages=87–90|doi=10.4414/smw.2005.10693 |pmid=15729613|s2cid=10471819 |url=http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2005/05/smw-10693.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103054/http://www.smw.ch/docs/pdf200x/2005/05/smw-10693.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24}}</ref> A study reported that in actuality, only a minority of children with intussusception had stools that could be described as "red currant jelly", and hence intussusception should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children passing ''any'' type of bloody stool.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=LG|author2=Morita, SY |author3=Boychuk, RB |author4=Inaba, AS |author5=Rosen, LM |author6=Yee, LL |author7= Young, LL |title=Stool appearance in intussusception: assessing the value of the term "currant jelly."|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=May 1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=293–8|pmid=9148991 |doi=10.1016/s0735-6757(97)90019-x}}</ref>

[[File:Invagination Sonografie.jpg|thumb|An [[ultrasound]] shows a target sign—characteristic for intussusception]]
An intussusception is often suspected based on history and physical exam, including observation of [[Dance's sign]].  A digital [[rectal examination]] is particularly helpful in children, as part of the intussusceptum may be felt by the finger. A definite diagnosis often requires confirmation by diagnostic imaging modalities. [[Ultrasound]] is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis and exclusion of intussusception, due to its high accuracy and lack of radiation. The appearance of target sign (also called "doughnut sign" on a sonograph, usually around 3&nbsp;cm in diameter, confirms the diagnosis. The image seen on transverse [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] or [[Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis|computed tomography]] is that of a doughnut shape, created by the [[hyperechogenicity|hyperechoic]] central core of [[Human gastrointestinal tract#Lower gastrointestinal tract|bowel]] and [[mesentery]] surrounded by the [[hypoechogenicity|hypoechoic]] outer [[edema]]tous bowel.<ref name=Park/> In longitudinal imaging, intussusception resembles a sandwich.<ref name=Park>{{cite journal |vauthors=Park NH, Park SI, Park CS, Lee EJ, Kim MS, Ryu JA, Bae JM |title=Ultrasonographic findings of small bowel intussusception, focusing on differentiation from ileocolic intussusception|journal=Br J Radiol|date =2007|volume=80|issue=958|pages=798–802 |pmid=17875595 |issn=0007-1285|doi=10.1259/bjr/61246651 }}</ref> It is also called "pseudokidney" sign because hyperechoic tubular centre is covered by a hypoechoic rim producing a kidney-like appearance.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Charles |first1=T. |last2=Penninga |first2=L. |last3=Reurings |first3=J.

===Differential diagnosis===

An intussusception has two main differential diagnoses: acute [[gastroenteritis]] and [[rectal prolapse]]. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and stool with mucus and blood are present in acute gastroenteritis, but diarrhea is the leading symptom. Rectal prolapse can be differentiated by projecting mucosa that can be felt in continuity with the perianal skin, whereas in intussusception the finger may pass indefinitely into the depth of the [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]].

==Treatment==
The condition is not usually immediately life-threatening. The intussusception can be treated with either a barium or water-soluble contrast [[enema]] or an air-contrast enema, which both confirms the diagnosis of intussusception, and in most cases successfully reduces it.<ref name="LMCC">Chowdhury SH, Cozma AI, Chowdhury JH. Abdominal Pain in Pediatrics. Essentials for the Canadian Medical Licensing Exam: Review and Prep for MCCQE Part I. 2nd edition. Wolters Kluwer. Hong Kong. 2017.</ref> The success rate is over 80%.  However, approximately 5–10% of these recur within 24 hours.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Cases where it cannot be reduced by an enema or the intestine is damaged require surgical reduction. In a surgical reduction, the surgeon opens the abdomen and manually squeezes (rather than pulls) the part that has telescoped. If the surgeon cannot successfully reduce it, or the bowel is damaged, they [[Segmental resection|resect]] the affected section. More often, the intussusception can be reduced by [[laparoscopy]], pulling the segments of intestine apart with forceps.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Prognosis ==
Intussusception may become a [[medical emergency]] if not treated early, as it eventually causes death if not reduced. In developing countries where medical hospitals are not easily accessible, especially when other problems complicate the intussusception, death becomes almost inevitable. When intussusception or any other severe medical problem is suspected, the person must be taken to a hospital immediately.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The outlook for intussusception is excellent when treated quickly, but when untreated it can lead to death within two to five days. It requires fast treatment, because the longer the intestine segment is prolapsed the longer it goes without bloodflow, and the less effective a non-surgical reduction is.  Prolonged intussusception also increases the likelihood of bowel ischemia and necrosis, requiring surgical resection.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Epidemiology==
The condition is more common in children than in adults.<ref name="pmid34026581">{{cite journal | vauthors = Panzera F, Di Venere B, Rizzi M, Biscaglia A, Praticò CA, Nasti G, Mardighian A, Nunes TF, Inchingolo R | title = Bowel intussusception in adult: Prevalence, diagnostic tools and therapy | journal = World Journal of Methodology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 81–87 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 34026581 | pmc = 8127421 | doi = 10.5662/wjm.v11.i3.81 | url =  | doi-access = free }}</ref> It strikes about 2,000 infants (one in every 1,900) in the United States in the first year of life. Its incidence begins to rise at about one to five months of life, peaks at four to nine months of age, and then gradually declines at around 18 months.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Intussusception occurs more frequently in boys than in girls, with a ratio of approximately 3:1.<ref name="eMedicine.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic385.htm|title=Pediatrics: Intussusception|access-date=2006-06-05|year=2006|author=Lonnie King|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518161052/http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic385.htm|archive-date=2006-05-18}}</ref>
