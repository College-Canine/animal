'''Pus''' is an [[exudate]], typically white-yellow, yellow, or yellow-brown, formed at the site of [[inflammation]] during infections, regardless of cause.<ref>

</ref> An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is known as an [[abscess]], whereas a visible collection of pus within or beneath the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is known as a [[pustule]], [[pimple]] or spot.

==Description==
Pus consists of a thin, [[protein]]-rich fluid (historically known as ''liquor puris''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KD1HAAAAYAAJ&q=%22liquor+puris%22|title=British Medical Journal|date=1917|publisher=British Medical Association|pages=751–754|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LA1AQAAMAAJ&q=%22liquor+puris%22&pg=PA251|title=Journal|last=Society|first=Louisiana State Medical|date=1846|pages=251|language=en}}</ref>) and dead [[leukocytes]] from the body's [[immune response]] (mostly [[neutrophils]]).<ref name="Barer 2012 pp. 168–173">{{cite book | last=Barer | first=M.R. | title=Medical Microbiology | pages=168–173 | chapter=The natural history of infection | publisher=Elsevier | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7020-4089-4 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-7020-4089-4.00029-9 }}</ref> During infection, [[T helper cells]] release [[cytokine]]s, which trigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection by [[chemotaxis]]. There, the neutrophils release [[Neutrophil granule|granules]], which destroy the bacteria. The bacteria resist the immune response by releasing [[toxins]] called [[leukocidin]]s.<ref name=Biology>Madigan, Michael T. and Martin, John M. Brock Biology of Microorganisms 11th ed. Pearson Prentice Hall. US. 2006: 734</ref> As the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are [[phagocytosis|destroyed]] by macrophages, forming the viscous pus. Bacteria that cause pus are called pyogenic.<ref name="Biology" /><ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000088920|pyogenic}}</ref>

Although pus is normally of a whitish-yellow hue, changes in the color can be observed under certain circumstances. Pus is sometimes green because of the presence of [[myeloperoxidase]], an intensely green antibacterial protein produced by some types of white blood cells. Green, foul-smelling pus is found in certain infections of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. The greenish color is a result of the bacterial pigment [[pyocyanin]] that it produces. [[Amoebic]] abscesses of the [[liver]] produce brownish pus, which is described as looking like "[[anchovy paste]]". Pus from anaerobic infections can more often have a foul odor.<ref name="Topazian 2002">{{cite book|vauthors=Topazian RG, Goldberg MH, Hupp JR |title=Oral and maxillofacial infections|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0721692715|edition=4}}</ref>

In almost all cases when there is a collection of pus in the body, a clinician will try to create an opening to drain it. This principle has been distilled into the famous [[Latin language|Latin]] [[aphorism]] "''[[Ubi pus, ibi evacua]]''" ("Where there is pus, evacuate it").

Some disease processes caused by pyogenic infections are [[impetigo]],<ref name=Dermatopathology>{{citation|pages=83–85|chapter=Infections Caused by Common Pyogenic Bacteria|publisher=Springer |location=Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-30244-1_12|title=Dermatopathology|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-30245-2|doi-access=free}}</ref> [[osteomyelitis]], [[septic arthritis]] and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].

==Pyogenic bacteria==
Many species of bacteria may be involved in the production of pus.

==Historical terminology==
{{anchor|historical}}
In the pre-[[asepsis]] era, surgeon [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] (1853–1923) wrote,
"Practically all major wounds [[wiktionary:suppurate#Verb|suppurate]]d. Pus was the most common subject of converse [among surgeons], because it was the most prominent feature in the surgeon's work. It was classified according to degrees of vileness."{{px1}}{{r|nuland|page=347}}
But pus of the right kind was considered desirable.{{r|vanhoosen|page=80}}
"If a patient was lucky{{nbsp}}... a thick cream-colored odorless fluid would appear within five or six days";
such "laudable" pus was considered "a sure sign that the wound would heal"{{px1}}{{r|nuland|page=344}}
because it meant "Nature has put up a bold fight against the invader".{{r|scott}}
"On the other hand, if the pus gradually became watery, blood tinged and foul smelling, it was designated 'sanious'{{px1}}{{r|schneider}}
[or 'ill-conditioned'{{px1}}]{{px1}}{{r|williams}}
and the wound condition was considered unfavorable".{{r|schneider}}
It later came to be understood that "laudable" pus generally implied an invasion of relatively benign [[staphylococcus]], while "ill-conditioned" pus usually meant the more dangerous [[streptococcus]] was present.{{r|nuland|page1=345|schneider|page2=247}}
