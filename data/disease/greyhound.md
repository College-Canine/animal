The '''English''' '''Greyhound''', or simply the '''Greyhound''', is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]], a [[sighthound]] which has been bred for [[coursing]], [[greyhound racing]] and hunting. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.

Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the [[Italian greyhound]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greyhound Dog Breed Information|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/greyhound/|access-date=2021-10-07|website=American Kennel Club|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Greyhound Type - The Archtypical Sighthound|url=https://www.greyhoundclubofamericainc.org/greyhound-type/|access-date=2021-10-07|website=Greyhound Club Of America|language=en-US}}</ref>

Greyhounds tend to be out-going, happy and sociable with people and seem to relish human contact, even following owners from room to room at home (known colloquially as being a "Velcro dog").

=== Coursing ===
{{Main|Hare coursing}}

[[File:Gray-Hound.jpg|thumb|"Gray-Hound" in a 1658 English woodcut]]
The original primary use of Greyhounds, both in the British Isles and on the Continent of Europe, was in the coursing of deer for meat and sport; later, specifically in Britain, they specialized in competition [[hare coursing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/turbervilesbooke00turb/page/246|title=Turbervile's Booke of hunting, 1576|first=George|last=Turberville|date=7 October 2018|publisher=[Oxford] : Clarendon Press; New York : [Oxford University Press]|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Some Greyhounds are still used for coursing, although artificial lure sports like [[lure coursing]] and racing are far more common and popular. Many leading 300- to 550-yard sprinters have bloodlines traceable back through Irish sires, within a few generations of racers that won events such as the [[Irish Coursing Club|Irish Coursing Derby]] or the Irish Cup.<ref>Irish Greyhound Stud Book</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Gunnar von Boehn |url=http://www.greyhound-data.com/ |title=The Greyhound Breeding and Racing Database |publisher=Greyhound-data.com |access-date=2011-05-31}}</ref>

=== Racing ===
{{Main|Greyhound racing}}
Until the early 20th century, Greyhounds were principally bred and trained for hunting and [[coursing]]. During the 1920s, modern greyhound racing was introduced into the United States, England (1926), Northern Ireland (1927), Scotland (1927), and the Republic of Ireland (1927).<ref name="genders90">{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}</ref> Australia also has a significant racing culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsaustralia.org/issues/greyhound-racing.php |title=Greyhound racing |publisher=[[Animals Australia]] |access-date=3 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agra.com.au/HallOfFameTribute.aspx?id=5|title=Tribute to Chief Havoc -- Australian Greyhound Racing Association|access-date=2014-10-20|archive-date=2015-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605201107/http://www.agra.com.au/HallOfFameTribute.aspx?id=5|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grey2kusa.org/about/worldwide/australia.php|title=Greyhound Racing in Australia &#124; GREY2K USA Worldwide|website=www.grey2kusa.org}}</ref>

In the United States, aside from professional racing, many Greyhounds enjoy success on the amateur race track. Organizations like the Large Gazehound Racing Association (LGRA) and the National Oval Track Racing Association (NOTRA) provide opportunities for Greyhounds to compete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lgra.org |title=Large Gazehound Racing Association |publisher=Lgra.org |access-date=2011-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.notra.org |title=National Oval Track Racing Association |publisher=Notra.org |access-date=2011-05-31}}</ref>

== Companion ==
Historically, the Greyhound has, since its first appearance as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree of fame and definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at re-homing dogs has redefined the breed as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. This has been prevalent in recent years due to track closures in the United States.<ref>Flaim, Denise (2010) 'Forward Thinking', ''Sighthound Review'', Vol 1 Issue 1.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blogher.com/dog-racetracks-close-where-do-all-greyhounds-go |title=As Dog Racetracks Close, Where Do All the Greyhounds Go? |publisher=BlogHer |access-date=2011-05-31 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085100/http://www.blogher.com/dog-racetracks-close-where-do-all-greyhounds-go |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Madden, Raymond (2010) 'Imagining the greyhound: 'Racing' and 'rescue' narratives in a human and dog relationship', ''Continuum'', 24: 4, 503 — 515 .</ref> Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The key to the speed of a Greyhound can be found in its light but muscular build, large [[heart]], highest percentage of [[Myocyte#Fiber types|fast twitch muscle]] of any breed,<ref>Snow, D.H. and Harris R.C.

Due to the Greyhound's unique physiology and anatomy, a veterinarian who understands the issues relevant to the breed is generally needed when the dogs need treatment, particularly when [[anesthesia]] is required. Greyhounds cannot metabolize [[barbiturate]]-based anesthesia in the same way that other breeds can because their [[liver]]s have lower amounts of [[oxidative enzyme]]s.<ref>Blythe, Linda, Gannon, James, Craig, A.

Greyhounds have higher levels of [[red blood cell]]s than other breeds. Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles.<ref>Blythe, Linda, Gannon, James, Craig, A.

Greyhounds do not have undercoats and thus are less likely to trigger dog allergies in humans (they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as "[[hypoallergenic]]"). The lack of an undercoat, coupled with a general lack of body fat, also makes Greyhounds more susceptible to extreme temperatures (both hot and cold); because of this, they must be housed inside.<ref>Blythe, Linda, Gannon, James, Craig, A.

During the [[Middle Ages]], greyhounds could only be owned by rulers and nobles, having long been associated with heraldic symbols of the ruling class in England, France, and the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] lands.<ref name=remains/>

The earliest archaeological discovery found conclusively to be a greyhound specifically was at the [[Chotěbuz]] fort in the [[Czech Republic]]. This comprised sighthound type "gracile" bones dating from the 8th to 9th century AD.  These bones matched those of a {{cvt|70|cm}} high "greyhound", and were also genetically compared with the modern Greyhound and other sighthounds, and found to be almost completely identical with the modern Greyhound breed, with the exception of only four deletions and one substitution in the DNA sequences, which were interpreted as differences probably arising from 11 centuries of breeding of this type of dog.<ref name=remains/>

All modern pedigree Greyhounds derive from the Greyhound stock recorded and registered first in private studbooks in the 18th century, then in public studbooks in the 19th century, which ultimately were registered with coursing, racing, and kennel club authorities of the United Kingdom.<ref>''The Greyhound and the Hare: A history of the breed and the sport'' Charles Blanning, The National Coursing Club, 2018</ref> Historically, these [[sighthound]]s were used primarily for hunting in the open where their pursuit speed and keen [[eyesight]] were essential.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

===Etymology===
The name "Greyhound" is generally believed to come from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|'[[wikt:grighund|grighund]]'}}. {{lang|ang|Hund}} is the antecedent of the modern "hound", but the meaning of {{lang|ang|grig}} is undetermined, other than in reference to dogs in Old English and [[Old Norse]]. The word "hund" is still used for dogs in general in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] today. Its origin does not appear to have any common root with the modern word "grey"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Charles |title=A New Dictionary of the English Language |date=1839 |publisher=Oxford University |page=357}}</ref> for color, and indeed the Greyhound is seen with a wide variety of coat colors. The lighter colors, patch-like markings and white appeared in the breed that was once ordinarily grey in color.<ref>{{Cite web |last=admin |date=2020-06-21 |title=Greyhound |url=https://www.nativebreed.org/greyhound/ |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=Native Breed.org |language=en-US}}</ref>

The Greyhound is the only dog mentioned by name in the [[Bible]] ({{Lang-he|זַרְזִיר מׇתְנַיִם}}, ''zarir mosna'im'') in {{bibleverse|Proverbs|30:29-31|JPS}}.{{Primary source inline|date=December 2023}} Many versions, including the [[Jewish Publication Society]] and [[King James Version]], name the Greyhound as one of the "three that are stately of stride". However, some newer biblical translations, including the [[New International Version]], have changed this to 'strutting rooster', which appears to be an alternative translation. However, the [[Douay–Rheims Bible]] translation from the late 4th-century Latin [[Vulgate]] into English translates this term as "a [[rooster|cock]]".{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}{{Original research inline|date=December 2023}}

According to [[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny]],<ref name="Pokorny">Pokorny, ''Indogermanisches Woerterbuch'', pp. 441–442.</ref> the English term 'Greyhound' does not mean "grey dog/hound", but simply "fair dog". Subsequent words have been derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] '''*g'her-''' "shine, twinkle": English 'grey', [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|gris}} "grey, old", [[Old Norse|Old Icelandic]] {{transl|non|griss}} "piglet, pig", Old Icelandic {{transl|non|gryja}} "to dawn", {{transl|non|gryjandi}} "morning twilight", [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] {{lang|sga|grian}} "sun", [[Old Church Slavonic]] {{transl|cu|zorja}} "morning twilight, brightness". The common sense of these words is "to shine; bright".{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}

Historically, English Greyhounds were grouped: two for coursing, as a "Brace", three for hunting, as a "Leash", otherwise known as a "couple and a half".<ref>''Turbervile's Booke of Hunting 1576'' Clarendon Press 1908 p242</ref>
