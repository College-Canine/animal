The '''Great Dane''' is a German [[dog breed|breed]] of large [[mastiff]]-[[sighthound]], which descends from hunting dogs of the [[Middle Ages]] used to hunt [[bear|bears]], [[wild boar]], and [[deer]]. They were also used as [[Guardian dog|guardian dogs]] of German nobility. It is one of the two largest dog breeds in the world, along with the [[Irish Wolfhound]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Frederick |title=The Great Dane: Embodying a Full Exposition of the History, Breeding Principles, Education, and Present State of the Breed |year=1905 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=1-905124-85-6 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Great Dane Dog Breed Information |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/ |access-date=2022-04-16 |website=American Kennel Club |language=en}}</ref><ref>[https://a-z-animals.com/blog/top-11-heaviest-dogs/ Top 11 heaviest dog breeds]</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Tiryns fresco.JPG|thumb|left|Wall painting fragments with a representation of a wild boar hunt. From the later [[Tiryns]] palace ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]])]]

=== Origins ===
In the middle of the 16th century, the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs from England, which were descended from crossbreeds between [[English Mastiff]]s and [[Irish Wolfhound]]s. They were dog hybrids in different sizes and [[phenotype]]s with no formal breed.<ref name="Beckmann S 6">Ludwig Beckmann (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/geschichteundbes02beck#page/6/mode/2up ''Geschichte und Beschreibung der Rassen des Hundes''], Volume 1, p. 6 (in German)</ref> These dogs were called ''Englische Docke'' or ''Englische Tocke'' – later written and spelled: ''Dogge'' – or ''Englischer Hund'' in Germany. The name simply meant "English dog". Since then, the English word "dog" has come to be associated with a molossoid dog in Germany<ref>The German standard term for "dog" is ''Hund''; the term ''Dogge'' is only in use for dogs of the mastiff type.</ref> and France.<ref>The French standard term for "dog" is ''chien''; the term ''dogue'' is only used for dogs of the mastiff type.</ref> These dogs were bred in the courts of German nobility, independent of the English methods, since the start of the 17th century.<ref name="Beckmann S 7">Ludwig Beckmann. ''[https://archive.org/stream/geschichteundbes02beck#page/7/mode/2up Geschichte und Beschreibung der Rassen des Hundes]'', Volume 1, 1895, p. 7 (German)</ref><ref>Johann Täntzer. "Von den Englischen Hunden" ["On the English dogs"]. In ''Jagdbuch oder der Dianen hohe und niedrige Jagdgeheimnisse'' [''Hunting-book, or Diana's high and low hunting secrets''], Copenhagen, 1682 (in German): {{Lang|de|"Jetziger Zeit werden solche Hunde jung an Herrenhöfen erzogen, und gar nicht aus England geholet."}} English translation: "Today such dogs are bred at noblemen's courts, and not at all obtained from England." Cited in Ludwig Beckmann (1895). ''Geschichte und Beschreibung der Rassen des Hundes'' [''History and description of the breeds of dogs''], Vol. 1, p. 7</ref>

The dogs were used for hunting [[Brown bear|bear]], [[Wild boar|boar]], and [[Red deer|deer]] at princely courts, with the favorites staying in the bedchambers of their lords at night . These ''Kammerhunde'' (chamber dogs) were outfitted with ornate collars, and helped to protect the sleeping princes from assassins.<ref>Johann Täntzer (1682).

"...&nbsp;such a chamber-hound is mostly put about with a strong leather collar covered with green velvet, on which there are silver letters or the master's name or arms. ... Such body-dogs are also assigned beautiful collars of red or green plush with brass letters."</ref>

While hunting boar or bears, the ''Englische Dogge'' was a [[catch dog]] used after the other [[hunting dogs]] to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, particularly because of the use of firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The ''Englische Dogge'' became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.

=== Name change ===
In 1878, a committee was formed in Berlin which changed the name of the "Englische Dogge" (English mastiff derivatives) to "Deutsche Dogge" (German mastiff), this being the Great Dane. This laid the foundations from which the breed was developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf|title=FCI Breed Standard Great Dane 2012|access-date=15 January 2015|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071603/http://www.fci.be/nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> During the 19th century, the dog was known as a "German boarhound" in English-speaking countries.<ref>S.

The Great Dane is an extremely large [[Dog|domestic dog]] of [[mastiff]]-[[sighthound]] type known for its big size. It is often dubbed the "Apollo of dogs".<ref name=AKC /><ref>Becker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XMcgA992QyEC ''The Great Dane – Embodying a Full Exposition of the History, Breeding Principles, Education, and Present State of the Breed (a Vintage Dog Books Breed Classic): Embodying a Full Exposition the History, Breeding Principles, Education, and Present State of the Breed''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527010120/https://books.google.com/books?id=XMcgA992QyEC |date=27 May 2016 }}, Published by READ BOOKS, 2005, {{ISBN|1-905124-43-0}}.</ref> 

As described by the [[American Kennel Club]]:

<blockquote>The Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, strength, and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds, but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy, and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive.<ref name=AKC /> The Great Dane is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure.<ref name=KCUK>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/51|title=The Home for Dog Owners and Those Working with Dogs: The Kennel Club|work=thekennelclub.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515064003/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/51|archive-date=15 May 2007}}</ref></blockquote> In the ratio between length and height, the Great Dane should be [[Square (geometry)|square]]. The male dog should not be less than {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulders, a female {{convert|28|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Danes under minimum height are disqualified.<ref name=AKC /> Over the years, the tallest living dog has typically been a Great Dane. Previous record holders include [[Gibson (Great Dane)|Gibson]], [[Titan (dog)|Titan]], and [[Giant George|George]]; however, the current record holder is a black Great Dane named [[Zeus (dog, born 2008)|Zeus]] that stood {{convert|111.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder before his death in September 2014.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite news|title=Zeus, the world's tallest dog passes away at the age of 5|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/9/zeus-the-worlds-tallest-dog-passes-away-at-the-age-of-5-60340/|work=Guinness World Records|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312031123/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/9/zeus-the-worlds-tallest-dog-passes-away-at-the-age-of-5-60340/|archive-date=12 March 2016}}</ref> He was also the tallest dog on record (according to Guinness World Records),<ref name="Guinness" /> beating the previous holder, the aforementioned George that stood {{convert|109.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantgeorge.com|title=Giant George, Guinness World Record, Tallest Dog – giantgeorge|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312015955/http://www.giantgeorge.com/|archive-date=12 March 2016}}</ref>

Great Danes have naturally floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were commonly used to [[Boar hunting#Hunting dogs|hunt boars]], [[Cropping (animal)|cropping]] of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily [[Companion dog|companion animals]], cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&q=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&pg=PA873|title=Popular Mechanics|date=5 December 1934|publisher=Hearst Magazines|via=Google Books|access-date=27 October 2021|archive-date=15 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215153306/https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&q=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&pg=PA873|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, the practice is still common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Denmark]], and Germany, and parts of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by [[veterinarian|veterinary surgeons]].

According to the breed standard, Great Danes have six to seven (depending on the standard) show-acceptable [[Coat (dog)|coat colours]]:<ref name=AKC>{{cite web|title=Great Dane Breed Standard|publisher=[[American Kennel Club]]|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/great_dane|year=1999|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050503171729/http://www.akc.org/breeds/great_dane/|archive-date=3 May 2005}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fci.be/nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf FCI Breed Standard N° 235 Great Dane (Deutsche Dogge)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071603/http://www.fci.be/nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf |date=6 October 2014 }} (PDF)</ref>
* Fawn and brindle
**'''[[Fawn (color)|Fawn]]''': The colour is yellow-gold with a [[Melanistic mask|black mask]]. Black should appear on the eye rims and eyebrows and may appear on the ears.
**'''Brindle''': The colour is fawn and black in a chevron striped pattern. Often, they are also referred to as having a striped pattern.
* Black, harlequin and mantle
**'''Black''': The colour is a glossy black. White markings on the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults.
**'''Harlequin''': The base colour is pure white with torn black  patches irregularly distributed over the entire body; a pure white neck is preferred. The black patches should never be large enough to give the appearance of a blanket, nor so small as to give a stippled or dappled effect. Eligible, but less desirable, are a few small patches of grey that is consistent with a merle marking, or a white base with single black hairs showing through, which tend to give a salt and pepper or dirty effect. Merlequin (see below), a white coat with grey patches instead of black, is a disqualification.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 9, 2018 |title=Official Standard of the Great Dane |url=http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/GreatDane.pdf |access-date=March 11, 2022 |website=[[American Kennel Club]]}}</ref>
***'''Grey [[Merle (dog coat)|merle]]''' (''Grautiger'') Great Danes are acceptable in conformation shows under the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]].  This color was previously a disqualifying fault, but the fault was deleted in a new breed standard in 2012 to provide a wider gene pool and because the grey merle gene can produce a correct harlequin coat.<ref name="FCI67-2013">[http://www.fci.be/circulaires/67-2013.pdf Circular 67/2013 of the FCI, 23/12/2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107154817/http://www.fci.be/circulaires/67-2013.pdf |date=7 January 2014 }} (PDF)</ref> Their status is that they are "neither desirable nor to be disqualified".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf|title=F.C.I.

**'''Mantle''' (in some countries referred to as '''Boston''' due to the similar colouration and pattern as a [[Boston Terrier]]): The colour is black and white with a solid black blanket extending over the body; black skull with white muzzle; white blaze is optional; whole white collar preferred; a white chest; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs; white tipped black tail. A small white marking in the black blanket is acceptable, as is a break in the white collar.
*'''Blue''': The colour is a pure steel blue. White markings at the chest and feet are permitted - never with a fawn nuance or blackish-blue colour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf|title=Great Dane Standard FCI|last=Tapio|first=Marjo|date=25 February 2019|website=www.fci.be|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071603/http://www.fci.be/nomenclature/Standards/235g02-en.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
*'''Blue brindle''': This is a brindle coat with a blue-gray background and darker brindle striping.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MOIZ |date=2023-09-12 |title=The Majestic Blue Brindle Great Dane |url=https://petreck.com/blue-brindle-great-dane/ |access-date=2023-09-21 |website=Pet Reck |language=en-us}}</ref>

=== Temperament ===
The Great Dane's large and imposing appearance belies its outgoing and friendly nature that can make it a loving, devoted addition to any home. With proper supervision,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sam |date=2022-12-26 |title=All About Great Dane - Pet Paradise |url=https://www.petparadise.pk/all-about-great-dane/ |access-date=2022-12-26 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ali |first=Sagheer |date=December 26, 2022 |title=ALL ABOUT GREAT DANE |url=https://www.petparadise.pk/all-about-great-dane |website=Pet Paradise}}</ref> they are known for seeking physical affection from their owners or non-owners that they know well. The breed is often referred to as a "gentle giant".<ref name=AKC /><ref name="animal.discovery.com">{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane.htm|title=Great Dane|work=Animal Planet|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619221310/http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane.htm|archive-date=19 June 2012}}</ref>

Great Danes are generally well disposed toward other dogs, other non-canine pets, and familiar humans. They generally do not exhibit extreme aggressiveness or a high [[prey drive]].<ref>''Great Dane: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog'', Kennel Club Book, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59378-273-X}}</ref> With proper care and training, they are great around children, especially when raised with them. However, if not properly socialized, a Great Dane may become fearful or aggressive towards new stimuli (such as strangers and new environments).<ref>{{cite book|last=Biniok|first=Janice|title=Great Dane: a practical guide for the Great Dane|publisher=T.F.H. Publications|location=Neptune City, NJ|isbn=978-0-7938-4178-3|date=10 August 2010}}</ref>

== Health ==
Great Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fast metabolism. This results in more energy and food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat ([[gastric dilatation volvulus]]).<ref name="Great Dane Dog Breed Information">{{Cite web|title=Great Dane Dog Breed Information|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/|access-date=2021-02-18|website=American Kennel Club|language=en|archive-date=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817045341/http://www.akc.org/breeds/great_dane/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nutrition plays a role in this breed's health. Bloat, or gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), is the greatest killer of Great Danes.<ref name="Great Dane Dog Breed Information"/> To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane/|title=Great Dane - Dogs 101 - Animal Planet|website=www.animalplanet.com|access-date=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315025350/https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane|archive-date=15 March 2018}}</ref>

A 2024 UK study found the average life expectancy of the breed to be 10.6 years, compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for [[Mongrel|crossbreeds]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=McMillan | first1=Kirsten M. | last2=Bielby | first2=Jon | last3=Williams | first3=Carys L. | last4=Upjohn | first4=Melissa M. | last5=Casey | first5=Rachel A. | last6=Christley | first6=Robert M. | title=Longevity of companion dog breeds: those at risk from early death | journal=Scientific Reports | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=14 | issue=1 | date=2024-02-01 | issn=2045-2322 | doi=10.1038/s41598-023-50458-w | page=531| pmid=38302530 | pmc=10834484 | bibcode=2024NatSR..14..531M }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McMillan|first1=K.

[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]  and many [[congenital]] heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its [[nickname]]: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan. Great Danes also may carry the merle gene, which is part of the genetic makeup that creates the harlequin coloring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecareforanimals.com/animal-eye-conditions/canine/296-merle-gene.html|publisher=Eye Care for Animals|title=The Merle Gene and Multiple Ocular Abnormalities|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212182621/http://www.eyecareforanimals.com/animal-eye-conditions/canine/296-merle-gene.html|archive-date=12 December 2013}}</ref> The merle gene is an incomplete dominant, meaning only one copy of the gene is needed to show the merle coloring; two merle genes produce excessive white markings and many health issues such as deafness, blindness, or other debilitating ocular issues. Great Danes can also develop [[wobbler disease]], a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebrae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs. This can be treated with surgery or may heal itself over time.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vin.com/doc/?id=6693870|title=World Small Animal Veterinary Association World Congress Proceedings, 2004|website=Vin.com |date=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].{{cn|date=November 2023}}

He derived his design from sketches given to him by a [[Hanna-Barbera]] employee who bred Danes, and then endeavoured to make Scooby the opposite of a perfect pedigree, with a longer tail, bowed legs, small chin and a sloping back.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/arts/television/10takamoto.html?ex=1326085200&en=621fc868fcd67df1&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss "Iwao Takamoto, 81, the Animation Artist Who Created Scooby-Doo, Dies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220190138/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/arts/television/10takamoto.html?ex=1326085200&en=621fc868fcd67df1&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |date=20 December 2016 }}, by Susan Stewart, 10 January 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2007/01/09/scoobydoo-takamoto.html "Iwao Takamoto, cartoonist who created Scooby-Doo, dies at 81"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128034643/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2007/01/09/scoobydoo-takamoto.html |date=28 January 2007 }}, [[The Associated Press]], 9 January 2007, ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]''</ref>

'''Military'''

'''Philosophy'''
* An unnamed Great Dane knocks [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] to the ground in ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]''; he describes the singular feeling of peace and suspended identity that the shock of the collision brings about in him.<ref>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. ''Reveries of a Solitary Walker''. Trans. Charles E. Butterworth. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing (1992), pp. 15–18.</ref>
