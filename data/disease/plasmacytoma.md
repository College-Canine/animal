'''Plasmacytoma''' is a [[plasma cell dyscrasia]] in which a [[plasma cell]] [[tumour]] grows within [[soft tissue]] or within the [[axial skeleton]].

The [[International Myeloma Working Group]] lists three types: [[Plasma cell dyscrasia#Solitary plasmacytoma|solitary plasmacytoma]] of bone (SPB); extramedullary plasmacytoma (EP), and multiple plasmacytomas that are either primary or recurrent.<ref name="pmid12780789"/> The most common of these is SPB, accounting for 3–5% of all plasma cell malignancies.<ref name="pmid15009059"/> SPBs occur as lytic lesions within the axial skeleton and extramedullary plasmacytomas most often occur in the [[upper respiratory tract]] (85%), but can occur in any soft tissue. Approximately half of all cases produce [[paraproteinemia]]. SPBs and extramedullary plasmacytomas are mostly treated with [[radiotherapy]], but surgery is used in some cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma. The skeletal forms frequently progress to [[multiple myeloma]] over the course of 2–4 years.<ref name="pmid16304406"/>

Due to their cellular similarity, plasmacytomas have to be differentiated from [[multiple myeloma]]. For SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma the distinction is the presence of only one lesion (either in bone or soft tissue), normal [[bone marrow]] (<5% plasma cells), normal [[skeletal survey]], absent or low paraprotein and no end organ damage.<ref name="pmid12780789"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
For SPB the most common presenting symptom is that of pain in the affected bone. [[Back pain]] and other consequences of the bone lesion may occur such as [[spinal cord compression]] or [[pathological fracture]]. Around 85% of extramedullary plasmacytoma presents within the [[upper respiratory tract]] [[mucosa]], causing possible symptoms such as [[epistaxis]], [[rhinorrhoea]] and nasal obstruction. In some tissues it may be found as a [[Palpable|palpable mass]].<ref name="pmid12780789"/><ref name="pmid15009059"/><ref name="pmid16304406">{{cite journal |author=Weber DM |title=Solitary bone and extramedullary plasmacytoma |journal=Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program |volume= 2005|pages=373–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16304406 |doi=10.1182/asheducation-2005.1.373 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Serum protein electrophoresis normal and paraprotein.png|thumb|[[Serum protein electrophoresis]] of an individual with polyclonal antibodies (top) and an individual with a large [[paraprotein]] (bottom).]]

The diagnosis of plasmacytoma uses a diverse range of interdisciplinary techniques including [[serum protein electrophoresis]], [[bone marrow biopsy]], urine analysis for [[Bence Jones protein]] and [[complete blood count]], [[projectional radiography|plain film radiography]], [[MRI]] and [[PET-CT]].<ref name="pmid22654647">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilciksiz S, Karakoyun-Celik O, Agaoglu FY, Haydaroglu A |title=A review for solitary plasmacytoma of bone and extramedullary plasmacytoma |journal=ScientificWorldJournal |volume=2012 |pages=1–6 |year=2012 |pmid=22654647 |pmc=3354668 |doi=10.1100/2012/895765 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="pmid19421229" />

Serum protein electrophoresis separates the proteins in the liquid part of the blood (serum), allowing the analysis of antibodies. Normal blood serum contains a range of antibodies and are said to be [[Polyclonal antibodies|polyclonal]], whereas serum from a person with plasmacytoma may show a [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal]] spike. This is due to an outgrowth of a single type of plasma cell that forms the plasmacytoma and produces a single type of antibody. The plasma cells are said to be monoclonal and the excessively produced antibody is known as monoclonal protein or [[paraprotein]].<ref name="pmid15663032">{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connell TX, Horita TJ, Kasravi B |title=Understanding and interpreting serum protein electrophoresis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=105–12 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15663032 }}</ref>  [[Paraprotein]]s are present in 60% of SPB and less than 25% of extramedullary plasmacytoma.<ref name="pmid15009059"/>

Bone marrow biopsies are performed to ensure the disease is localised; and in SPB or extramedullary plasmacytoma there will not be an increase of monoclonal plasma cells. Tissue biopsies of SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma are used to assess the [[phenotype]] of the plasma cells. Histological analyses can be performed on these biopsies to see what [[cluster of differentiation]] (CD) markers are present and to assess monoclonality of the cells. CD markers can aid in the distinction of extramedullary plasmacytoma from lymphomas.<ref name="pmid16304406"/><ref name="2009plasmacytomaupdate">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/solitary_plamacytoma_bcsh_FINAL_190109.pdf|title=Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of solitary plasmacytoma of bone, extramedullary plasmacytoma and multiple solitary plasmacytomas: 2009 update|author1=M.

[[Skeletal survey]]s are used to ensure there are no other [[primary tumors]] within the [[axial skeleton]]. MRI can be used to assess tumor status and may be advantageous in detecting primary tumors that are not detected by plain film radiography. [[PET-CT]] may also be beneficial in detecting extramedullary tumours in individuals diagnosed with SPB. [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] may be better than plain film radiography for assessing bone damage.<ref name="pmid22654647"/><ref name="pmid19421229">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dimopoulos M, Terpos E, Comenzo RL, etal |title=International myeloma working group consensus statement and guidelines regarding the current role of imaging techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple Myeloma |journal=Leukemia |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1545–56 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19421229 |doi=10.1038/leu.2009.89 |s2cid=13264295 |doi-access= }}</ref>

An important distinction to be made is that a true plasmacytoma is present and not a [[systemic disease|systemic]] plasma cell disorder, such as [[multiple myeloma]]. The difference between plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma is that plasmacytoma lacks increased [[blood calcium]], [[renal insufficiency|decreased kidney function]], [[anemia|too few red blood cells]] in the bloodstream, and multiple bone lesions (collectively termed CRAB).<ref name="pmid22654647" />

===Classification===
[[File:Plasmacytoma1.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of a plasmacytoma.]]
Plasmacytoma is a [[tumor]] of [[plasma cell]]s. The cells are identical to those seen in [[multiple myeloma]], but they form discrete masses of cells in the skeleton (solitary plasmacytoma of bone; SPB) or in soft tissues (extramedullary plasmacytoma; EP). They do not present with [[systemic disease]], which would classify them as another systemic plasma cell disorder.<ref name="isbn92-832-2411-6">{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Haemo (World Health Organization Classification of Tumours S.) |publisher=Oxford Univ Pr |year=2003 |isbn=978-92-832-2411-2 }}</ref>

The [[International Myeloma Working Group]] (IMWG) has published criteria for the diagnosis of plasmacytomas.<ref name="pmid12780789">{{cite journal |author=International Myeloma Working Group |title=Criteria for the classification of monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma and related disorders: a report of the International Myeloma Working Group |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=749–57 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12780789 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04355.x|doi-access=free }}</ref> They recognise three distinct entities: SPB, extramedullary plasmacytoma and multiple solitary plasmacytomas (+/- recurrent). The proposed criteria for SPB is the presence of a single bone lesion, normal bone marrow (less than 5% plasma cells), small or no paraprotein, no related organ involvement/damage and a normal  [[skeletal survey]] (other than the single bone lesion). The criteria for extramedullary plasmacytoma are the same but the tumor is located in soft tissue. No bone lesions should be present. Criteria for multiple solitary plasmacytomas (+/- recurrent) are the same except either multiple solitary bone or soft tissue lesions must be present. They may occur as multiple primary tumors or as a recurrence from a previous plasmacytoma.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===Association with the Epstein–Barr virus===
Rarely, the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV) is associated with multiple myeloma and plasmacytomas, particularly in individuals who have an [[immunodeficiency]] due to e.g. [[HIV/AIDS]], [[organ transplantation]], or a chronic inflammatory condition such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name="pmid25973110">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sekiguchi Y, Shimada A, Ichikawa K, Wakabayashi M, Sugimoto K, Ikeda K, Sekikawa I, Tomita S, Izumi H, Nakamura N, Sawada T, Ohta Y, Komatsu N, Noguchi M | title = Epstein–Barr virus-positive multiple myeloma developing after immunosuppressant therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: a case report and review of literature | journal = International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 2090–102 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25973110 | pmc = 4396324 }}</ref> EBV-positive multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma are classified together by the World Health Organization (2016) as [[Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases]] and termed [[Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein-Barr virus-associated plasma cell myeloma|Epstein–Barr virus-associated plasma cell myeloma]]. EBV-positivity is more common in plasmacytoma than multiple myeloma. The tissues involved in EBV+ plasmacytoma typically show foci of EBV+ cells with the appearance of rapidly proliferating [[Plasma cell#Immature plasma cells|immature]] or [[Anaplasia|poorly differentiated]] plasma cells.<ref name="pmid29885408">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rezk SA, Zhao X, Weiss LM | title = Epstein - Barr virus - associated lymphoid proliferations, a 2018 update | journal = Human Pathology | volume = 79| pages = 18–41| date = June 2018 | pmid = 29885408 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2018.05.020 | s2cid = 47010934 }}</ref> These cells express products of EBV genes such as EBER1 and EBER2. EBV-positive plasmacytoma(s) is more likely to progress to multiple myeloma than EBV-negative plasmacytoma(s) suggesting that the virus may play a role in the progression of plasmacytoma to multiple myeloma.<ref name="pmid28325354">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan J, Wang J, Zhang W, Chen M, Chen J, Liu W | title = Solitary plasmacytoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus: a clinicopathologic, cytogenetic study and literature review | journal = Annals of Diagnostic Pathology | volume = 27 | pages = 1–6 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28325354 | doi = 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2016.09.002 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Radiotherapy]] is the main choice of treatment for both SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma, and local control rates of >80% can be achieved. This form of treatment can be used with curative intent because plasmacytoma is a [[radiosensitivity|radiosensitive]] tumor. [[Surgery]] is an option for extramedullary plasmacytoma, but for cosmetic reasons it is generally used when the lesion is not present within the head and neck region.<ref name="pmid16304406"/><ref name="pmid22654647"/><ref name ="2009plasmacytomaupdate"/> Another option is the possible combination of radiotherapy with anti-[[multiple myeloma]] treatment. In a study that included 68 patients, a group of 8 patients who were treated with radio- and chemotherapy (with or without surgery) were less likey to have a relapse of plasmacytoma, progress to multiple myeloma, or die compared with patients who were treated with radiotherapy and/or surgery alone [progression free survival (PFS), overall median: not reached vs. 48.0 months; respectively].<ref name="pmid36075048">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ganzel C, Trestman S, Levi S, et. al. |title=Clinical features, therapy patterns, outcomes and prognostic factors of solitary plasmacytomas: a report of the Israeli Myeloma Study Group |journal=Leuk Lymphoma |date=September 2022 |volume=63 |issue=14 |pages=3448–3455 |pmid=36075048 |doi=10.1080/10428194.2022.2118535|s2cid=252161148 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10428194.2022.2118535}}</ref> Concerning that study,<ref name="pmid36075048"/> a large prospective trial is needed to evaluate the impact of adding systemic anti-myeloma treatment to local radiotherapy.<ref name="pmid36075048"/>

==Prognosis==
Most cases of SPB progress to [[multiple myeloma]] within 2–4 years of diagnosis, but the overall median survival for SPB is 7–12 years. 30–50% of extramedullary plasmacytoma cases progress to multiple myeloma with a median time of 1.5–2.5 years. 15–45% of SPB and 50–65% of extramedullary plasmacytoma are disease free after 10 years.<ref name="pmid16304406"/>

==Epidemiology==
Plasmacytomas are a rare form of cancer. SPB is the most common form of the disease and accounts for 3-5% of all plasma cell malignancies. The median age at diagnosis for all plasmacytomas is 55. Both SPB and extramedullary plasmacytoma are more prevalent in males; with a 2:1 male to female ratio for SPB and a 3:1 ratio for extramedullary plasmacytoma.<ref name="pmid15009059">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Soutar R, Lucraft H, Jackson G, etal |title=Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of solitary plasmacytoma of bone and solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma |journal=Br.
