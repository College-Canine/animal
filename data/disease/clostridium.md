'''''Clostridium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[obligate anaerobe|anaerobic]], [[Gram-positive bacteria]]. Species of ''Clostridium'' inhabit soils and the intestinal tract of animals, including humans.<ref name="eom-clostridium">{{citation | first = Anne | last = Maczulak | name-list-style = vanc | entry=Clostridium | title=Encyclopedia of Microbiology | year=2011 | publisher=Facts on File | isbn=978-0-8160-7364-1 | pages=168–173}}</ref> This genus includes several significant human [[pathogen]]s, including the causative agents of [[botulism]] and [[tetanus]].

== History ==
In the late 1700s, Germany experienced several outbreaks of an illness connected to eating specific sausages. In 1817, the German neurologist [[Justinus Kerner]] detected rod-shaped cells in his investigations into this so-called sausage poisoning. In 1897, the Belgian biology professor [[Emile van Ermengem]] published his finding of an endospore-forming organism he isolated from spoiled ham. Biologists classified van Ermengem's discovery along with other known gram-positive spore formers in the genus ''[[Bacillus]]''. This classification presented problems, however, because the isolate grew only in anaerobic conditions, but ''Bacillus'' grew well in oxygen.<ref name="eom-clostridium" />

Circa 1880, in the course of studying [[fermentation]] and [[butyric acid]] synthesis, a scientist surnamed Prazmowski first assigned a binomial name to ''Clostridium butyricum''.<ref name="Newman_1904">{{Cite book |last=Newman |first=Sir George |title=Bacteriology and the Public Health |publisher=P. Blakiston's Son and Co. |year=1904 |isbn=9781345750270 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |pages=107–108}}</ref> The mechanisms of [[anaerobic respiration]] were still not yet well elucidated at that time, so taxonomy of anaerobes was still developing.<ref name="Newman_1904"/>

In 1924, [[Ida A. Bengtson]] separated van Ermengem's microorganisms from the ''Bacillus'' group and assigned them to the genus ''Clostridium''. By Bengtson's classification scheme, ''Clostridium'' contained all of the anaerobic endospore-forming rod-shaped bacteria, except the genus ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]''.<ref name="eom-clostridium" />

==Taxonomy==
{{Main|List of Clostridium species|l1=List of ''Clostridium'' species}}
As of October 2022, there are 164 validly published species in ''Clostridium''.<ref name=LPSN>Page ''Genus: Clostridium'' on {{cite web | url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/clostridium | title=LPSN - List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature | publisher=[[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen]] | access-date=2022-10-03}}</ref>

The genus, as traditionally defined, contains many organisms not closely related to its [[type species]]. The issue was originally illustrated in full detail by a [[rRNA]] phylogeny from Collins 1994, which split the traditional genus (now corresponding to a large slice of [[Clostridia]]) into twenty clusters, with cluster ''I'' containing the type species and its close relatives.<ref name="pmid7981107">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=MD |last2=Lawson |first2=PA |last3=Willems |first3=A |last4=Cordoba |first4=JJ |last5=Fernandez-Garayzabal |first5=J |last6=Garcia |first6=P |last7=Cai |first7=J |last8=Hippe |first8=H |last9=Farrow |first9=JA |title=The phylogeny of the genus Clostridium: proposal of five new genera and eleven new species combinations. |journal=International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology |date=October 1994 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=812–26 |doi=10.1099/00207713-44-4-812 |pmid=7981107 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Over the years, this has resulted in many new genera being split out, with the ultimate goal of constraining ''Clostridium'' to cluster ''I''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |first1=PA |last2=Rainey |first2=FA |title=Proposal to restrict the genus ''Clostridium'' Prazmowski to ''Clostridium butyricum'' and related species. |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |date=February 2016 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=1009–1016 |doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000824 |pmid=26643615 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Biochemistry==
Species of ''Clostridium'' are [[obligate anaerobe]] and capable of producing [[endospore]]s. They generally stain [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]], but as well as ''[[Bacillus]]'', are often described as Gram-variable, because they show an increasing number of gram-negative cells as the culture ages.<ref name="tfc">{{citation | first1 = Gerard J. | last1 = Tortora | first2 = Berdell R. | last2 = Funke | first3 = Christine L. | last3 = Case | name-list-style = vanc | title=Microbiology: An Introduction | edition=10th | publisher=Benjamin Cummings | year=2010 | pages=87, 134, 433 | isbn=978-0-321-55007-1}}</ref>
The normal, reproducing cells of ''Clostridium'', called the vegetative form, are [[Bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]], which gives them their name, from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] κλωστήρ or spindle. ''Clostridium'' endospores have a distinct bowling pin or bottle shape, distinguishing them from other bacterial endospores, which are usually ovoid in shape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} The [[Schaeffer–Fulton stain]] (0.5% [[malachite green]] in water) can be used to distinguish endospores of ''Bacillus'' and ''Clostridium'' from other microorganisms.<ref name="eom-stain">{{citation | first = Anne | last = Maczulak | name-list-style = vanc | entry=stain | title=Encyclopedia of Microbiology | year=2011 | publisher=Facts on File | isbn=978-0-8160-7364-1 | pages=726–729}}</ref>

''Clostridium'' can be differentiated from the also endospore forming genus ''Bacillus'' by its obligate anaerobic growth, the shape of endospores and the lack of [[catalase]]. Species of ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' form similar endospores and can be distinguished by their requirement for sulfur.<ref name="eom-clostridium" />
[[Glycolysis]] and [[fermentation]] of [[pyruvic acid]] by Clostridia yield the end products [[butyric acid]], [[butanol]], [[acetone]], [[isopropanol]], and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name="tfc" />

There is a commercially available [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) test kit (Bactotype) for the detection of ''C.&nbsp;perfringens'' and other pathogenic bacteria.<ref>{{citation | first1 = Hermann | last1 = Willems | first2 = Cornelie | last2 = Jäger | first3 = Gerald | last3 = Reiner | name-list-style = vanc | contribution=Polymerase Chain Reaction | title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–27 | doi=10.1002/14356007.c21_c01.pub2| title-link=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | isbn=978-3527306732 | s2cid = 86159965 }}</ref>

== Treatment ==
In general, the treatment of clostridial infection is high-dose [[penicillin G]], to which the organism has remained susceptible.<ref>{{citation | editor-first1 = Jerrold B. | editor-last1 = Leikin | editor-first2 = Frank P. | editor-last2 = Paloucek | name-list-style = vanc | entry=''Clostridium perfringens'' Poisoning | title=Poisoning and Toxicology Handbook | edition=4th | publisher=Informa | year=2008 | pages=892–893 | isbn=978-1-4200-4479-9}}</ref> ''[[Clostridium welchii]]'' and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' respond to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s.<ref>{{citation | first1 = Paul | last1 = Actor | first2 = Alfred W. | last2 = Chow | first3 = Frank J. | last3 = Dutko | first4 = Mark A. | last4 = McKinlay | name-list-style = vanc | contribution=Chemotherapeutics | title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–61 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a06_173| title-link=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | isbn=978-3527306732 }}</ref> Clostridia are also susceptible to [[tetracycline]]s, [[carbapenem]]s ([[imipenem]]), [[metronidazole]], [[vancomycin]], and [[chloramphenicol]].<ref>{{citation | editor-first = Richard A. | editor-last = Harvey | name-list-style = vanc | title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology | edition=5th | publisher=Lippincott | year=2012 | pages=389–404 | isbn=978-1-4511-1314-3}}</ref>

The vegetative cells of clostridia are heat-labile and are killed by short heating at temperatures above {{Convert|72-75|C}}. The thermal destruction of ''Clostridium'' spores requires higher temperatures (above {{Convert|121.1|C}}, for example in an [[autoclave]]) and longer cooking times (20&nbsp;min, with a few exceptional cases of more than 50&nbsp;min recorded in the literature). ''Clostridia'' and ''Bacilli'' are quite radiation-resistant, requiring doses of about 30&nbsp;kGy, which is a serious obstacle to the development of shelf-stable [[irradiated food]]s for general use in the retail market.<ref>{{citation | first = Pavel | last = Jelen | name-list-style = vanc | contribution=Foods, 2.

[[Fructooligosaccharide]]s ([[fructan]]s) such as [[inulin]], occurring in relatively large amounts in a number of foods such as [[chicory]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], [[leek]], [[artichoke]], and [[asparagus]], have a [[prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] or [[Bifidus factor|bifidogenic]] effect, selectively promoting the growth and metabolism of beneficial bacteria in the [[Large intestine|colon]], such as ''[[Bifidobacteria]]'' and [[Lactobacilli]], while inhibiting harmful ones, such as clostridia, [[fusobacteria]], and ''[[Bacteroides]]''.<ref>{{citation | first1 = Ralf | last1 = Zink | first2 = Andrea | last2 = Pfeifer | name-list-style = vanc | contribution=Health Value Added Foods | title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–12 | doi=10.1002/14356007.d12_d01| title-link=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | isbn=978-3527306732 }}</ref>

== Use ==
* ''[[Clostridium thermocellum]]'' can use lignocellulosic waste and generate ethanol, thus making it a possible candidate for use in production of [[ethanol fuel]]. It also has no oxygen requirement and is [[Thermophile|thermophilic]], which reduces cooling cost.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
* ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'' was first used by [[Chaim Weizmann]] to produce [[acetone]] and [[biobutanol]] from [[starch]] in 1916 for the production of [[cordite]] (smokeless gunpowder).{{cn|date=September 2022}}
* ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' produces a potentially lethal [[neurotoxin]] used in a diluted form in the drug [[Botox]], which is carefully injected to nerves in the face, which prevents the movement of the expressive muscles of the forehead, to delay the wrinkling effect of aging. It is also used to treat [[spasmodic torticollis]] and provides relief for around 12 to 16 weeks.<ref name=Velickovic1943 />
* ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]'' MIYAIRI 588 strain is marketed in Japan, Korea, and China for ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' prophylaxis due to its reported ability to interfere with the growth of the latter.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
* ''[[Clostridium histolyticum]]'' has been used as a source of the enzyme [[collagenase]], which degrades animal tissue. Clostridium species excrete collagenase to eat through tissue and, thus, help the pathogen spread throughout the body. The medical profession uses collagenase for the same reason in the [[débridement]] of infected wounds.<ref name="eom-clostridium" /> [[Hyaluronidase]], [[deoxyribonuclease]], [[lecithinase]], [[leukocidin]], [[protease]], [[lipase]], and [[hemolysin]] are also produced by some clostridia that cause gas gangrene.<ref name="tfc" /><ref>{{citation | editor-first = Gerard M. | editor-last = Doherty | name-list-style = vanc | chapter=Inflammation, Infection, & Antimicrobial Therapy | title=Current Diagnosis & Treatment: Surgery | year=2005 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn=978-0-07-159087-7}}</ref>
* ''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'', recently discovered in commercial chicken wastes, can produce ethanol from single-carbon sources including [[synthesis gas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]], that can be generated from the partial [[combustion]] of either [[fossil fuel]]s or [[biomass]].<ref name=B.Resources />
* ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]'' converts [[glycerol]] to [[1,3-propanediol]].<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Saint-Amans S, Perlot P, Goma G, Soucaille P |url=https://www.academia.edu/13860932 |title=High production of 1,3-propanediol from gycerol by ''clostridium butyricum'' VPI 3266 in a simply controlled fed-batch system |date=August 1994 |journal=Biotechnology Letters |volume=16 |number=8 |pages=831–836 |doi=10.1007/BF00133962 |s2cid=2896050 }}</ref>
* Genes from ''[[Clostridium thermocellum]]'' have been inserted into [[transgenic]] mice to allow the production of [[endoglucanase]]. The experiment was intended to learn more about how the digestive capacity of [[monogastric]] animals could be improved. {{cn|date=February 2023}}<!-- Hall ''et al.'' published their findings in 1993. -->
* Nonpathogenic strains of ''Clostridium'' may help in the treatment of diseases such as [[cancer]]. Research shows that ''Clostridium'' can selectively target cancer cells. Some strains can enter and replicate within solid [[tumor]]s. ''Clostridium'' could, therefore, be used to deliver therapeutic proteins to tumours. This use of ''Clostridium'' has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.<ref name=Mengesha2009 />
* Mixtures of ''Clostridium'' species, such as ''[[Clostridium beijerinckii]]'', ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]'', and species from other genera have been shown to produce [[biohydrogen]] from [[yeast]] waste.<ref name=Chou2011 />
