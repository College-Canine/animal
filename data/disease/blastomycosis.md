Blastomycosis has existed for millions of years but was first described by [[Thomas Caspar Gilchrist]] in 1894. Because of this, it is sometimes called "Gilchrist's disease".<ref name=Gilchrist>{{cite book | last1 = Crissey | first1 = John Thorne | last2 = Parish | first2 = Lawrence C. | last3 = Holubar | first3 = Karl  | title = Historical Atlas of Dermatology and Dermatologists | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7ThZDwAAQBAJ&q=Thomas+Casper+Gilchrist&pg=PA86 | year = 2002 | publisher = Parthenon Publishing Group | pages = 86 | isbn = 978-1842141007 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:An introduction to dermatology (1905) blastomycosis.jpg|thumb|Skin lesions caused by blastomycosis.]]
The symptoms of blastomycosis cover a wide range, overlapping with more common conditions; for this reason, blastomycosis has often been called "the great pretender".<ref name="mcbride2017"/> Many cases are [[asymptomatic]] or subclinical. Lung symptoms are common, because the lungs are infected in 79% of blastomycosis cases.<ref name="mcbride2017"/> However, in 25-40% of cases the disease also disseminates to other organs, including the skin.<ref name="mcbride2017"/>

The extent and severity of symptoms depends in part on a person's immune status; less than 50% of healthy people with blastomycosis have symptoms, while immunocompromised patients are especially likely to have the disease spread beyond the lungs to other organs like the skin and bones.<ref name="Murray 2015">{{cite book | vauthors = Murray P, Rosenthal K, Pfaller M | year = 2015 | chapter = Chapter 64: Systemic Mycoses Caused by Dimorphic Fungi | title = Medical Microbiology | edition = 8 | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 629–633 | isbn = 978-0323299565 }}</ref>

Blastomycosis manifests as a primary [[lung]] infection in about 79% of cases.<ref name="mcbride2017"/> The onset is relatively slow and symptoms are suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, often leading to initial treatment with antibacterials. Because the symptoms are variable and nonspecific, blastomycosis is often not even considered in [[differential diagnosis]] until antibacterial treatment has failed, unless there are known risk factors or skin lesions.<ref name="mcbride2017"/> The disease may be misdiagnosed as a carcinoma, leading in some cases to surgical removal of the affected tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Upper lung lobes are involved somewhat more frequently than lower lobes.<ref name=kwonchung1992/> If untreated, many cases progress over a period of months to years to become disseminated blastomycosis.

Blastomycosis in the lungs may present a variety of symptoms, or no symptoms at all.<ref name="mcbride2017"/> If symptoms are present they may range from mild [[pneumonia]] resembling a [[pneumococcal]] infection to [[ARDS|acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)]].<ref name="mcbride2017"/> Common symptoms include fever, chills, headache, coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain, and malaise.<ref name="mcbride2017"/> Without treatment, cases may progress to chronic pneumonia or ARDS.<ref name="mcbride2017"/>

ARDS is an uncommon but dangerous manifestation of blastomycosis. It was seen in 9 of 72 blastomycosis cases studied in northeast Tennessee.<ref name="vasquez1998"/> Such cases may follow massive exposure, such during brush clearing operations. In the Tennessee study, the fatality rate was 89% in the ARDS cases, but only 10% in the non-ARDS cases.<ref name="vasquez1998"/>

In disseminated blastomycosis, the large Blastomyces yeast cells translocate from the lungs and are trapped in capillary beds elsewhere in the body, where they cause lesions. The skin is the most common organ affected, being the site of lesions in approximately 60% of cases.<ref name=kwonchung1992/> The signature image of blastomycosis in textbooks is the [[Indolent condition|indolent]], verrucous or ulcerated dermal lesion seen in disseminated disease. [[Osteomyelitis]] is also common (12–60% of cases). Other recurring sites of dissemination are the genitourinary tract (kidney, prostate, epididymis; collectively ca. 25% of cases) and the brain (3–10% of cases).<ref name=kwonchung1992/> 40% of immunocompromised individuals have [[Central nervous system|CNS]] involvement and present as [[brain abscess]], epidural abscess or [[meningitis]].

Blastomycosis in non-lung organs such as the skin may present a very wide range of symptoms, including the following:
* skin lesions, which may be verrucous (wart-like) or ulcerated with small pustules at the margins.
* bone or joint pain due to bone lytic lesions.
* pain when urinating due to [[prostatitis]].
* hoarseness due to [[larynx|laryngeal]] involvement.
* headache, confusion or other neurological symptoms caused by [[central nervous system]] involvement.

==Cause==

Blastomycosis is caused by [[Dimorphic fungus|dimorphic fungi]] in the genus ''Blastomyces'', in the phylum [[Ascomycota]] and family [[Ajellomycetaceae]]. In eastern North America, the most common cause of blastomycosis is ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'', but ''[[Blastomyces gilchristii]]'' has been associated with some outbreaks. In western North America, many cases of blastomycosis are caused by ''[[Blastomyces helicus]]'', which most commonly attacks immunodeficient people and domestic animals. The species ''[[Blastomyces percursus]]'' causes many cases of blastomycosis in Africa and the Middle East.<ref name="schwartz2021">{{Cite journal

In endemic areas, ''Blastomyces dermatitidis'' lives in soil and rotten wood near lakes and rivers. Although it has never been directly observed growing in nature, it is thought to grow there as a cottony white mold, similar to the growth seen in artificial culture at 25&nbsp;°C. The moist, acidic soil in the surrounding woodland harbors the fungus.

==Pathogenesis==
[[Image:Blastomyces dermatitidis GMS.jpeg|thumb|Large, broadly-based budding yeast cells characteristic of ''Blastomyces dermatitidis'' in a GMS-stained biopsy section from a human leg.]]

Inhaled conidia of ''Blastomyces'' are [[phagocytosed]] by neutrophils and macrophages in alveoli. Some of these escape phagocytosis and transform into yeast phase rapidly. Having thick walls, these are resistant to phagocytosis. Once they have transitioned to the yeast phase, the ''Blastomyces'' cells express the protein ''BAD-1'', which helps the yeast cells attach to host cells, and also impairs activation of immune cells while inhibiting release of [[tumor necrosis factor]].

Once suspected, the diagnosis of blastomycosis can usually be confirmed by demonstration of the characteristic broad based budding organisms in sputum or tissues by KOH prep, cytology, or histology.<ref name="veligandla2002"/> Tissue biopsy of skin or other organs may be required in order to diagnose extra-pulmonary disease. Blastomycosis is histologically associated with granulomatous nodules.

Commercially available urine antigen testing appears to be quite sensitive in suggesting the diagnosis in cases where the organism is not readily detected.<ref name="nel2018"/> However, commercial antigen tests have a high degree of [[cross-reactivity]] with other endemic fungal conditions such as [[histoplasmosis]], and thus cannot distinguish blastomycosis from other similar conditions.<ref name="nel2018"/><ref name="linder2021">{{Cite journal

Among azole drugs, [[itraconazole]] is generally the treatment of choice. [[Voriconazole]] is often recommended for CNS blastomycosis cases due to its ability to pass the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="idsa2008"/> Other azole drugs that may be used include [[fluconazole]]. [[Ketoconazole]] was the azole drug first used for blastomycosis treatment, but has been largely replaced by itraconazole because ketoconazole is less effective and less tolerated by patients.<ref name="idsa2008"/> The azole treatment generally lasts for a minimum of six months. Cure rates from itraconazole treatment are nearly 95%.<ref name="idsa2008"/> [[Relapse]] is rare but does occur even after a full course of treatment.<ref name="idsa2008"/>

Incidence in most endemic areas is about 0.5 per 100,000 population, with occasional local areas attaining as high as 12 per 100,000.<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=rippon1988/><ref name=manetti1991/><ref name=cano2003/> Most Canadian data fit this picture. In Ontario, Canada, considering both endemic and non-endemic areas, the overall incidence is around 0.3 cases per 100,000; northern Ontario, mostly endemic, has 2.44 per 100,000.<ref name=morris2006/> [[Manitoba]] is calculated at 0.62 cases per 100,000.<ref name=crampton2002/> Remarkably higher incidence was shown for the [[Kenora, Ontario]] region: 117 per 100,000 overall, with aboriginal reserve communities experiencing 404.9 per 100,000.<ref name=dwight2000/> In the United States, the incidence of blastomycosis is similarly high in hyperendemic areas. For example, the city of Eagle River, Vilas County, Wisconsin, which has an incidence rate of 101.3 per 100,000; the county as a whole has been shown in two successive studies to have an incidence of about 40 cases per 100,000.<ref name=baumgardner1998/> An incidence of 277 per 100,000 was roughly calculated based on 9 cases seen in a Wisconsin aboriginal reservation during a time in which extensive excavation was done for new housing construction.<ref name=baumgardner2002/> The new case rates are greater in northern states such as [[Wisconsin]], where from 1986 to 1995 there were 1.4 cases per 100,000 people.<ref name=mmwr1996/>

The study of outbreaks as well as trends in individual cases of blastomycosis has clarified a number of important matters. Some of these relate to the ongoing effort to understand the source of infectious inoculum of this species, while others relate to which groups of people are especially likely to become infected. Human blastomycosis is primarily associated with forested areas and open watersheds;<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=disalvo1992/><ref name=baumgardner2005a/><ref name=baumgardner2006/> It primarily affects otherwise healthy, vigorous people, mostly middle-aged,<ref name=klein1987/> who acquire the disease while working or undertaking recreational activities in sites conventionally considered clean, healthy and in many cases beautiful.<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=rippon1988/> Repeatedly associated activities include hunting, especially raccoon hunting,<ref name=armstrong1987/> where accompanying dogs also tend to be affected, as well as working with wood or plant material in forested or riparian areas,<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=kesselman2005/> involvement in forestry in highly endemic areas,<ref name=vaaler1990/> excavation,<ref name=baumgardner1998/> fishing<ref name=klein1987/><ref name=baumgardner1992/> and possibly gardening and trapping.<ref name=dwight2000/><ref name=baumgardner1998/>

===Urban infections===
There is also a developing profile of urban and other domestic blastomycosis cases, beginning with an outbreak tentatively attributed to [[construction dust]] in [[Westmont, Illinois]].<ref name=kitchen1977/> The city of [[Rockford, Illinois]], was also documented as a hyperendemic area based on incidence rates as high as 6.67 per 100,000 population for some areas of the city. Though proximity to open watersheds was linked to incidence in some areas,<ref name=baumgardner2006/> suggesting that outdoor activity within the city may be connected to many cases, there is also an increasing body of evidence that even the interiors of buildings may be risk areas. An early case concerned a prisoner who was confined to prison during the whole of his likely blastomycotic incubation period.<ref name=renston1992/> An epidemiological survey found that although many patients who contracted blastomycosis had engaged in fishing, hunting, gardening, outdoor work and excavation, the most strongly linked association in patients was living or visiting near waterways.<ref name=baumgardner1992/> Based on a similar finding in a Louisiana study, it has been suggested that place of residence might be the most important single factor in blastomycosis epidemiology in north central [[Wisconsin]].<ref name=lowry1989/> Follow-up epidemiological and case studies indicated that clusters of cases were often associated with particular domiciles, often spread out over a period of years, and that there were uncommon but regularly occurring cases in which pets kept mostly or entirely indoors, in particular cats, contracted blastomycosis.<ref name=blondin2007/><ref name=baumgardner2001/> The occurrence of blastomycosis, then, is an issue strongly linked to housing and domestic circumstances.

===Seasonal trends===
Seasonality and weather also appear to be linked to contraction of blastomycosis. Many studies have suggested an association between blastomycosis contraction and cool to moderately warm, moist periods of the spring and autumn<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=dwight2000/><ref name=rudmann1992/> or, in relatively warm winter areas.<ref name=arceneaux1998/> However, the entire summer or a known summer exposure date is included in the association in some studies.<ref name=klein1987/><ref name=archer1987/> Occasional studies fail to detect a seasonal link.<ref name=chapman1997/> In terms of weather, both unusually dry weather<ref name=proctor2002/> and unusually moist weather<ref name=degroote2000/> have been cited. The seemingly contradictory data can most likely be reconciled by proposing that ''B. dermatitidis'' prospers in its natural habitats in times of moisture and moderate warmth, but that inoculum formed during these periods remains alive for some time and can be released into the air by subsequent dust formation under dry conditions. Indeed, dust per se or construction potentially linked to dust has been associated with several outbreaks<ref name=vasquez1998/><ref name=kitchen1977/><ref name=baumgardner1991/> The data, then, tend to link blastomycosis to all weather, climate and atmospheric conditions except freezing weather, periods of snow cover, and extended periods of hot, dry summer weather in which soil is not agitated.

===Gender bias===
Sex is another factor inconstantly linked to contraction of blastomycosis: though many studies show more men than women affected,<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=morris2006/> some show no sex-related bias.<ref name=dwight2000/><ref name=baumgardner1992/> As mentioned above, most cases are in middle aged adults, but all age groups are affected, and cases in children are not uncommon.<ref name=kwonchung1992/><ref name=dwight2000/><ref name=morris2006/>

=== Ethnic populations ===

Ethnic group or race is frequently investigated in epidemiological studies of blastomycosis, but is potentially confounded by differences in residence and in quality and accessibility of medical care, factors that have not been stringently controlled for to date. In the United States, some studies show a disproportionately high incidence and/or mortality rate for blastomycosis among [[Black people]].<ref name=manetti1991/><ref name=cano2003/><ref name=dworkin2005/><ref name=lemos2000/>

In Canada, some studies, but not others,<ref name=crampton2002/> indicate that [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations people]] have a disproportionately high incidence of blastomycosis.<ref name=dwight2000/><ref name=kepron1972/> Incidence in First Nations children may be unusually high.<ref name=dwight2000/> The Canadian data in some areas may be confounded or explained by the tendency to establish indigenous communities in wooded, riparian, northern areas corresponding to the core habitat of ''B. dermatitidis'', often with known ''B. dermatitidis'' habitats such as woodpiles and beaver constructions in the near vicinity.

===Communicability===
Blastomycosis is not considered contagious, either among humans or between animals and humans.<ref name="Prevention"/> However, there are a very small number of cases of human-to-human transmission of ''B. dermatitidis'' related to dermal contact<ref name=bachir2006/> or sexual transmission of disseminated blastomycosis of the genital tract among spouses.<ref name=kwonchung1992/>

At the [[Koster Site]] in Illinois, evidence pointing to possible blastomycosis infections among [[Woodland period|Late Woodland]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] has been identified. At that site, [[Jane E. Buikstra|Dr. Jane Buikstra]] found evidence for what may have been an epidemic of a serious spinal disease in adolescents and young adults. Several of the skeletons showed lesions in the spinal vertebrae in the lower back. There are two modern diseases that produce lesions in the bone similar to the ones Dr. Buikstra found in these prehistoric specimens: [[Pott disease|spinal TB]] and blastomycosis. The bony lesions in these two diseases are practically identical. Blastomycosis seems more probable as these young people in Late Woodland and Mississippian times may have been affected because they were spending more time cultivating plants than their Middle Woodland predecessors had done. If true, it would be another severe penalty Late Woodland people had to pay as they shifted to agriculture as a way of life, and it would be a contributing factor to shortening their lifespans compared to those of the Middle Woodland people.<ref>Struever, Stuart and Felicia Antonelli Holton (1979).

Blastomycosis was first described by [[Thomas Caspar Gilchrist]] in 1894, as a skin disease. Because of this, blastomycosis is sometimes called "Gilchrist's disease".<ref name=Gilchrist/> Gilchrist initially identified the cause of the disease as a [[protozoan]], but later correctly identified it as a fungus.<ref name="espinelingroff1996">{{Cite book

The systemic spread of blastomycosis was first described in 1902, in a case that had been misdiagnosed as a combination of tuberculosis and a blastomycosis skin infection. In 1907, the [[dimorphic fungus|dimorphic]] nature of the ''Blastomyces'' fungus was first identified.<ref name="espinelingroff1996"/> In 1912, the first case of canine blastomycosis was reported.<ref name="schwartz2018"/>

Prior to the 1930s, blastomycosis was not clearly distinguished from similar fungal conditions.<ref name="espinelingroff1996"/> A paper by [[Rhoda Williams Benham]] in 1934 distinguished the causative agent of blastomycosis from [[cryptococcosis]] and [[coccidioidomycosis]].<ref name="espinelingroff1996"/>

In the early 1950s, blastomycosis was first determined to be a primarily respiratory disease, with most skin lesions caused by systemic spread from an initial lung infection.<ref>{{Cite book

Prior to 2013, the only species known to cause blastomycosis was ''B. dermatitidis''. Since that time, genomic analysis has identified multiple other ''Blastomyces'' species causing blastomycosis, including ''B. gilchristii'' (2013), ''B. helicus'' (reassigned from the genus ''[[Emmonsia]]'' in 2017), ''B. percursus'' (2017), and ''B. emzantsi'' (2020).<ref name="klein2021"/>
