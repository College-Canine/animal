'''Rabies''' is a [[viral disease]] that causes [[encephalitis]] in humans and other [[mammals]].<ref name="WHO2013" /> It was historically referred to as '''hydrophobia''' ("fear of water") due to the symptom of panic when presented with liquids to drink. Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure.<ref name="WHO2013" /> These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and [[loss of consciousness]].<ref name="WHO2013" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Rabies, Symptoms, Causes, Treatment |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/181980 |work=Medical News Today |date=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rabies, Symptoms and causes |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821 |work=Mayo Clinic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Animal bites and rabies |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/animal-bites-and-rabies |work=Johns Hopkins Medicine |date=27 February 2020}}</ref> Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death.<ref name="WHO2013" /> The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year.<ref name="WHO2013" /> The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]] to reach the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book |vauthors=Cotran RS, Kumar V, Fausto N |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |year=2005 |page=1375 |isbn=978-0-7216-0187-8}}</ref>

The [[Incubation period|period]] between infection and the first [[Influenza-like illness|symptoms]] (incubation period) is typically one to three months in humans.<ref name="Giesen2015" /> This period may be as short as four days or longer than six years, depending on the location and severity of the wound and the amount of virus introduced.<ref name="Giesen2015" /> Initial symptoms of rabies are often nonspecific such as fever and headache.<ref name="Giesen2015">{{cite journal |vauthors=Giesen A, Gniel D, Malerczyk C |title=30 Years of rabies vaccination with Rabipur: a summary of clinical data and global experience |journal=Expert Review of Vaccines |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=351–67 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25683583 |doi=10.1586/14760584.2015.1011134 |type=Review |doi-access=free}}</ref> As rabies progresses and causes [[meningoencephalitis|inflammation of the brain and meninges]], symptoms can include slight or partial [[paralysis]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[confusion]], [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]], abnormal behavior, [[paranoia]], [[Fear|terror]], and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="Robbins" /><ref name="Giesen2015" /> The person may also have fear of water.<ref name="WHO2013" />

[[File:Hydrophobia in rabies.webm|thumb|Man with rabies displaying hydrophobia]]

Rabies has also occasionally been referred to as hydrophobia ("fear of water") throughout its history.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Cliff AD, Haggett P, Smallman-Raynor M |title=World atlas of epidemic diseases |date=2004 |publisher=Arnold |location=London |isbn=978-0-340-76171-7 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNVCiNnGVvsC&pg=PA51}}</ref> It refers to a set of symptoms in the later stages of an infection in which the person has difficulty swallowing, shows panic when presented with liquids to drink, and cannot quench their thirst. Saliva production is greatly increased, and attempts to drink, or even the intention or suggestion of drinking, may cause excruciatingly painful spasms of the muscles in the throat and [[larynx]]. Since the infected individual cannot swallow saliva and water, the virus has a much higher chance of being transmitted, because it multiplies and accumulates in the [[salivary gland]]s and is transmitted through biting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animalswecare.com/home_section/rabies/ |website=AnimalsWeCare.com |title=Rabies |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903193928/http://www.animalswecare.com/home_section/rabies/ |archive-date=3 September 2014}}</ref>

Hydrophobia is commonly associated with furious rabies, which affects 80% of rabies-infected people. This form of rabies causes irrational aggression in the host, which aids in the spreading of the virus through animal bites;<ref>{{cite web |title=How does rabies cause aggression? |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319735#Virus-interacts-with-muscle-receptors |website=medicalnewstoday.com |date=14 October 2017 |publisher=Medical News Today |access-date=19 January 2023}}</ref>{{medical citation needed|date=December 2023}} a "foaming at the mouth" effect, caused by the accumulation of saliva, is also commonly associated with rabies in the public perception and in popular culture.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Wilson PJ, Rohde RE, Oertli EH, Willoughby Jr RE |date=2019 |title=Rabies: Clinical Considerations and Exposure Evaluations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnWODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28|edition=1st|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|page=28|isbn=978-0-323-63979-8|access-date=May 10, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabiesandkids/amy.html|title=How Do You Know if an Animal Has Rabies? {{!}} CDC Rabies and Kids|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)|access-date=May 10, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/rabies.html|title=Rabies (for Parents)|website=KidsHealth.org|publisher=[[Nemours KidsHealth]]|access-date=May 10, 2023}}</ref> The remaining 20% may experience a paralytic form of rabies that is marked by muscle [[Muscle weakness|weakness]], loss of sensation, and [[paralysis]]; this form of rabies does not usually cause fear of water.<ref name="NHS">{{cite web |title=Symptoms of rabies |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rabies/Pages/Symptoms.aspx |website=NHS.uk |access-date=3 September 2014 |date=12 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914174652/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Rabies/Pages/Symptoms.aspx |archive-date=14 September 2014}}</ref>

Rabies is caused by a number of [[lyssavirus]]es including the [[rabies virus]] and [[Australian bat lyssavirus]].<ref name="Au2014" /> [[Duvenhage lyssavirus]] may cause a rabies-like infection.<ref name="Thiel2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=van Thiel PP, de Bie RM, Eftimov F, Tepaske R, Zaaijer HL, van Doornum GJ, Schutten M, Osterhaus AD, Majoie CB, Aronica E, Fehlner-Gardiner C, Wandeler AI, Kager PA |display-authors=6 |title=Fatal human rabies due to Duvenhage virus from a bat in Kenya: failure of treatment with coma-induction, ketamine, and antiviral drugs |journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e428 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19636367 |pmc=2710506 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000428 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The rabies virus is the [[type species]] of the ''[[Lyssavirus]]'' [[genus]], in the family'' [[Rhabdoviridae]]'', order ''[[Mononegavirales]]''. Lyssavirions have helical symmetry, with a length of about 180&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] and a cross-section of about 75&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Sherris">{{cite book |vauthors=Drew WL |chapter=Chapter 41: Rabies | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |pages=597–600 |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0}}</ref> These virions are [[Viral envelope|enveloped]] and have a single-stranded [[RNA]] genome with [[negative-sense#Negative-sense|negative sense]]. The genetic information is packed as a [[ribonucleoprotein]] complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein. The [[RNA genome]] of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and the viral RNA polymerase (L).<ref name="pmid15885837">{{cite journal |vauthors=Finke S, Conzelmann KK |title=Replication strategies of rabies virus |journal=Virus Research |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=120–31 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15885837 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2005.04.004}}</ref>

To enter cells, trimeric spikes on the exterior of the membrane of the virus interact with a specific cell receptor, the most likely one being the [[acetylcholine]] receptor. The cellular membrane pinches in a procession known as [[pinocytosis]] and allows entry of the virus into the cell by way of an [[endosome]]. The virus then uses the acidic environment, which is necessary, of that endosome and binds to its membrane simultaneously, releasing its five proteins and single-strand RNA into the cytoplasm.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP" />

Once within a muscle or nerve cell, the virus undergoes replication. The L protein then transcribes five mRNA strands and a positive strand of RNA all from the original negative strand RNA using free nucleotides in the cytoplasm. These five mRNA strands are then translated into their corresponding proteins (P, L, N, G and M proteins) at free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Some proteins require post-translational modifications. For example, the G protein travels through the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where it undergoes further folding, and is then transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], where a sugar group is added to it ([[glycosylation]]).<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP" />

When there are enough viral proteins, the viral polymerase will begin to synthesize new negative strands of RNA from the template of the positive-strand RNA. These negative strands will then form complexes with the N, P, L and M proteins and then travel to the inner membrane of the cell, where a G protein has embedded itself in the membrane. The G protein then coils around the N-P-L-M complex of proteins taking some of the host cell membrane with it, which will form the new outer envelope of the virus particle. The virus then buds from the cell.<ref name="CDC_Rabies_PEP" />

From the point of entry, the virus is [[neurotropic virus|neurotropic]], traveling along the neural pathways into the [[central nervous system]]. The virus usually first infects muscle cells close to the site of infection, where they are able to replicate without being 'noticed' by the host's immune system. Once enough virus has been replicated, they begin to bind to [[acetylcholine receptor]]s at the neuromuscular junction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gluska S, Zahavi EE, Chein M, Gradus T, Bauer A, Finke S, Perlson E |title=Rabies Virus Hijacks and accelerates the p75NTR retrograde axonal transport machinery |journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]] |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=e1004348 |date=August 2014 |pmid=25165859 |pmc=4148448 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004348 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The virus then travels through the nerve cell axon via [[Axonal transport#Retrograde transport|retrograde transport]], as its [[P protein]] interacts with [[dynein]], a protein present in the cytoplasm of nerve cells. Once the virus reaches the cell body it travels rapidly to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), replicating in motor neurons and eventually reaching the brain.<ref name="Robbins" /> After the brain is infected, the virus travels centrifugally to the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, eventually migrating to the salivary glands, where it is ready to be transmitted to the next host.<ref name="Baer1991" />{{rp|317}}

Although it is theoretically possible for rabies-infected humans to transmit it to others by biting or otherwise, no such cases have ever been documented, because infected humans are usually hospitalized and necessary precautions taken. Casual contact, such as touching a person with rabies or contact with non-infectious fluid or tissue (urine, blood, feces), does not constitute an exposure and does not require post-exposure prophylaxis. But as the virus is present in sperm and vaginal secretions, it might be possible for rabies to spread through sex.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rabies FAQs: Exposure, prevention and treatment | url = https://rabiesalliance.org/rabies/what-is-rabies-and-frequently-asked-questions/exposure-prevention-treatment | work = RabiesAlliance.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160924072630/https://rabiesalliance.org/rabies/what-is-rabies-and-frequently-asked-questions/exposure-prevention-treatment | archive-date = 24 September 2016 }}</ref> There are only a small number of recorded cases of human-to-human transmission of rabies, and all occurred through [[organ transplant]]s, most frequently with [[corneal transplantation]], from infected donors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan A, Burton EC, Kuehnert MJ, Rupprecht C, Sutker WL, Ksiazek TG, Paddock CD, Guarner J, Shieh WJ, Goldsmith C, Hanlon CA, Zoretic J, Fischbach B, Niezgoda M, El-Feky WH, Orciari L, Sanchez EQ, Likos A, Klintmalm GB, Cardo D, LeDuc J, Chamberland ME, Jernigan DB, Zaki SR | display-authors = 6 | title = Transmission of rabies virus from an organ donor to four transplant recipients | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 11 | pages = 1103–11 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15784663 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa043018 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Human Rabies Prevention --- United States, 2008 Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices | website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=2008-05-23 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5703a1.htm | access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>

In Asia and in parts of the Americas and Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, pets may not be privately kept and their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, a practice that has successfully reduced rabies in rural areas of [[Canada]], [[France]], and the [[United States]]. In [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, baits are successfully used on raccoons in the Mount-Royal Park area. Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, but cost-benefit analysis suggests baits may be a cost-effective method of control.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meltzer MI |title=Assessing the costs and benefits of an oral vaccine for raccoon rabies: a possible model |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=343–9 |date=October–December 1996 |pmid=8969251 |pmc=2639934 |doi=10.3201/eid0204.960411}}</ref> In [[Ontario]], a dramatic drop in rabies was recorded when an aerial bait-vaccination campaign was launched.<ref name=Grambo>{{cite book | vauthors = Grambo RL |title=The World of the Fox |year=1995 |publisher=Greystone Books |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-87156-377-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldoffox00gram/page/94 94–5] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/worldoffox00gram/page/94}}</ref>

Thailand has the resources and medicine necessary to tackle rabies such as implementing regulations that require all children to receive a rabies vaccination before attending schools and having clinics available for those bit or scratched by a possible rabid animal. However, it is up to the individual to take themselves to the clinic, and 10 people per year die due to their own refusal.<ref>CDC. (2024) Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

===== Cambodia =====
Cambodia has about 800 cases of human rabies per year making Cambodia one of the top countries in human rabies incidences.<ref>Baron N., Chevalier V.,Sowath L. ,Veasna D. ,Dussart P.,Fontenille D.,Peng Y.S.,Martínez-López B. (2022).Accessibility to rabies centers and human rabies post-exposure prophylaxis rates in Cambodia: A Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis to identify optimal locations for future centers. PLOS.Neglected Tropical Diseases https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010494 </ref> Much of this falls on their lack of animal care, Cambodia has hundreds of thousands of animals infected with rabies, another global high, yet little surveillance of said animals and few laws requiring pets and other household animals to be vaccinated. (Baron N., Chevalier V.,Sowath L. et al(2022). What's striking about this is Cambodia’s national net worth, they are considered a wealthy nation with the funds capable of combating rabies and vaccinating all consenting citizens. In recent years [[Cambodia]] has improved significantly in their human rabies medical practices, with clinics all over the countries being made with treatments and vaccination on hand as well as rabies related education in school classes.<ref>Center for Disease Control.(2024)Travelers' Health.

==History==
Rabies has been known since around 2000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adamson PB | title = The spread of rabies into Europe and the probable origin of this disease in antiquity | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland.

Rabies appears to have originated in the Old World, the first [[epizootic]] in the New World occurring in Boston in 1768.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Baer GM | title = The Natural History of Rabies | edition = 2nd | publisher = CRC Press | date = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-8493-6760-1 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=dw8qW6jcfWUC&q=history+of+rabies&pg=PA1 | quote = The first major epizootic in North America was reported in 1768, continuing until 1771 when foxes and dogs carried the disease to swine and domestic animals.

Rabies was considered a scourge for its prevalence in the 19th century. In France and Belgium, where [[Hubertus|Saint Hubert]] was venerated, the "[[St Hubert's Key]]" was heated and applied to cauterize the wound. By an application of [[magical thinking]], dogs were branded with the key in hopes of protecting them from rabies.

It was not uncommon for a person bitten by a dog merely suspected of being rabid to commit suicide or to be killed by others.<ref name="Rotivel"/>

In ancient times the attachment of the tongue (the [[lingual frenulum]], a mucous membrane) was cut and removed, as this was where rabies was thought to originate. This practice ceased with the discovery of the actual cause of rabies.<ref name="Baer1991">{{cite book| vauthors = Baer G |title=The Natural History of Rabies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw8qW6jcfWUC&q=rabies+history&pg=PA1|publisher=CRC Press|access-date=31 October 2011|isbn=978-0-8493-6760-1|year=1991}}</ref> Louis Pasteur's 1885 nerve tissue vaccine was successful, and was progressively improved to reduce often severe side-effects.<ref name=Giesen2015/>

In modern times, the fear of rabies has not diminished, and the disease and its symptoms, particularly agitation, have served as an [[Rabies in popular culture|inspiration for several works]] of [[zombie]] or similarly themed fiction, often portraying rabies as having mutated into a stronger virus which fills humans with murderous rage or incurable illness, bringing about a devastating, widespread pandemic.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Than K |title='Zombie Virus' Possible via Rabies-Flu Hybrid? |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/1001027-rabies-influenza-zombie-virus-science/ |website=National Geographic |access-date=13 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913232030/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/1001027-rabies-influenza-zombie-virus-science/ |archive-date=13 September 2015 |date=27 October 2010 }}</ref>

Rabies is infectious to [[mammal]]s; three stages of central nervous system infection are recognized. The clinical course is often shorter in animals than in humans, but result in similar symptoms and almost always death. The first stage is a one- to three-day period characterized by behavioral changes and is known as the [[Prodrome|prodromal stage]]. The second is the excitative stage, which lasts three to four days. This stage is often known as "furious rabies" for the tendency of the affected animal to be hyper-reactive to external stimuli and bite or attack anything near. In some cases, animals skip the excitative stage and develop paralysis, as in the third phase; the paralytic phase. This stage develops due to damage to [[motor neuron]]s. Incoordination is seen, owing to rear limb [[paralysis]], and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. Death is usually caused by [[respiratory arrest]].<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book| vauthors = Ettinger SJ, Feldman EC |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.
