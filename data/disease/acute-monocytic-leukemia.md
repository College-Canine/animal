'''Acute monocytic leukemia''' ('''AMoL''', or '''AML-M5''')<ref name="urlAcute Myeloid Leukemia - Signs and Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/leukemia/conditions/aml/signs.html |title=Acute Myeloid Leukemia – Signs and Symptoms }}</ref> is a type of [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. In AML-M5 >80% of the leukemic cells are of monocytic lineage.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Acute Monocytic Leukemia – an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-monocytic-leukemia|access-date=2021-03-06|website=www.sciencedirect.com}}</ref> This cancer is characterized by a dominance of [[monocyte]]s in the bone marrow. There is an overproduction of monocytes that the body does not need in the periphery. These overproduced monocytes interfere with normal immune cell production which causes many health complications for the affected individual.

==Causes==
The pathology of AML involves abnormal proliferation and differentiation of a population of myeloid stem cells. Genetic [[mutation]]s are identified in the majority of cases. A common genetic mutation identified in these cases are characterized as chromosomal [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]] where information from one [[chromosome]] is exchanged to a non-homologous chromosome creating an unusual rearrangement of chromosomes. This translocation is often abbreviated as t(#of one chromosome involved, #of other chromosome involved). M5 is associated with characteristic [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]], often involving [[chromosome 11 (human)|chromosome 11]], such as t(9;11), affecting the [[MLL (gene)|MLL]] (KMTA2) locus at 11q23; however MLL translocations are also found in other leukemia subtypes. The t(8;16) translocation in AMoL is associated with [[hemophagocytosis]]. These translocations yield the formation of chimeric proteins (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and PML-RARA, respectively) which disrupt normal myeloid precursor development.

Secondary leukaemia, which may include AML-M5, has been associated with exposure to epipodophyllotoxins, such as [[etoposide]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kollmannsberger|first=C.|title=Secondary leukemia following high cumulative doses of etoposide in patients treated for advanced germ cell tumors.|journal=J. Clin. Oncol.|date=Oct 1998|volume=16|issue=10|pages=3386–91|doi=10.1200/JCO.1998.16.10.3386|pmid=9779717|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Many cases of AML-M5 are seen to have enhanced phosphorylation of the [[STAT3]] protein due to increased induction of cytokines thus increasing cell proliferation and survival.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=De Kouchkovsky|first1=I.|last2=Abdul-Hay|first2=M.|date=July 2016|title='Acute myeloid leukemia: a comprehensive review and 2016 update'|journal=Blood Cancer Journal|language=en|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e441|doi=10.1038/bcj.2016.50|pmid=27367478|pmc=5030376|issn=2044-5385|doi-access=free}}</ref> Finally, genetic mutations involved in [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] regulation are associated with this leukemia, as they have downstream effects on cell differentiation and proliferation. Excessive cytokine release could be a byproduct of skewed epigenetic regulation.

==Diagnosis==
In order to fulfill [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) criteria for AML-5, a patient must have greater than 20% blasts in the [[bone marrow]], and of these, greater than 80% must be of the [[Monocyte|monocytic]] lineage. A further subclassification (M5a versus M5b) is made depending on whether the monocytic cells are predominantly [[monoblast]]s (>80%) (acute monoblastic leukemia) or a mixture of monoblasts and [[promonocyte]]s (<80% blasts). Monoblasts can be distinguished by having a roughly circular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], delicate lacy [[chromatin]], and abundant, often basophilic [[cytoplasm]]. These cells may also have [[pseudopod]]s. By contrast, promonocytes have a more convoluted nucleus, and their cytoplasm may contain metachromatic granules. Monoblasts are typically [[Myeloperoxidase|MPO]]-negative and promonocytes are MPO variable. Both monoblasts and promonocytes stain positive for [[non-specific esterase]] (NSE), however NSE may often be negative.

Immunophenotypically, M5-AML variably express myeloid ([[CD13]], [[CD33]]) and monocytic ([[CD11b]], [[CD11c]]) markers. Cells may aberrantly express B-cell marker [[CD20]] and the NK marker [[CD56]]. Monoblasts may be positive for [[CD34]].

==Treatment==
AML-M5 is treated with intensive [[chemotherapy]] (such as [[anthracyclines]]) or with [[bone marrow transplantation]]. Tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors are a prominent treatment developed to combat the over activation of cell proliferation proteins induced by AML-5. Inhibiting the STAT3 protein is another useful form of treatment.<ref name=":2" />
