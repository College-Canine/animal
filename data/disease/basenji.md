The '''Basenji''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|dʒ|i}}) is a [[Dog breed|breed]] of [[hunting dog]]. It was bred from stock that originated in central [[Africa]]. The [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] places the breed in the [[Spitz]] and primitive types. The Basenji produces an unusual [[Yodelling|yodel]]-like sound, due to its unusually shaped [[larynx]].<ref>Adapted from the book ''Why Pandas Do Handstands'', 2006, by Augustus Brown.</ref> This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname the 'barkless dog.'<ref name="basenji1945">{{cite web|url=http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor885.htm|title=BCOA African Stock Project – 1945 Letter from Africa|work=basenji.org}}</ref>

Basenjis can run up to 30-35 miles per hour and share many distinctive traits with [[pariah dog]] types. Basenjis come into [[estrus]] only once annually similar to [[dingoes]], [[New Guinea singing dog]]s and [[Tibetan Mastiff]]s, when compared with other dog breeds which may have two or more breeding seasons each year. They lack a [[dog odor|distinctive odor]], and are prone to [[Howling|howls]], yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://akc.org/breeds/basenji/|title=Basenji Dog Breed Information|work=American Kennel Club|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref> The breed's original foundation stock came from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

== Name ==
The [[Azande]] and [[Mangbetu people]] from the northeastern Congo region describe a Basenji, in the local [[Lingala|Lingála]] language, as {{lang|ln|mbwá na basɛ́nzi}}, meaning "dog of the savages" or "dog of the villagers". In the Congo, the Basenji is also known as the "dog of the bush".

The dogs are also known to the Azande of [[South Sudan]] as {{lang|zne|ango angari}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor59.htm|title=BCOA African Stock Project: My Journey into the Home of the Basenji |work=Basenji.org}}</ref>

The word {{lang|ln|basɛ́nzi}} itself is the plural form of {{lang|ln|mosɛ́nzi}}.

In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], another [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], from East Africa, {{lang|sw|mbwa shenzi}} translates to "savage dog". Another local name is ''m'bwa m'kube, 'mbwa wa mwitu'' "wild dog", or "dog that jumps up and down",<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P85eCAAAQBAJ |title=Free Ranging Dogs: Stray, Feral or Wild? |last=de Lavigne |first=Guillaume |publisher=Lulu Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-326-21952-9 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.

== Lineage ==
The Basenji has been identified as a [[Dog breed#Basal breeds|basal breed]] that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.<ref name=larson2012/> DNA studies based on [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome sequences]] indicate that the basenji and the dingo are both considered to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of the domestic dog [[clade]].<ref name=Fan2016/><ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=freedman2014/>

In 2021, the [[genome]] of two basenjis were [[Genome assembly|assembled]], which indicated that the basenji fell within the [[Spitz#Asian breeds|Asian spitz]] group.<ref name=Edwards2021/> The [[AMY2B]] gene produces an enzyme, [[amylase]], that helps to digest starch. The [[wolf]], the [[husky]] and the dingo possess only two copies of this gene, which provides evidence that they arose before the expansion of agriculture.<ref name=freedman2014/> The genomic study found that similarly, the basenji possesses only two copies of this gene.<ref name=Edwards2021/>

== History ==
[[File:Billy Basenji.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A black and white Basenji]]

The Basenji originated on the continent of [[Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dollman |first1=Guy  |date= April 1937 |title=The Basenji Dog
|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/717626 |journal= Journal of the Royal African Society |volume=36|issue=143 |pages=148–149 |jstor=717626 }}</ref> Europeans first described the breed in 1895 in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a distinct breed and called ''basenji'', were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence.

Several attempts were made to introduce the breed into [[England]], but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923 six Basenjis were taken from [[Sudan]], but all six died from [[canine distemper|distemper]] shots received in [[quarantine]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.basenji.org/african/nutting.htm |title=BCOA African Stock Project: Lady Helen Nutting |work=Basenji.org}}</ref> It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then in the [[United States]] by animal importer [[Henry Trefflich]]. It is likely that nearly all the Basenjis in the Western world are descended from these few original imports.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.basenji.org/african/jone8908.htm |title=BCOA African Stock Project: History of the Breed Presented to the AKC |work=Basenji.org|date=August 1989|last= Jones|first=Shirley}}</ref> The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. In 1990, the AKC stud book was reopened to 14 new imports at the request of the Basenji Club of America.<ref>{{cite letter |first=Pamela |last=Geoffroy |recipient=AKC Board of Directors |subject=Letter to AKC Board of Directors |language=en |url=http://www.basenji.org/NativeStock/Correspondence/FirstLetterToAKC.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.basenji.org/NativeStock/Correspondence/FirstLetterToAKC.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> The stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/pdfs/about/board_minutes/0808.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> An American-led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the [[Basankusu]] area of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dibubasenjis.com/congo10|title=Dibu Basenjis: Congo Trip 2010|work=dibubasenjis.com|access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref> Basenjis are also registered with the [[United Kennel Club]].

The popularity of the Basenji in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has declined over the past decade, with the breed ranked 71st in 1999, decreasing to 84th in 2006, and to 93rd in 2011.<ref name="akcdogreg">{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=3 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120511200854/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archive-date=11 May 2012}}</ref>

Basenjis are small, short-haired dogs with erect ears, tightly curled tails and graceful necks. A Basenji's forehead is wrinkled, even more so when it is young or extremely excited. A Basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about {{convert|20–24|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and stand {{convert|16–18|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are as long as they are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size.

They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, chests and tail tips. They can also come in ''trindle'', which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination.

=== Temperament and behavior ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2024}}
The Basenji is alert, energetic, curious and reserved with strangers. The Basenji tends to become emotionally attached to a single human. Basenjis may not get along with non-canine pets. Basenjis dislike wet weather, much like cats, and will often refuse to go outside in any sort of damp conditions. They like to climb, and can easily scale chain wire/link fences.

Basenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a [[meerkat]], by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. Basenjis have a strong prey drive. According to the book ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', they are the second least trainable dog, when required to do human commands (behind only the [[Afghan Hound]]).{{Full citation needed|date=January 2024}} Their real intelligence manifests when they are required to actually solve problems for the sake of the dogs' own goals (such as food, or freedom).

Basenjis are highly prey driven and will go after cats and other small animals.

== Health ==
There is only one completed health survey of dog breeds, including the Basenji, that was conducted by the UK Kennel Club in 2004. The survey indicated the prevalence of diseases in Basenjis with dermatitis (9% of responses), incontinence and bladder infection (5%), hypothyroidism (4%), [[pyometra]] and infertility (4%).<ref name="KC Survey">Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004. [http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Purebred Dog Health Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813043548/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 |date=13 August 2013 }}. Retrieved 5 July 2007</ref>

=== Longevity ===
Basenjis in the 2004 [[UK Kennel Club]] survey had a median lifespan of 13.6 years (sample size of 46 deceased dogs),<ref name="KC Survey"/> which is 1–2 years longer than the median lifespan of other breeds of similar size. The oldest dog in the survey was 17.5 years. The most common causes of death were old age (30%), [[urologic]] (incontinence, [[Fanconi syndrome]], chronic kidney failure 13%), behavior ("unspecified" and aggression 9%), and cancer (9%).<ref name="KC Survey"/>

=== Fanconi syndrome ===

[[Fanconi syndrome]], an inheritable disorder in which the renal (kidney) tubes fail to reabsorb [[electrolyte]]s and nutrients,<ref>{{cite web | url= https://doglime.com/basenji-dog-breed/| title=Health Issues |date=28 February 2019 | publisher= Doglime}}</ref> is unusually common in Basenjis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noonan |first1=C. H. B. |last2=Kay |first2=J. M. |date=1990 |title=Prevalence and Geographic-distribution of Fanconi syndrome in Basenjis in the United States |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=197 |issue=3 |pages=345–349|doi=10.2460/javma.1990.197.03.345 |pmid=2391269 }}</ref> Symptoms include excessive drinking, excessive urination, and glucose in the urine, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetes. Fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. Fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog's urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies. A Fanconi disease management protocol has been developed that can be used by veterinarians to treat Fanconi-afflicted dogs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gonto |first1=Steve |title=Fanconi Renal Disease Management Protocol for Veterinarians |url= https://basenjicompanions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/aaa_fanconi-protocol-feb-2016.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://basenjicompanions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/aaa_fanconi-protocol-feb-2016.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |date=12 February 2016 |publisher=Basenji Club of America |via=Basenji Companions website |access-date=22 February 2018}}</ref>

=== Other Basenji health issues ===
Basenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene that, when [[homozygous]] for the defect, causes [[hemolysis|genetic hemolytic anemia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenjiweb.com/basenji-health-issues.html|title=Basenji Health Issues|work=basenjiweb.com|access-date=22 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820121605/http://www.basenjiweb.com/basenji-health-issues.html|archive-date=20 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most 21st-century Basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean. When lineage from a fully tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As this is a non-invasive DNA test, a Basenji can be tested for HA at any time.

Basenjis sometimes suffer from [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], resulting in loss of mobility and arthritis-like symptoms. All dogs should be tested by either [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] or [[PennHIP]] prior to breeding.

[[Malabsorption]], or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], chronic [[diarrhea]], and even death. A special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.

The breed can also fall victim to [[progressive retinal atrophy]] (a degeneration of the retina causing blindness) and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as [[coloboma]] (a hole in the eye structure), and [[persistent pupillary membrane]] (tiny threads across the pupil).

== In popular culture ==
* In [[Nyanga people|Nyanga]] mythology, [[Rukuba]] was a talking Basenji and the pet of the fire god [[Nyamuriri]]. A man named either [[Nkhango]] or Mikhango convinced Rukuba to help him steal fire for his people. Angered by this, Nyamuriri sent his dog away. In some versions, he also takes the dog's ability to speak. In most versions, Rukuba is still able to speak when he goes to live with the Nyanga, but refuses to do so anymore once Nkhango tries to make him a messenger for the village.<ref>Coren, Stanley (2004).

* The title character of the 1954 novel ''[[Good-bye, My Lady]]'', by [[James H. Street]], is a Basenji (female). The book was made into a [[Good-bye, My Lady (film)|film of the same name]] in 1956, with a cast that included [[Brandon deWilde]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Sidney Poitier]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049271/ |title=Good-bye, My Lady |first=Robert D. |last=Ruplenas |date=12 May 1956|work=IMDb}}</ref> Several Basenjis were used in the lead role, the main "star" being "My Lady of the Congo" a six-month-old Basenji bred by Veronica Tudor-Williams of Molesey, England. She was followed by four other young Basenjis to act as doubles including her sibling, "My Lord of the Congo", and "Flageolet of the Congo", (who would become an International Champion). "My Lady" did most of the scenes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpurebreddogday.com/i-had-me-a-dog-and-it-was-a-basenji/|title="I Had Me a Dog" (And it Was a Basenji)|date=2017-08-26|website=National Purebred Dog Day®|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>

* Basenjis are featured in the fourth episode ("Tyler Tucker, I Presume?") of the third season of the animated television series ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]''. [[List of The Wild Thornberrys characters|Nigel Thornberry]] encounters a group of tribesmen along with their [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] hunting dogs. The series's director, [[Mark Risley]], owns several Basenjis, and his dogs provided the recorded voices for their animated counterparts.
* An episode of ''[[Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)|Pound Puppies]]'', "The Pups Who Loved Me", revolves around a Basenji secret agent character by the name of Bondo. The dog is drawn with an appropriate likeness, but appears to bark, which is uncharacteristic of the breed.
*Basenjis are featured in the first part of ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (India).
*A Basenji dog is one of the main protagonists of the novel ''August Magic'' by Veronica Anne Starbuck.
*Anubis, the barkless dog, is a Basenji dog featured in the horror movies ''[[Soulmate (2013 film)|Soulmate]]'' and ''[[Tales of Halloween]]''. 
*''Yodels, Wails and Basenji Tails'' – the 1998 book that features a compilation of Basenji stories.
*''The Story of Tongdaeng'' by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand features one of his pets [[Tongdaeng]], the Basenji dog.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phrarātchaniphon Phrabāt Somdēt Phrachaoyūhūa Phūmiphon ʻAdunlayadēt rư̄ang Thō̜ngdǣng/ His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej biography of a pet dog, the story of Tongdaeng.|last=Adulyadej, King of Thailand|first=Bhumibol|publisher=Amarin Printing & Publishing Company Limited|year=2002|isbn=978-9742726263|location=Krung Thēp|oclc=51802777}}</ref>
