'''Sandfly''' or '''sand fly''' is a colloquial name for any species or [[genus]] of flying, biting, [[blood-sucking]] [[diptera]]n (fly) encountered in sandy areas. In the [[United States]], ''sandfly'' may refer to certain [[horse fly|horse flies]] that are also known as "greenheads" (family ''[[Horse-fly|Tabanidae]]''), or to members of the family ''[[Ceratopogonidae]]''. The bites usually result in a small, intensely itchy bump or welt, the strength of which intensifies over a period of 5-7 days before dissipating.  Moderate relief is achieved with varying success through the application of over the counter products such as [[Benadryl]] (ingested) or an [[analgesic]] cream such as [[After Bite]] (applied topically).  Outside the United States, ''sandfly'' may refer to members of the subfamily [[Phlebotominae]] within the [[Psychodidae]]. Biting midges ([[Ceratopogonidae]]) are sometimes called sandflies or no-see-ums (no-see-em, noseeum). [[New Zealand]] sandflies are in the genus of sand fly  ''[[Austrosimulium]]'', a type of [[black fly]].<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/sandflies-and-mosquitoes/1 Sandflies and mosquitoes – Sandflies: New Zealand's blackflies]. ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand'' (2009-03-01). Retrieved on 2011-06-15.</ref>

In the various sorts of sandfly only the female is responsible for biting and sucking the blood of mammals, reptiles and birds; the protein in the blood is necessary for the production of eggs, making the sandfly an [[anautogenous]] reproducer.

Some sandfly genera of the subfamily Phlebotominae are the primary vectors of [[leishmaniasis]] and [[pappataci fever]]; both diseases are confusingly referred to as sandfly fever. In Asia, Africa, and Europe, leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies of the genus ''[[Phlebotomus]]''; in the Americas, the disease is spread by sandflies of the genus ''[[Lutzomyia]]''. [[Belize]] and [[Honduras]] are notorious in the [[Caribbean]] for their sandfly populations and travel pages frequently warn tourists to bring bug spray containing high concentrations of [[DEET]].

==Viruses==

Among the viruses that sandflies can carry is the [[Chandipura virus]], which, as a cousin of [[rabies]], is deadly.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Fontenille, D. |author2=Traore-Lamizana, M. |author3=Trouillet, J. |author4=Leclerc, A. |author5=Mondo, M. |author6=Ba, Y. |author7=Digoutte, J.

[[Leishmaniasis]], a disease caused by several species of the genus [[Leishmania]], is transmitted by various sandflies.<ref name=Aoun>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aoun | first1 = K. | last2 = Bouratbine | first2 = A. | title = Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in North Africa: a review. | journal = Parasite | volume = 21 | pages = 14 | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1051/parasite/2014014 | pmid = 24626301 |pmc = 3952656}}</ref>

''[[Leishmania donovani]]'' causes spiking fevers, [[hepatosplenomegaly]], and [[pancytopenia]]. It can be diagnosed through microscopic review by visualizing [[amastigote]]s in containing [[macrophage]]s, and is treatable with [[sodium stibogluconate]].

==Bacteria==

''[[Bartonella bacilliformis]]'', the causal agent of [[Carrion's disease]], is transmitted by different members of the genus ''Lutzomyia''. This disease is restricted to Andean areas of Peru and Ecuador, with historical reports in Southern Colombia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gomes |first1=Cláudia |last2=Ruiz |first2=Joaquim |title=Carrion's disease.

==Prevention==

Over-the-counter repellents with high concentrations of [[DEET]] or [[picaridin]] are proven to work; however effectiveness seems to differ among individuals with some people reporting better results with one product over another while other people finding neither product effective for them. This may be partially due to various species living in different areas.

A particular extract of [[p-Menthane-3,8-diol|lemon eucalyptus oil]] (not the essential oil) has now been shown to be as effective as DEET in various studies.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8827615 |year=1996 |last1=Trigg |first1=JK |title=Evaluation of a eucalyptus-based repellent against Culicoides impunctatus (Diptera:Ceratopogonidae) in Scotland |volume=12 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=329–30 |journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17067050 |year=2006 |last1=Carroll |first1=SP |last2=Loye |first2=J |title=Field test of a lemon eucalyptus repellent against Leptoconops biting midges |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=483–5 |journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association |doi=10.2987/8756-971X(2006)22[483:FTOALE]2.0.CO;2|s2cid=46198676 }}</ref>

Most information on repellents focuses on mosquitoes, but mosquito repellents are effective for sandflies and [[midges]] as well.<ref>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: [https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/RepellentUpdates.htm CDC: West Nile Virus – Updated Insect Repellent].

==Cultural views==

[[New Zealand]] sandflies (which are taxonomically blackflies—[[Simulidae]]) have a native [[Māori mythology|Māori]] legend wherein "the god Tu-te-raki-whanoa had just finished creating the landscape of [[Fiordland]], it was absolutely stunning... so stunning that it stopped people from working. They just stood around gazing at the beauty instead. The goddess [[Hine-nui-te-pō]] became angry at these unproductive people, so she created the sandfly to bite them and get them moving".<ref>[http://www.igougo.com/story-s1348575-New_Zealand-Sandflies.html Sandflies – New Zealand – IgoUgo – stomps].

These sand flies were able, according to another Māori legend, to revive the dead hero [[Hatupatu|Ha-tupatu]].<ref>[http://www.maori.org.nz/korero/default.asp?pid=sp62&parent=55 Ha-tupatu and the sand flies]. Maori.org.nz. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.</ref>
