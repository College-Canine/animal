The '''nasolacrimal duct''' (also called the '''tear duct''') carries [[tears]] from the [[lacrimal sac]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] into the [[nasal cavity]].<ref name="Medscape 2020">{{Cite journal|date=2020-02-19|title=Nasolacrimal System Anatomy: Embryology, Puncta, Canaliculi|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/835092-overview}}</ref><ref name="Herbert Janardhan Pandiri Cesta 2018 pp. 391–435">{{cite book | last1=Herbert | first1=Ronald A. | last2=Janardhan | first2=Kyathanahalli S. | last3=Pandiri | first3=Arun R. | last4=Cesta | first4=Mark F. | last5=Miller | first5=Rodney A. | title=Boorman's Pathology of the Rat | chapter=Nose, Larynx, and Trachea | publisher=Elsevier | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-12-391448-4 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-391448-4.00022-8 | pages=391–435 | s2cid=80517730 | quote=The paired nasolacrimal ducts carry lacrimal secretions from the eye to the nasal cavity, and originate as oval openings near the edge of the medial canthus of the eyelids.  Initially the duct is small and circular, but in the middle portion, the diameter increases and the appearance is more oblong and saccular. The diameter again decreases before the duct enters the ventrolateral nasal vestibule medial to the root of the incisor tooth approximately 2 mm caudal to the nares.}}</ref> The duct begins in the [[eye socket]] between the [[maxilla]]ry and [[lacrimal bone]]s, from where it passes downwards and backwards. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior [[nasal meatus]] of the nasal cavity is partially covered by a mucosal fold ([[Hasner's valve|valve of Hasner]] or ''plica lacrimalis'').<ref name="Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary 2020">{{cite web | title=Medical Definition of PLICA LACRIMALIS | website=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary | date=2020-05-08 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/plica+lacrimalis | access-date=2020-05-08 | quote=an imperfect valve at the opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior meatus of the nose}}</ref>

Excess tears flow through the nasolacrimal duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus. This is the reason the [[Rhinorrhea|nose starts to run]] when a person is [[crying]] or has watery eyes from an allergy, and why one can sometimes taste [[eye drops]]. This is for the same reason when applying some eye drops it is often advised to close the nasolacrimal duct by pressing it with a finger to prevent the medicine from escaping the eye and having unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body as it will proceed through the canal to the nasal cavity.

Like the lacrimal sac, the duct is lined by [[stratified columnar epithelium]] containing mucus-secreting [[goblet cells]], and is surrounded by connective tissue.

The secretions collect around the orifice of the duct and in the corner of the eye, where they thicken, resulting in a gooey, sticky substance that further clogs any drainage route.}}</ref><ref name="Stagner Jakobiec Eagle Charles 2018 pp. 648–685">{{cite book | last1=Stagner | first1=Anna M. | last2=Jakobiec | first2=Frederick A. | last3=Eagle | first3=Ralph C. | last4=Charles | first4=Norman C. | title=Diagnostic Pathology of Infectious Disease | chapter=Infections of the Eye and Its Adnexa | publisher=Elsevier | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-323-44585-6 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-44585-6.00021-7 | pages=648–685 | quote=Dacryocystitis is produced by obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct with resultant tear stasis.

Persons with dry eye conditions can be fitted with [[punctal plug]]s that seal the ducts to limit the amount of fluid drainage and retain moisture.

During an ear [[infection]], excess mucus may drain through the nasolacrimal duct in the opposite way tears drain. {{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The canal containing the nasolacrimal duct is called the [[nasolacrimal canal]].

In [[humans]], the tear ducts in males tend to be larger than the ones in females.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703922804576300903183512350 "Tears of Men and Women Are Different"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', mirrored at [http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/05/04/river-men-women-shed-different-tears/ "Why Men and Women Shed Different Tears"], [[Fox News]], May 5, 2011.</ref>
