<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Benign prostatic hyperplasia''' ('''BPH'''), also called '''prostate enlargement''', is a noncancerous increase in size of the [[prostate gland]].<ref name=NIH2014 /> Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, [[urinary retention|inability to urinate]], or [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]].<ref name=NIH2014 /> Complications can include [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[bladder stone]]s, and [[chronic kidney problems]].<ref name=Kim2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim EH, Larson JA, Andriole GL | title = Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 67 | pages = 137–51 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26331999 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-063014-123902 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}</ref>

<!-- Cause and pathophysiology -->
The cause is unclear.<ref name=NIH2014 /> Risk factors include a family history, [[obesity]], [[type 2 diabetes]], not enough exercise, and [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref name=NIH2014 /> Medications like [[pseudoephedrine]], [[anticholinergic]]s, and [[calcium channel blocker]]s may worsen symptoms.<ref name=Kim2016 /> The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the [[urethra]] and thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the [[bladder]].<ref name=NIH2014 /> Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and [[Physical examination|examination]] after ruling out other possible causes.<ref name=Kim2016 />

BPH can be a progressive disease, especially if left untreated. Incomplete voiding results in residual urine or urinary stasis, which can lead to an increased risk of [[urinary tract infection]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Truzzi JC, Almeida FM, Nunes EC, Sadi MV | title = Residual urinary volume and urinary tract infection--when are they linked? | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 180 | issue = 1 | pages = 182–5 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18499191 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2008.03.044 }}</ref>

== Causes ==
=== Hormones ===
Most experts consider [[androgen]]s ([[testosterone]] and related [[hormone]]s) to play a permissive role in the development of BPH. This means that androgens must be present for BPH to occur, but do not necessarily directly cause the condition. This is supported by evidence suggesting that [[castration|castrated]] boys do not develop BPH when they age. In an unusual study of 26 [[eunuch]]s from the palace of the [[Qing dynasty]] still living in [[Beijing]] in 1960, the prostate could not be felt in 81% of the studied eunuchs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu CP, Gu FL | title = The prostate in eunuchs | journal = Progress in Clinical and Biological Research | volume = 370 | pages = 249–55 | date = 1991 | pmid = 1924456 }}</ref> The average time since castration was 54 years (range, 41–65 years). On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone.<ref>{{cite web |title = Testosterone and Aging: Clinical Research Directions. |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |publisher = NCBI Bookshelf |access-date = 2 February 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194336/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |archive-date = 5 November 2017}}</ref>

[[Dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), a [[metabolite]] of testosterone, is a critical mediator of prostatic growth. DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]], type 2. DHT can act in an [[autocrine]] fashion on the stromal cells or in [[paracrine]] fashion by diffusing into nearby [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear [[androgen receptor]]s and signals the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[growth factor]]s that are mitogenic to the epithelial and stromal cells. DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly. The importance of DHT in causing [[nodule (medicine)|nodular]] hyperplasia is supported by clinical observations in which an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of 5α-reductase such as [[finasteride]] is given to men with this condition. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |title = Proscar (finisteride) Prescribing Information |url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |website = FDA – Drug Documents |publisher = Merck and Company |access-date = 2 March 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231752/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |archive-date = 3 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartsch G, Rittmaster RS, Klocker H | title = Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = World Journal of Urology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 413–25 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 12022710 | doi = 10.1007/s00345-002-0248-5 | s2cid = 3257666 }}</ref>

Besides testosterone and DHT, other androgens are also known to play a crucial role in BPH development. {{chem|C|21}} 11-oxygenated steroids (pregnanes) have been identified are precursors to 11-oxygenated androgens which are also potent agonists for the androgen receptor.<ref name="pmid18308097">{{cite journal|vauthors=Dimitrakov J, Joffe HV, Soldin SJ, Bolus R, Buffington CA, Nickel JC|year=2008|title=Adrenocortical hormone abnormalities in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|journal=Urology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=261–6|doi=10.1016/j.urology.2007.09.025|pmc=2390769|pmid=18308097}}</ref> Specifically, steroids like [[11β-hydroxyprogesterone]] and [[11-ketoprogesterone]] can be converted to [[11-ketodihydrotestosterone]], an 11-oxo form of DHT with the same potency.

However, repeated contractions and dilations of myofibers will unavoidably cause injuries and broken myofibers. Myofibers have a low potential for regeneration; therefore, collagen fibers need to be used to replace the broken myofibers. Such misrepairs make the muscular tissue weak in functioning, and the fluid secreted by glands cannot be excreted completely. Then, the accumulation of fluid in glands increases the resistance of muscular tissue during the movements of contractions and dilations, and more and more myofibers will be broken and replaced by collagen fibers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Roehrborn |first=Claus G |title=Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: An Overview |journal=Rev Urol |date=2005 |volume=7 |issue=Suppl 9 |pages=S3–S14 |pmid=16985902 |pmc=1477638 }}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Benign prostate hyperplasia.jpg|thumb|right|Benign prostate hyperplasia]]
As men age, the enzymes [[aromatase]] and [[5-alpha reductase]] increase in activity. These enzymes are responsible for converting androgen hormones into [[estrogen]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]], respectively. This metabolism of androgen hormones leads to a decrease in testosterone but increased levels of DHT and estrogen.

Both the glandular epithelial cells and the stromal cells (including muscular fibers) undergo hyperplasia in BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Most sources agree that of the two tissues, stromal hyperplasia predominates, but the exact ratio of the two is unclear.<ref name=Wasserman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasserman NF | title = Benign prostatic hyperplasia: a review and ultrasound classification | journal = Radiologic Clinics of North America | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 689–710, viii | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17030221 | doi = 10.1016/j.rcl.2006.07.005 }}</ref>{{rp|694}}

Anatomically the median and lateral lobes are usually enlarged, due to their highly glandular composition. The anterior lobe has little in the way of glandular tissue and is seldom enlarged. (Carcinoma of the prostate typically occurs in the posterior lobe – hence the ability to discern an irregular outline per rectal examination). The earliest microscopic signs of BPH usually begin between the age of 30 and 50 years old in the PUG, which is posterior to the proximal urethra.<ref name=Wasserman />{{rp|694}} In BPH, the majority of growth occurs in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate.<ref name=Wasserman />{{rp|694}} In addition to these two classic areas, the peripheral zone (PZ) is also involved to a lesser extent.<ref name=Wasserman />{{rp|695}} Prostatic cancer typically occurs in the PZ. However, BPH nodules, usually from the TZ are often biopsied anyway to rule out cancer in the TZ.<ref name=Wasserman />{{rp|695}} BPH can be a progressive growth that in rare instances leads to exceptional enlargement.<ref name=Sch2011/> In some males, the prostate enlargement exceeds 200 to 500 grams.<ref name=Sch2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ojewola RW, Tijani KH, Fatuga AL, Onyeze CI, Okeke CJ | title = Management of a giant prostatic enlargement: Case report and review of the literature | journal = The Nigerian Postgraduate Medical Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–247 | year = 2020 | pmid = 32687126 | doi = 10.4103/npmj.npmj_69_20 | publisher = Medknow | s2cid = 220652018 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This condition has been defined as giant prostatic hyperplasia (GPH).<ref name=Sch2011/>

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical diagnosis of BPH is based on a history of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), a digital rectal exam, and exclusion of other causes of similar signs and symptoms. The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond to the size of the prostate. An enlarged prostate gland on [[rectal examination]] that is symmetric and smooth supports a diagnosis of BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or nodular, this raises concern for prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" />

Validated questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] (I-PSS), and more recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia) are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms.<ref name="Kim2016" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parsons JK | title = Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Epidemiology and Risk Factors | journal = Current Bladder Dysfunction Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 212–218 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21475707 | pmc = 3061630 | doi = 10.1007/s11884-010-0067-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eid K, Krughoff K, Stoimenova D, Smith D, Phillips J, O'Donnell C, Barqawi A | title = Validation of the Urgency, Weak stream, Incomplete emptying, and Nocturia (UWIN) score compared with the American Urological Association Symptoms Score in assessing lower urinary tract symptoms in the clinical setting | journal = Urology | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 181–5 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24139351 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2013.08.039 }}</ref>

===Laboratory investigations===
[[Urinalysis]] is typically performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate for signs of a urinary tract infection, [[glycosuria|glucose in the urine]] (suggestive of diabetes), or [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]] (suggestive of kidney disease).<ref name="Kim2016" /> Bloodwork including [[Renal function|kidney function tests]] and [[prostate specific antigen]] (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively.<ref name="Kim2016" /> However, checking blood PSA levels for [[prostate cancer screening]] is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well.<ref name="Kim2016" /> If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" />

===Imaging and other investigations===
Uroflowmetry is done to measure the rate of urine flow and total volume of urine voided when the subject is urinating.<ref name="pmid30614059">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gammie A, Drake MJ | title = The fundamentals of uroflowmetry practice, based on International Continence Society good urodynamic practices recommendations | journal = Neurourology and Urodynamics | volume = 37 | issue = S6 | pages = S44–S49 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30614059 | doi = 10.1002/nau.23777 | s2cid = 58586667 | url = | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Abdominal ultrasound examination of the prostate and [[kidney]]s is often performed to rule out [[hydronephrosis]] and hydroureter. Incidentally, cysts, tumours, and stones may be found on ultrasound. [[Urinary retention#Diagnosis|Post-void residual volume]] of more than 100 ml may indicate significant obstruction.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Foo KT |date=June 2013 |title=The Role of Transabdominal Ultrasound in Office Urology |journal=Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare |language=en |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=125–130 |doi=10.1177/201010581302200208 |s2cid=74205747 |issn=2010-1058|doi-access=free }}</ref> Prostate size of 30 cc or more indicates enlargement of the prostate.<ref name="pmid31340802">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aprikian S, Luz M, Brimo F, Scarlata E, Hamel L, Cury FL, Tanguay S, Aprikian AG, Kassouf W, Chevalier S | display-authors = 6 | title = Improving ultrasound-based prostate volume estimation | journal = BMC Urology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 68 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31340802 | pmc = 6657110 | doi = 10.1186/s12894-019-0492-2 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Prostatic calcification can be detected through transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Calcification is due to solidification of prostatic secretions or calcified [[corpora amylacea]] ([[hyaline]] masses on the prostate gland). Calcification is also found in a variety of other conditions such as prostatitis, [[Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|chronic pelvic pain syndrome]], and prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitzing YX, Prando A, Varol C, Karczmar GS, Maclean F, Oto A | title = Benign Conditions That Mimic Prostate Carcinoma: MR Imaging Features with Histopathologic Correlation | journal = Radiographics | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 162–175 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26587887 | pmc = 5496681 | doi = 10.1148/rg.2016150030 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh S, Martin E, Tregidgo HF, Treeby B, Bandula S | title = Prostatic calcifications: Quantifying occurrence, radiodensity, and spatial distribution in prostate cancer patients | journal = Urologic Oncology | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 728.e1–728.e6 | date = October 2021 | pmid = 33485763 | pmc = 8492071 | doi = 10.1016/j.urolonc.2020.12.028 }}</ref> For those with elevated levels of PSA, TRUS guided biopsy is performed to take a sample of the prostate for investigation.<ref name="pmid20199941">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitterberger M, Horninger W, Aigner F, Pinggera GM, Steppan I, Rehder P, Frauscher F | title = Ultrasound of the prostate | journal = Cancer Imaging | volume = 10 | issue =  1| pages = 40–48 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20199941 | pmc = 2842183 | doi = 10.1102/1470-7330.2010.0004 }}</ref> Although MRI is more accurate than TRUS in determining prostate volume, TRUS is less expensive and almost as accurate as MRI.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
==== Medical conditions ====
The differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as [[bladder cancer]], urinary tract infection, [[urethral stricture]], [[Ureterolithiasis|urethral calculi (stones)]], [[chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|chronic prostatitis]], and prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" /> [[Neurogenic bladder]] can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms similar to those of BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the [[central nervous system]] such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], and [[alcoholic neuropathy|alcohol-induced nerve damage]].<ref name="Kim2016" /> Individuals affected by [[heart failure]] often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.<ref name="Kim2016" />

==== Medications ====
Certain medications can increase urination difficulties by increasing bladder outlet resistance due to increased [[smooth muscle]] tone at the prostate or bladder neck and contribute to LUTS.<ref name="Kim2016" /> [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist]] medications, such as [[decongestant]]s with [[pseudoephedrine]] can increase bladder outlet resistance.<ref name="Kim2016" /> In contrast, [[calcium channel blocker]]s and [[anticholinergic]] medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Diuretic medications such as [[loop diuretic]]s (e.g., [[furosemide]]) or [[thiazide]]s (e.g., [[chlorthalidone]]) can cause or worsen urinary frequency and nighttime awakenings to urinate.<ref name="Kim2016" />

== Management ==
When treating and managing benign prostatic hyperplasia, the aim is to prevent complications related to the disease and improve or relieve symptoms.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hwang EC, Gandhi S, Jung JH, Imamura M, Kim MH, Pang R, Dahm P | title = Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | pages = CD007360 | date = October 2018 | issue = 10 | pmid = 30306544 | pmc = 6516835 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007360.pub3 }}</ref> Approaches used include lifestyle modifications, medications, catheterisation and surgery.

=== Lifestyle ===
Lifestyle alterations to address the symptoms of BPH include physical activity,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva V, Grande AJ, Peccin MS | title = Physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | issue = 4 | pages = CD012044 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 30953341 | pmc = 6450803 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012044.pub2 }}</ref> decreasing fluid intake before bedtime, moderating the consumption of alcohol and caffeine-containing products and following a timed voiding schedule.

Patients can also attempt to avoid products and medications with [[anticholinergic]] properties that may exacerbate urinary retention symptoms of BPH, including [[antihistamine]]s, [[decongestant]]s, [[opioid]]s, and [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s; however, changes in medications should be done with input from a medical professional.<ref>{{cite web |title = Benign prostatic hyperplasia |url = http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia |publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170425092640/http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia |archive-date = 25 April 2017 }}</ref>

==== Physical activity ====
Physical activity has been recommended as a treatment for urinary tract symptoms. A 2019 Cochrane review of six studies involving 652 men assessing the effects of physical activity alone, physical activity as a part of a self-management program, among others.  However, the quality of evidence was very low and therefore it remains uncertain whether physical activity is helpful in men experiencing urinary symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva V, Grande AJ, Peccin MS | title = Physical activity for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | pages = CD012044 | date = April 2019 | issue = 4 | pmid = 30953341 | pmc = 6450803 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012044.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Urology Group }}</ref>

==== Voiding position ====
Voiding position when urinating may influence urodynamic parameters (urinary flow rate, voiding time, and post-void residual volume).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mednet.nl/wosmedia/1718/mictiehouding_tvu.pdf |title = Influence of voiding posture on urodynamic parameters in men: a literature review | vauthors = De Jong Y, Pinckaers JH, Ten Brinck RM, Lycklama à Nijeholt AA  |publisher = Nederlands Tijdschrift voor urologie |access-date = 2 July 2014 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714200739/http://www.mednet.nl/wosmedia/1718/mictiehouding_tvu.pdf |archive-date = 14 July 2014}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis]] found no differences between the standing and sitting positions for healthy males, but that, for elderly males with lower urinary tract symptoms, voiding in the sitting position-- <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Jong Y, Pinckaers JH, ten Brinck RM, Lycklama à Nijeholt AA, Dekkers OM | title = Urinating standing versus sitting: position is of influence in men with prostate enlargement.

====Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE)====

A 2018 Cochrane review of studies on men over 60 with moderate to severe [[lower urinary tract symptoms]] analyzed the impacts of [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]]s (PDE) in comparison to other drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pattanaik S, Mavuduru RS, Panda A, Mathew JL, Agarwal MM, Hwang EC, Lyon JA, Singh SK, Mandal AK | display-authors = 6 | title = Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | pages = CD010060 | date = November 2018 | issue = 11 | pmid = 30480763 | pmc = 6517182 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010060.pub2 | url = | collaboration = Cochrane Urology Group }}</ref> These drugs may improve urinary symptoms slightly and reduce urinary bother but may also cause more side effects compared to placebo. The evidence in this review found that there is probably no difference between PDE and [[alpha blocker]]s, however when used in combination they may provide a greater improvement in symptoms (with more side effects). PDE also likely improves symptoms when used in combination with [[5-alpha reductase inhibitors]].

Several phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are also effective, but may require multiple doses daily to maintain adequate urine flow.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Bao Y, Liu J, Duan L, Cui Y | title = Tadalafil 5 mg Once Daily Improves Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Erectile Dysfunction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–92 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29341503 | doi = 10.1111/luts.12144 | s2cid = 23929021 }}</ref><ref name="Pattanaik CD010060">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pattanaik S, Mavuduru RS, Panda A, Mathew JL, Agarwal MM, Hwang EC, Lyon JA, Singh SK, Mandal AK | display-authors = 6 | title = Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | pages = CD010060 | date = November 2018 | issue = 11 | pmid = 30480763 | pmc = 6517182 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010060.pub2 }}</ref> [[Tadalafil]], a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, was considered then rejected by NICE in the UK for the treatment of symptoms associated with BPH.<ref name="guidance.nice.org.uk">{{cite web |title = Hyperplasia (benign prostatic) – tadalafil (terminated appraisal) (TA273) |url = http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA273 |work = National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) |date = 23 January 2013 |access-date = 27 January 2013 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130224050938/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA273 |archive-date = 24 February 2013}}</ref> In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and for the treatment of BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED), when the conditions occur simultaneously.<ref name="fda.gov">{{cite web |title = FDA approves Cialis to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia |url = https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm274642.htm |work = U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) |access-date = 7 May 2013 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130511011121/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm274642.htm |archive-date = 11 May 2013}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia}}

[[File:Rtu.jpg|thumb|right|Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)]]

If medical treatment is not effective, surgery may be performed. Surgical techniques used include the following:
* [[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP): the gold standard.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco JV, Garegnani L, Escobar Liquitay CM, Borofsky M, Dahm P | title = Transurethral microwave thermotherapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2021 | issue = 6 | pages = CD004135 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 34180047 | pmc = 8236484 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004135.pub4 }}</ref> TURP is thought to be the most effective approach for improving urinary symptoms and urinary flow, however, this surgical procedure may be associated with complications in up to 20% of men.<ref name=":0" /> Surgery carries some risk of complications, such as [[retrograde ejaculation]] (most commonly), [[erectile dysfunction]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[urethral stricture]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transurethral-resection-of-the-prostate-turp/risks/|title=Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) - Risks|date=2017-10-24|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>
* [[Transurethral incision of the prostate]] (TUIP): rarely performed; the technique is similar to TURP but less definitive.
* Open [[prostatectomy]]: not usually performed nowadays due to its high morbidity, even if results are very good.
Other less invasive surgical approaches (requiring [[Spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]]) include:
* [[Holmium laser ablation of the prostate]] (HoLAP)
* [[Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate]] (HoLeP)
* Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP)
* Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP)
* [[Aquablation therapy]]: a type of surgery using a water jet to remove prostatic tissue.

=== Minimally invasive procedures ===
Some less invasive procedures are available according to patients' preferences and co-morbidities. These are performed as [[outpatient procedure]]s with [[local anesthesia]].
* [[Prostatic artery embolization]]: an endovascular procedure performed in [[interventional radiology]].<ref name="pmid28032133">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuang M, Vu A, Athreya S | title = A Systematic Review of Prostatic Artery Embolization in the Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia | journal = CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 655–663 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28032133 | doi = 10.1007/s00270-016-1539-3 | s2cid = 12154537 }}</ref> Through [[catheter]]s, embolic agents are released in the main branches of the prostatic artery, in order to induce a decrease in the size of the prostate gland, thus reducing the urinary symptoms.<ref name="pmid27019980">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisco J, Bilhim T, Pinheiro LC, Fernandes L, Pereira J, Costa NV, Duarte M, Oliveira AG | display-authors = 6 | title = Prostate Embolization as an Alternative to Open Surgery in Patients with Large Prostate and Moderate to Severe Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms | journal = Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 700–8 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27019980 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2016.01.138 }}</ref>
* [[Prostate steam treatment|Water vapor thermal therapy]] (marketed as Rezum): This is a newer office procedure for removing prostate tissue using steam aimed at preserving sexual function.
* [[Prostatic urethral lift]] (marketed as UroLift): This intervention consists of a system of a device and an implant designed to pull the prostatic lobe away from the urethra.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McNicholas TA | title = Benign prostatic hyperplasia and new treatment options - a critical appraisal of the UroLift system | journal =  Medical Devices: Evidence and Research| volume = 9 | pages = 115–23 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27274321 | pmc = 4876946 | doi = 10.2147/MDER.S60780 | url =  | doi-access = free }}</ref>
* [[Transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT) is an outpatient procedure that is less invasive compared to surgery and involves using microwaves (heat) to shrink prostate tissue that is enlarged.<ref name=":0" />

The prostate gets larger in most men as they get older. For a symptom-free man of 46 years, the risk of developing BPH over the next 30 years is 45%. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] rates increase from 3 cases per 1000 man-years at age 45–49 years, to 38 cases per 1000 man-years by the age of 75–79 years. While the [[prevalence]] rate is 2.7% for men aged 45–49, it increases to 24% by the age of 80 years.<ref name="pmid12361895">{{cite journal | vauthors = Verhamme KM, Dieleman JP, Bleumink GS, van der Lei J, Sturkenboom MC, Artibani W, Begaud B, Berges R, Borkowski A, Chappel CR, Costello A, Dobronski P, Farmer RD, Jiménez Cruz F, Jonas U, MacRae K, Pientka L, Rutten FF, van Schayck CP, Speakman MJ, Sturkenboom MC, Tiellac P, Tubaro A, Vallencien G, Vela Navarrete R | display-authors = 6 | title = Incidence and prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care--the Triumph project | journal = European Urology | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 323–8 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12361895 | doi = 10.1016/S0302-2838(02)00354-8 | collaboration = Triumph Pan European Expert Panel }}</ref>
