'''''Patent ductus arteriosus''''' ('''PDA''') is a medical condition in which the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'' fails to close after [[childbirth|birth]]: this allows a portion of oxygenated [[blood]] from the left [[heart]] to flow back to the lungs through the [[aorta]], which has a higher [[blood pressure]], to the [[pulmonary artery]], which has a lower blood pressure. Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased [[work of breathing]] and [[Failure to thrive|failure to gain weight at a normal rate]]. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to [[pulmonary hypertension]] followed by right-sided [[heart failure]].

The ''ductus arteriosus'' is a [[Fetal circulation|fetal blood vessel]] that normally closes soon after birth. This closure is caused by vessel constriction immediately after birth as circulation changes occur, followed by the occlusion of the vessel’s lumen in the following days.<ref>{{Citation |last=Clyman |first=Ronald I. |title=Mechanisms Regulating Closure of the Ductus Arteriosus |date=2017 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780323352147000573 |work=Fetal and Neonatal Physiology |pages=592–599.e4 |access-date=2023-11-14 |publisher=Elsevier |language=en |doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-35214-7.00057-3 |isbn=978-0-323-35214-7}}</ref> In a PDA, the vessel does not close, but remains ''patent'' (open), resulting in an abnormal transmission of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. PDA is common in newborns with persistent respiratory problems such as [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and has a high occurrence in [[premature newborn]]s. Premature newborns are more likely to be hypoxic and have PDA due to underdevelopment of the heart and lungs.

If the congenital defect [[transposition of the great vessels]] is present in addition to a PDA, the PDA is not surgically closed since it is the only way that oxygenated blood can mix with deoxygenated blood. In these cases, [[prostaglandin]]s are used to keep the PDA open, and NSAIDs are not administered until surgical correction of the two defects is completed.

In full-term newborns, PDA occurs in 1 in 2,000 births, and accounts for 5–10% of congenital heart disease cases. PDA occurs in 20–60% of all premature newborns, where its incidence inversely linked with gestational age and weight.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dice |first1=JE |last2=Bhatia |first2=J |title=Patent ductus arteriosus: an overview. |journal=The Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics |date=July 2007 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=138–46 |doi=10.5863/1551-6776-12.3.138 |pmid=23055849 |pmc=3462096 }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms include:{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
* [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath)

Signs include:{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
* [[tachycardia]] (a heart rate exceeding the normal resting rate)
* continuous "machine-like" (also described as "rolling-thunder" and "to-and-fro") [[heart murmur]] (usually from aorta to pulmonary artery, with higher flow during [[systole]] and lower flow during [[diastole]])
* [[cardiomegaly]] (enlarged heart, reflecting [[ventricular dilation]] and [[volume overload]])
* left subclavicular thrill
* [[bounding pulse]]
* widened [[pulse pressure]]
* increased [[cardiac output]]
* increased [[systolic pressure]]
* [[Failure to thrive|poor growth]]<ref name=medlineplus>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001560.htm MedlinePlus - ''Patent ductus arteriosus''] Update Date: 21 December 2009</ref>
* differential [[cyanosis]], i.e. cyanosis of the lower extremities but not of the upper body.

People with ''patent ductus arteriosus'' typically present in good health, with normal respirations and heart rate. If the PDA is moderate or large, widened [[pulse pressure]] and bounding peripheral pulses are frequently present, reflecting increased left ventricular [[stroke volume]] and diastolic run-off of blood into the (initially lower-resistance) pulmonary vascular bed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-06 |title=Medically Sound: Critical Blood Flow Redirection and a Fetus under Pressure – Fetal Heart Defects |url=https://urmedlife.blogspot.com/2020/10/critical-flow-redirection-and-fetus.html |access-date=2020-11-01 |website=Medically Sound}}</ref> [[Eisenmenger's syndrome|Eisenmenger]] physiology is pulmonary hypertension due to a left-to-right shunt.

* [[Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder]]

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds.svg|thumb|Phonocardiograms from normal and abnormal heart sounds]]
PDA is usually diagnosed using [[Non-invasive technique|noninvasive techniques]]. [[Echocardiography]] (in which [[sound wave]]s are used to capture the motion of the heart) and associated [[Doppler ultrasonography|Doppler]] studies are the primary methods of detecting PDA. [[Electrocardiography]] (ECG), in which [[electrode]]s are used to record the [[electricity|electrical]] activity of the heart, is not particularly helpful as no specific rhythms or ECG patterns can be used to detect PDA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/patent-ductus-arteriosus/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20028530 |title=Tests and Diagnosis |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |date=16 December 2015 |access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref>

A chest [[X-ray]] may be taken, which reveals overall heart size (as a reflection of the combined mass of the cardiac chambers) and the appearance of blood flow to the lungs. A small PDA most often accompanies a normal-sized heart and normal blood flow to the lungs. A large PDA generally accompanies an enlarged [[Cardiac Silhouette|cardiac silhouette]] and increased blood flow to the lungs.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

== Prevention ==
Some evidence suggests that intravenous NSAIDs, such as [[indomethacin]], administration on the first day of life to all preterm infants reduces the risk of developing a PDA and the complications associated with PDA.<ref name=":0" /> Intravenous Indomethacin treatment in premature infants also may reduce the need for surgical intervention.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal| last=Fowlie| first=PW| author2=Davis PG | author3=McGuire W |title=Prophylactic intravenous indomethacin for preventing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants (Review)|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 May 2010| volume=2010|issue=7|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000174.pub2 |page=CD000174 | pmid=20614421| pmc=7045285}}</ref> Administering ibuprofen probably helps to prevent PDA and reduce the need for surgery but it also likely increases the risk of [[Oliguria|kidney complications]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ohlsson |first1=A |last2=Shah |first2=SS |title=Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=27 January 2020 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=CD004213 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004213.pub5 |pmid=31985838|pmc=6984616 }}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Symptomatic PDA can be treated with both [[surgery|surgical]] and non-surgical methods.<ref>Zahaka, KG and Patel, CR. "Congenital defects'". Fanaroff, AA and Martin, RJ (eds.). ''Neonatal-perinatal medicine: Diseases of the fetus and infant.'' 7th ed. (2002):1120–1139. St. Louis: Mosby.</ref>

=== Conservative ===
Neonates without adverse symptoms may simply be monitored as [[outpatient]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

=== Surgery ===
Surgically, the DA may be closed by ligation (though support in premature infants is mixed).<ref name="pmid20808624">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mosalli R, Alfaleh K, Paes B |title=Role of prophylactic surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus in extremely low birth weight infants: Systematic review and implications for clinical practice |journal=Ann Pediatr Cardiol |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=120–6 |date=July 2009 |pmid=20808624 |pmc=2922659 |doi=10.4103/0974-2069.58313 |doi-access=free }}</ref> This can either be performed manually and be tied shut, or with intravascular coils or plugs that leads to formation of a [[thrombus]] in the DA.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Devices developed by [[Franz Freudenthal]] block the blood vessel with woven structures of [[nitinol]] wire.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2014/10/141002_medico_boliviano_corazon_am|date=2014-10-02  |author=Alejandra Martins |title=The inventions of the Bolivian doctor who saved thousands of children|journal=BBC Mundo|access-date=2015-03-30}}</ref> Newer procedures performed effectively in older, bigger children include catheter PDA occlusion and video-assisted thoracoscopic PDA clipping.<ref>Hines MH, Bensky AS, Hammon JW Jr et al.

=== Prostaglandin inhibitors ===
Because [[prostaglandin E2]] is responsible for keeping the DA open, NSAIDs (which can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis) such as [[indomethacin]] or a special form of [[ibuprofen]] have been suggested as therapy to initiate PDA closure.<ref name=medlineplus/><ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/17/1873.full circ.ahajournals.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/patent-ductus-arteriosus/DS00631/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs MayoClinic > ''Patent ductus arteriosus'' (PDA).] 22 Dec. 2009</ref> Findings from a 2015 systematic review concluded that, for closure of a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin. It also causes fewer side effects (such as transient [[acute kidney injury]]) and reduces the risk of [[Necrotizing enterocolitis|necrotising enterocolitis]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ohlsson A, Walia R, Shah SS |title=Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants. |journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue = 2 |pages = CD003481 |year = 2015 |doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003481.pub6 |pmid=25692606 }}</ref> The evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is less clear.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ohlsson |first1=Arne |last2=Shah |first2=Prakeshkumar S. |date=2018-04-06 |title=Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight infants |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=CD010061 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010061.pub3 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=6494526 |pmid=29624206}}</ref> A review and meta-analysis showed that [[paracetamol]] may be effective for closure of a PDA in preterm infants.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Ohlsson |first1=Arne |last2=Shah |first2=Prakeshkumar S. |date=27 January 2020 |title=Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight infants |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=CD010061 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010061.pub4 |issn=1469-493X |pmc=6984659 |pmid=31985831}}</ref> A 2018 [[network meta-analysis]] that compared indomethacin, paracetamol and ibuprofen at different doses and administration schemes among them found that a high dose of oral ibuprofen may offer the highest likelihood of closure in preterm infants.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mitra |first1=Souvik |last2=Florez |first2=Ivan D. |last3=Tamayo |first3=Maria E. |last4=Mbuagbaw |first4=Lawrence |last5=Vanniyasingam |first5=Thuva |last6=Veroniki |first6=Areti Angeliki |last7=Zea |first7=Adriana M. |last8=Zhang |first8=Yuan |last9=Sadeghirad |first9=Behnam |date=2018-03-27 |title=Association of Placebo, Indomethacin, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen With Closure of Hemodynamically Significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants |journal=JAMA |language=en |volume=319 |issue=12 |pages=1221–1238 |doi=10.1001/jama.2018.1896 |pmid=29584842 |pmc=5885871 |issn=0098-7484}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last= |date=2018-07-03 |title=Oral ibuprofen may be an option for closing patent ductus arteriosus in premature babies |url=https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/oral-ibuprofen-may-be-an-option-for-closing-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-babies |journal=NIHR Evidence |type=Plain English summary |doi=10.3310/signal-000611|s2cid=240438747 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-06 |title=Medically Sound: Diagnosing and treating congenital heart defects |url=https://urmedlife.blogspot.com/2020/10/while-murmuring-is-underway-reading.html |access-date=2020-11-01 |website=Medically Sound}}</ref> However, a 2020 systematic review found that early (≤7 days of life) or very early (≤72 hours of life) pharmacological treatment of symptomatic PDA does not reduce death or other poor clinical outcomes in preterm infants but instead increases their exposure to NSAIDS.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mitra |first1=Souvik |last2=Scrivens |first2=Alexandra |last3=von Kursell |first3=Adelaide M |last4=Disher |first4=Tim |date=2020-12-10 |title=Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013278.pub2 |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2020 |issue=12 |pages=CD013278 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD013278.pub2 |pmid=33301630 |pmc=8812277 |s2cid=228100506 |issn=1465-1858}}</ref> Vasodilator therapy is suitable for people with Eisenmenger physiology. To assess improvement in people with Eisenmenger physiology, close monitory of toe oxygen saturation is required, for there exists a chance of reversal after a successful right-to-left shunt {{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

While [[indometacin]] can be used to close a PDA, some neonates require their PDA be kept open. Keeping a ''ductus arteriosus patent'' is indicated in neonates born with concurrent heart malformations, such as [[transposition of the great vessels]]. Drugs such as [[alprostadil]], a [[Prostaglandin E1|PGE-1]] analog, can be used to keep a PDA open until the primary defect is corrected surgically.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

== Prognosis ==
If left untreated, the disease may progress from left-to-right shunt ([[Acyanotic heart defect|acyanotic heart]]) to right-to-left shunt ([[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart]]), called [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]]. [[Pulmonary hypertension]] is a potential long-term outcome, which may require a heart and/or lung [[Organ transplantation|transplant]]. Another complication of PDA is [[intraventricular hemorrhage]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

==History==
[[Robert Edward Gross]], MD performed the first successful ligation of a ''patent ductus arteriosus'' on a seven-year-old girl at [[Children's Hospital Boston]] in 1938.<ref>[https://fa.hms.harvard.edu/files/memorialminute_gross_robert_e.pdf fa.hms.harvard.edu]; Robert E. Gross, Harvard Medical School Office for Faculty Affairs.</ref>

== Adult ==
Since PDA is usually identified in infants, it is less common in adults, but it can have serious consequences, and is usually corrected surgically upon diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
