'''Hemolytic anemia''' or '''haemolytic anaemia''' is a form of [[anemia]] due to [[hemolysis]], the abnormal breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs), either in the [[blood vessel]]s (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).<ref name=":07">{{Cite book|last=Capriotti, Theresa|title=Pathophysiology : introductory concepts and clinical perspectives|others=Frizzell, Joan Parker|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8036-1571-7|location=Philadelphia|oclc=900626405}}</ref> This most commonly occurs within the [[spleen]], but also can occur in the [[reticuloendothelial system]] or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage).<ref name=":07"/> Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias.<ref name=":07"/> It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects.<ref name=":07"/> The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/hemolytic-anemia|title=Hemolytic Anemia|last=Philadelphia|first=The Children's Hospital of|date=2014-03-30|website=chop.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Treatment depends on the type and cause of the hemolytic anemia.<ref name=":07"/>

==Mechanism==
In hemolytic anemia, there are two principal mechanisms of hemolysis; intravascular and extravascular.<ref>Dhaliwal G, Cornett PA, Tierney LM., Jr Hemolytic anemia. Am Fam Physician. 2004;69:2599–606. [PubMed] [Google Scholar]</ref>

=== Intravascular hemolysis ===
Intravascular hemolysis describes hemolysis that happens mainly inside the [[vasculature]].<ref name=":4">Stanley L Schrier, MD. William C Mentzer, MD, Jennifer S Tirnauer, MD (eds.).

Intravascular hemolysis may occur when red blood cells are targeted by [[Autoantibody|autoantibodies]], leading to [[Complement system|complement]] fixation, or by damage by parasites such as [[Babesia]].<ref name=":0">''"Bilirubin and hemolytic anemia". eClinpath. Retrieved 2019-05-08.''</ref>

=== Extravascular hemolysis ===
Extravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis taking place in the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[bone marrow]], and [[lymph nodes]].<ref name=":4" /> In this case little hemoglobin escapes into [[blood plasma]].<ref name=":5" /> The [[macrophages]] of the [[reticuloendothelial system]] in these organs [[Phagocytosis|engulf and destroy]] structurally-defective red blood cells, or those with antibodies attached, and release unconjugated bilirubin into the blood plasma circulation.<ref>''Rhodes, Carl E.; Varacallo, Matthew (2019-03-04).

If extravascular hemolysis is extensive, [[hemosiderin]] can be deposited in the spleen, bone marrow, kidney, liver, and other organs, resulting in [[hemosiderosis]].<ref name=":5" />

In a healthy person, a red blood cell survives 90 to 120 days in the circulation, so about 1% of human red blood cells break down each day.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Bosman|first=Giel J. C.

In conditions where the rate of RBC breakdown is increased, the body initially compensates by producing more RBCs; however, breakdown of RBCs can exceed the rate that the body can make RBCs, and so anemia can develop.<ref name=":2" /> [[Bilirubin]], a breakdown product of hemoglobin, can accumulate in the blood, causing [[jaundice]].<ref name=":0" />

The distinguishing feature of intravascular hemolysis is the release of RBC contents into the blood stream. The metabolism and elimination of these products, largely iron-containing compounds capable of doing damage through [[Fenton reaction]]s, <!--- ( unrelated to wikipedia [[Fenton Communications]]) ---> is an important part of the condition.

Free hemoglobin can bind to [[haptoglobin]], and the complex is cleared from the circulation; thus, a decrease in haptoglobin can support a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Alternatively, hemoglobin may oxidize and release the heme group that is able to bind to either albumin or hemopexin. The heme is ultimately converted to bilirubin and removed in stool and urine.<ref name=hillman1/> Hemoglobin may be cleared directly by the kidneys resulting in fast clearance of free hemoglobin but causing the continued loss of hemosiderin loaded renal tubular cells for many days.

Additional effects of free hemoglobin seem to be due to specific reactions with NO.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boretti FS, Buehler PW, D'Agnillo F, etal |title=Sequestration of extracellular hemoglobin within a haptoglobin complex decreases its hypertensive and oxidative effects in dogs and guinea pigs |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=2271–80 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19620788 |pmc=2719941 |doi=10.1172/JCI39115 |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/20201/1/Boretti_2009_JVIM_Comparison1.pdf |access-date=2018-10-31 |archive-date=2022-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220211025436/http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/20201/1/Boretti_2009_JVIM_Comparison1.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia can be suspected on the basis of a constellation of symptoms and is largely based on the presence of anemia, an increased proportion of immature red cells (reticulocytes) and a decrease in the level of haptoglobin, a protein that binds free hemoglobin. Examination of a [[peripheral blood smear]] and some other laboratory studies can contribute to the diagnosis. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include [[jaundice]] and dark colored urine due to the presence of [[hemoglobin]] ([[hemoglobinuria]]). When restricted to the morning hemoglobinuria may suggest [[paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria]]. Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a [[peripheral blood smear]] may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called [[schistocytes]], red blood cells that look like spheres ([[spherocytes]]), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces ([[bite cell]]s). An increased number of newly made red blood cells ([[reticulocytes]]) may also be a sign of [[bone marrow]] compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells, [[bilirubin]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase]], a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein [[haptoglobin]], and the direct [[Coombs test]] (also called direct antiglobulin test or DAT) to evaluate [[complement factor]]s and/or [[antibody|antibodies]] binding to red blood cells:<ref name=Algorithm/>

==Treatment==

Definitive therapy depends on the cause:
* Symptomatic treatment can be given by [[blood transfusion]], if there is marked anemia. A positive Coombs test is a relative contraindication to transfuse the patient. In cold hemolytic anemia there is advantage in transfusing warmed blood.
* In severe immune-related hemolytic anemia, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes necessary.
* In steroid resistant cases, consideration can be given to rituximab or addition of an immunosuppressant (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide).
* Association of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin  can control hemolysis in acute severe cases.
* Sometimes [[splenectomy]] can be helpful where extravascular hemolysis, or [[hereditary spherocytosis]], is predominant (i.e., most of the red blood cells are being removed by the spleen).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemolytic-anemias/ |title=Hemolytic Anemias, F.
