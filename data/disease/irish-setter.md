The '''Irish Setter''' ({{lang-ga|sotar rua}},<ref>[http://www.acmhainn.ie/tearmai/plandai.htm#II Ainmneacha Plandaí is Ainmhithe], accessed 14 June 2009.</ref> literally "'''red setter'''") is a [[setter]], a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[gundog]], and family [[dog]]. The term ''Irish Setter'' is commonly used to encompass the show-bred dog recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]] as well as the field-bred Red Setter recognised by the [[Field Dog Stud Book]].

==Description==

===Appearance===
[[File:Irish Setter in Tallinn 2.JPG|thumb|right|Irish Setter in a dog show.]]
The coat is moderately long, silky, and of a red or chestnut colour. It requires frequent brushing to maintain its condition and keep it mat-free.  The undercoat is abundant in winter weather, and the top coat is fine. Their coats should also feather in places such as the tail, ears, chest, legs, and body. Irish Setters range in height from {{convert|24|to|28|in|cm}}, males weigh {{convert|65|to|75|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|55|to|65|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The FCI Breed Standard for the Irish Setter stipulates males stand {{convert|23|to|26.5|in|cm}} tall, and females be {{convert|21.5|to|24.5|in|cm}} tall.
Irish Setters are deep chested dogs with small waists. An Irish Setter's life expectancy tends to be around 11 to 12 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breed Longevity Data|url=http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm|website=Dog Longevity|first=Kelly M.|last=Cassidy|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515154436/http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm|archive-date=2012-05-15|access-date=2012-06-27}}</ref>

===Temperament===
[[File:Irish setter head.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|Irish Setter head]]

Irish Setters get along well with children and other dogs and will greet visitors enthusiastically.  Even though they do well with household pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed.  Some Irish Setters may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too boisterous with small children.  As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be "Demonstrably affectionate."  As a result, Irish Setters make excellent companion animals and family pets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=2039|title=Breed Information Centre — Irish Setter|website=TheKennelClub.org.uk}}</ref>

Irish Setters are an active breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces.  They are, however, a breed with a tendency to 'play deaf,' so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead.

Irish Setters enjoy having a job to do. Lack of activity will lead to a bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. Irish Setters thrive on constant human companionship. Irish Setters respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.

Though they are usually alert to their surroundings, Irish Setters are not well-suited as [[guard dog]]s, as they are not a naturally assertive breed.

Irish Setters are also widely used as [[therapy dog]]s in schools and hospitals. Therapy dogs are permitted in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. In schools the dogs may be used to create a calming and relaxed environment. A child may read to a dog without being corrected or judged.

==History==
[[File:George Garrard - Ranger, a setter, the property of Elizabeth Gray - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The Irish Setter, in the beginning, was not identical to the breed today. The solid red colouring came about by selective breeding practices. Ranger, a Red Setter, the property of  Elizabeth Gray in 1797]] 
One of the first references to the 'Setter,' or setting dog, in literature can be found in Caius's ''De Canibus Britannicus'', which was published in 1570 (with a revised version published in 1576).  Translated from the original Latin, the text reads:
{{blockquote|The Dogge called the Setter, in Latine, Index: Another sort of Dogges be there, serviceable for fowling, making no noise either with foote or with tongue, whiles they follow the game.  They attend diligently upon their Master and frame their condition to such beckes, motions and gestures, as it shall please him to exhibite and make, either going forward, drawing backeward, inclinding to the right hand, or yealding toward the left.  When he hath founde the byrde, he keepeth sure and fast silence, he stayeth his steppes and will proceed no further, and weth a close, covert watching eye, layeth his belly to the grounde and so creepth forward like a worme.  When he approaches neere to the place where the byrde is, he layes him downe, and with a marcke of his pawes, betrayeth the place of the byrdes last abode, whereby it is supposed that this kind of dogge is calles in Index, Setter, being in deede a name most consonant and agreeable to his quality."<ref name="Gardner Today">Gardner, E. ''Irish Setters Today''; Ringpress Books Pty Ltd, 1998.</ref>}}
It would be incorrect to assume the dog described above in any way resembles the Irish Setter (or any setter) as we know the breed today. Caius was referring to a type of setting spaniel, most likely now extinct. The description of the work undertaken by this early pillar of the breed resembles the working behaviour of modern Irish Setters. Of this early dog, Caius went on to write: "The most part of theyre skinnes are white, and if they are marcked with any spottes, they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall." If this is the case, it is safe to assume the solid red colouring of today's Irish Setter came about by selective breeding practices.

Further reference to setters in early literature can be found in ''[[The Country Farme]]'' by Richard Surflet and [[Gervase Markham]], published in 1616.  They wrote: "There is also another sort of land spannyels which are called Setters."<ref name="Gardner Today" />

It is clear that, by the early 18th Century, the type of dog known as the 'setter' had come into its own right. It is also clear the Irish had begun actively breeding their own type. For example, the de Freyne family of French Park began keeping detailed stud records in 1793. Other prominent landed Irish gentry also known to have been breeding setter lines at the same time include Lord Clancarty, Lord Dillon, and the Marquis of Waterford.

It was noted as early as 1845 that setters in Ireland were predominantly either red, or, according to Youatt,<ref name="Gardner Today" /> "...very red, or red and white, or lemon coloured, or white patched with deep chestnut." Clearly, the preference for a solid red-coloured dog was having an effect on the appearance of the typical Irish-bred setter.

The breed standard for the modern Irish Setter was first drawn up by the Irish Red Setter Club in [[Dublin]] and approved on 29 March 1886. It consisted of a 100-point scale, with a given number of points awarded for each of the dog's physical attributes. The points system was later dropped; however, aside from some minor changes, the standard remains largely unchanged today in most countries where the breed is formally recognised.

==Uses==
[[File:Irishsetteronpoint.JPG|thumb|left|Irish Setter pointing]]
The Irish Setter was bred for hunting, specifically for setting or locating and [[Pointing dog|pointing]] upland [[gamebird]]s. They are a tireless, wide-ranging hunter, and well-suited to fields and wet or dry moorland terrain. Using their excellent sense of smell to locate the mark (or bird), the Irish Setter will then hold a pointing position, indicating the direction in which the bird lies hidden.

The Irish Setter was brought to the United States in the early 19th century.

In 1874, the American Field put together the [[Field Dog Stud Book]] and registry of dogs in the United States was born. This Field Dog Stud Book is the oldest pure-bred registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of [[English Setter]] and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red Irish Setter became a favourite in the dog show ring.

Not all Irish Setters of the late 19th century were red, the American Kennel Club registered Irish Setters in a myriad of colours. Frank Forester, a 19th-century sports writer, described the Irish Setter as follows: "The points of the Irish Setter are more bony, angular, and wiry frame, a longer head, a less silky and straighter coat that those of the English. His colour ought to be a deep orange-red and white, a common mark is a stripe of white between the eyes and a white ring around the neck, white stockings, and a white tage to the tail."

The Setter that was completely red, however, was preferred in the show ring and that is the direction that the breed took. Between 1874 and 1948, the breed produced 760 [[conformation show]] champions, but only five field champions.

In the 1940s, ''[[Field and Stream]]'' magazine put into writing what was already a well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing from the field and an [[outcross]] would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a [[working dog]]. ''Sports Afield'' chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the [[Field Dog Stud Book]], he began an outcross to red and white field champion [[English Setter]]s. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.

Prior to 1975, a relationship existed between the American Kennel Club and the Field Dog Stud Book in which registration with one body qualified a dog for registration with the other. In 1975 the Irish Setter Club of America petitioned the American Kennel Club to deny reciprocal registration, and the request was granted. It is claimed, by critics of the move, that the pressure was placed on the American Kennel Club by bench show enthusiasts who were unappreciative of the outcrossing efforts of the National Red Setter Field Trial Club, as well as some field trialers from the American Kennel Club after a series of losses to Field Dog Stud book red setters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1978/11/20/823060/irish-with-a-dash-of-limey-the-stylish-red-setter-which-is-fast-gaining-popularity-in-the-field-is-mostly-irish-and-a-small-part-english|title=Irish with a dash of Limey|first=Robert H.|last=Boyle|website=Sports Illustrated (Vault)|date=November 20, 1978}}</ref> Working Irish Setter kennels today field champion dogs that claim lines from both the Field Dog Stud Book and the American Kennel Club.

===Working Red Setter===
The modern Red Setter is smaller than its bench-bred cousin. While show dogs often reach 70&nbsp;lb (32&nbsp;kg), the Working Red Setter is generally around {{convert|45|lb|abbr=on}}. The coat is less silky and the feathering is generally shorter. The colour is lighter, with the working dog found in russet and fawn colours. The Red Setter often has patches of white on its face and chest as the Irish Setter of old did. There have been efforts to rekindle the field abilities of the true type Irish by a handful of dedicated breeders in California and elsewhere with some success.  More than a dozen American Kennel Club Dual Champion Irish Setters have been made, evidence of the dog's native ability when proper traits are selectively sought in breeding.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Gluten intolerance in Irish Setters is a naturally occurring genetic disorder that is the result of a single autosomal recessive locus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Garden|first1=Oliver A|last2=Pidduck|display-authors=1|date=2000|title=Inheritance of gluten-sensitive enteropathy in Irish Setters|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=61|issue=4|pages=462–468|doi=10.2460/ajvr.2000.61.462|pmid=10772115|url=http://researchonline.rvc.ac.uk/id/eprint/6890/ |doi-access=free}}</ref>&nbsp;At around 6 months of age, Irish Setters with this condition will develop an increased immune cell presence and a decrease in absorption within the small intestine when fed a gluten containing diet.
