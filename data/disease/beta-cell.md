=== Type 1 diabetes===
[[Type 1 diabetes mellitus]], also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is believed to be caused by an auto-immune mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the body.<ref name="Fu_2013" /> The process of beta-cell destruction begins with insulitis activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs). APCs then trigger activation of CD4+ helper-T cells and chemokines/cytokines release. Then, the cytokines activate CD8+ cytotoxic–T cells which leads to beta-cell destruction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita T | title = Apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells in Type 1 diabetes | journal = Bosnian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–193 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28368239 | pmc = 5581966 | doi = 10.17305/bjbms.2017.1961 }}</ref> The destruction of these cells reduces the body's ability to respond to glucose levels in the body, therefore making it nearly impossible to properly regulate glucose and glucagon levels in the bloodstream.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eizirik DL, Mandrup-Poulsen T | title = A choice of death--the signal-transduction of immune-mediated beta-cell apoptosis | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 44 | issue = 12 | pages = 2115–2133 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11793013 | doi = 10.1007/s001250100021 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The body destroys 70–80% of beta cells, leaving only 20–30% of functioning cells.<ref name="Chen_2017" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Butler AE, Galasso R, Meier JJ, Basu R, Rizza RA, Butler PC | title = Modestly increased beta cell apoptosis but no increased beta cell replication in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients who died of diabetic ketoacidosis | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 50 | issue = 11 | pages = 2323–2331 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17805509 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-007-0794-x | doi-access = free }}</ref> This can cause the patient to experience hyperglycemia, which leads to other adverse short-term and long-term conditions.<ref name="Ciechanowski_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciechanowski PS, Katon WJ, Russo JE, Hirsch IB | title = The relationship of depressive symptoms to symptom reporting, self-care and glucose control in diabetes | journal = General Hospital Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 246–252 | date = July–August 2003 | pmid = 12850656 | doi = 10.1016/s0163-8343(03)00055-0 }}</ref> The symptoms of diabetes can potentially be controlled with methods such as regular doses of insulin and sustaining a proper diet.<ref name="Ciechanowski_2003" /> However, these methods can be tedious and cumbersome to continuously perform on a daily basis.<ref name="Ciechanowski_2003" />

[[Insulinoma]] is a rare tumor derived from the neoplasia of beta cells. Insulinomas are usually [[benign]], but may be medically significant and even life-threatening due to recurrent and prolonged attacks of [[hypoglycemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu R, Nissen NN, Hendifar A, Tang L, Song YL, Chen YJ, Fan X | title = A Clinicopathological Study of Malignant Insulinoma in a Contemporary Series | journal = Pancreas | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–56 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27984486 | doi = 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000718 | s2cid = 3723691 }}</ref>

== Research==
=== Experimental techniques===
Many researchers around the world are investigating the pathogenesis of diabetes and beta-cell failure. Tools used to study beta-cell function are expanding rapidly with technology.

For instance, transcriptomics have allowed researchers to comprehensively analyze gene transcription in beta-cells to look for genes linked to diabetes.<ref name="Chen_2017" /> A more common mechanism of analyzing cellular function is calcium imaging.

In order to successfully re-create functional insulin producing beta cells, studies have shown that manipulating cell-signal pathways in early stem cell development will lead to those stem cells differentiating into viable beta cells.<ref name="Afelik_2017" /><ref name="Mahla_2016" /> Two key signal pathways have been shown to play a vital role in the differentiation of stem cells into beta cells: the BMP4 pathway and the kinase C.<ref name="Mahla_2016" /> Targeted manipulation of these two pathways has shown that it is possible to induce beta cell differentiation from stem cells.<ref name="Mahla_2016" /> These variations of artificial beta cells have shown greater levels of success in replicating the functionality of natural beta cells, although the replication has not been perfectly re-created yet.<ref name="Mahla_2016" />

Studies have shown that it is possible to regenerate beta cells ''in vivo'' in some animal models.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeon K, Lim H, Kim JH, Thuan NV, Park SH, Lim YM, Choi HY, Lee ER, Kim JH, Lee MS, Cho SG | display-authors = 6 | title = Differentiation and transplantation of functional pancreatic beta cells generated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a type 1 diabetes mouse model | journal = Stem Cells and Development | volume = 21 | issue = 14 | pages = 2642–2655 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22512788 | pmc = 3438879 | doi = 10.1089/scd.2011.0665 }}</ref> Research in mice has shown that beta cells can often regenerate to the original quantity number after the beta cells have undergone some sort of stress test, such as the intentional destruction of the beta cells in the mice subject or once the auto-immune response has concluded.<ref name="Afelik_2017" /> While these studies have conclusive results in mice, beta cells in human subjects may not possess this same level of versatility. Investigation of beta cells following acute onset of Type 1 diabetes has shown little to no proliferation of newly synthesized beta cells, suggesting that human beta cells might not be as versatile as rat beta cells, but there is actually no comparison that can be made here because healthy (non-diabetic) rats were used to prove that beta cells can proliferate after intentional destruction of beta cells, while diseased (type-1 diabetic) humans were used in the study which was attempted to use as evidence against beta cells regenerating.<ref>Lam, Carol & Jacobson, Daniel & Rankin, Matthew & Cox, Aaron & Kushner, Jake.

It appears that much work has to be done in the field of regenerating beta cells.<ref name="Mahla_2016">

An unlimited amount of beta cells produced artificially could potentially provide therapy to many of the patients who are affected by Type 1 diabetes.

=== Type 2 diabetes===
Research focused on non insulin dependent diabetes encompasses many areas of interest. Degeneration of the beta cell as diabetes progresses has been a broadly reviewed topic.<ref name="Chen_2017" /><ref name="Boland_2017" /><ref name="Fu_2013" /> Another topic of interest for beta-cell physiologists is the mechanism of insulin pulsatility which has been well investigated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nunemaker CS, Bertram R, Sherman A, Tsaneva-Atanasova K, Daniel CR, Satin LS | title = Glucose modulates [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic islets via ionic and glycolytic mechanisms | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 2082–2096 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16815907 | pmc = 1557567 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.106.087296 | bibcode = 2006BpJ....91.2082N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertram R, Sherman A, Satin LS | title = Metabolic and electrical oscillations: partners in controlling pulsatile insulin secretion | journal = American Journal of Physiology.
