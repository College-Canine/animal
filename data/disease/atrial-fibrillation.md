==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Atrial fib stroke.jpg|thumb|How a stroke can occur during atrial fibrillation]]
AF is usually accompanied by symptoms related to a rapid heart rate. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as [[palpitations|the sensation of the heart beating too fast, irregularly, or skipping beats (palpitations)]] or [[exercise intolerance]] and occasionally may produce [[angina pectoris|anginal chest pain]] (if the high heart rate causes [[ischemia|the heart's demand for oxygen to increase beyond the supply of available oxygen]]). Other possible symptoms include [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] symptoms such as fatigue, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or [[edema|swelling]]. [[Unconsciousness|Loss of consciousness]] can also occur on atrial fibrillations due to lack of oxygen and blood to the brain. The [[heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)]] is sometimes only identified with the onset of a [[stroke]] or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA). It is not uncommon for a person to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or [[electrocardiogram]], as it often does not cause symptoms.<ref name=AHA2006/>

Since most cases of AF are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of [[chest pain]] or [[angina]], signs and symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] (an overactive [[thyroid gland]]) such as [[weight loss]] and [[diarrhea]], and symptoms suggestive of [[lung disease]] can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[heart failure]], or [[rheumatic fever]], may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications.<ref name=AHA2006/>

===Rapid heart rate===
Presentation is similar to other forms of [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]] and may be asymptomatic. [[Palpitations]] and chest discomfort are common complaints.  The rapid uncoordinated heart rate may result in reduced [[cardiac output|output of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output)]], resulting in inadequate blood flow, and therefore oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. Common symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation may include [[shortness of breath]], [[orthopnea|shortness of breath when lying flat]], dizziness, and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea|sudden onset of shortness of breath during the night]]. This may progress to [[peripheral edema|swelling of the lower extremities]], a manifestation of congestive heart failure. Due to inadequate cardiac output, individuals with AF may also complain of [[lightheadedness]].<ref name="Gutierrez2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutierrez C, Blanchard DG | title = Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and treatment | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–68 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21888129 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html | url-status = live | type = Review | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120005/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html | archive-date = 24 December 2013 }}</ref>

AF can cause [[respiratory distress]] due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, the heart rate will be [[tachycardia|greater than 100 beats per minute]]. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) [[sphygmomanometer|non-invasive blood pressure]] monitors. For this reason, when determining the heart rate in AF, direct cardiac [[auscultation]] is recommended. [[hypotension|Low blood pressure]] is most concerning, and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation of congestive heart failure due to the reduced cardiac output. The affected person's respiratory rate often increases in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of [[hypoxia (medical)|too little oxygen reaching the body's tissues]], related to any precipitating factors such as [[pneumonia]]. Examination of the [[jugular vein]]s may reveal elevated [[jugular venous pressure|pressure]] (jugular venous distention). Examination of the lungs may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of [[pulmonary edema]]. Examination of the heart will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

* Familial AF presenting in the setting of another inherited cardiac disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], [[familial amyloidosis]])
* Inherited arrhythmic syndromes (congenital [[long QT syndrome]], [[short QT syndrome]], [[Brugada syndrome]])
* Non-familial AF associated with genetic backgrounds (polymorphism in the ACE gene) that may predispose to atrial fibrillation

Family history in a first degree relative is associated with a 40% increase in risk of AF.

===Alcohol===
Acute alcohol consumption can directly trigger an episode of atrial fibrillation.<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/> Regular alcohol consumption also increases the risk of atrial fibrillation in several ways.<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/>  The long-term use of alcohol alters the physical structure and electrical properties of the atria.<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/>  Alcohol consumption does this by repeatedly stimulating the [[sympathetic nervous system]], increasing [[inflammation]] in the atria, raising [[hypertension|blood pressure]], lowering the levels of [[Hypokalemia|potassium]] and [[Hypomagnesemia|magnesium]] in the blood, worsening [[obstructive sleep apnea]], and by promoting harmful structural changes (remodeling) in the atria and [[Left ventricular hypertrophy|ventricles of the heart]].<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/> This remodeling leads to abnormally increased pressure in the left atrium, inappropriately dilates it, and increases [[fibrosis|scarring (fibrosis)]] in the left atrium.<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/> The aforementioned structural changes increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation when paired with the harmful changes in how the left atrium conducts electricity.<ref name="Voskoboinik2016"/>

=== High blood pressure ===
According to the CHARGE Consortium, both systolic and diastolic [[blood pressure]] are predictors of the risk of AF. Systolic blood pressure values close to normal limit the increase in the risk associated with AF. Diastolic dysfunction is also associated with AF, which increases left atrial pressure, left atrial volume, size, and left ventricular hypertrophy, characteristic of chronic hypertension. All atrial remodeling is related to heterogeneous conduction and the formation of re-entrant electric conduction from the [[pulmonary veins]].<ref name="Staerk" /><ref name="Alonso">{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso A, Krijthe BP, Aspelund T, Stepas KA, Pencina MJ, Moser CB, Sinner MF, Sotoodehnia N, Fontes JD, Janssens AC, Kronmal RA, Magnani JW, Witteman JC, Chamberlain AM, Lubitz SA, Schnabel RB, Agarwal SK, McManus DD, Ellinor PT, Larson MG, Burke GL, Launer LJ, Hofman A, Levy D, Gottdiener JS, Kääb S, Couper D, Harris TB, Soliman EZ, Stricker BH, Gudnason V, Heckbert SR, Benjamin EJ | title = Simple risk model predicts incidence of atrial fibrillation in a racially and geographically diverse population: the CHARGE-AF consortium | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = e000102 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23537808 | pmc = 3647274 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.112.000102 }}</ref>

=== Other diseases ===
There is a relationship between risk factors such as [[obesity]] and hypertension, with the appearance of diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, specifically, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

==Pathophysiology==
The normal [[electrical conduction system of the heart]] allows electrical impulses generated by the heart's own pacemaker (the [[sinoatrial node]]) to spread to and stimulate the muscular layer of the heart ([[myocardium]]) in both the atria and the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. When the myocardium is stimulated it contracts, and if this occurs in an orderly manner allows blood to be pumped to the body. In AF, the normal regular electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial node are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical waves, usually originating from the roots of the [[pulmonary veins]]. These disorganized waves conduct intermittently through the [[atrioventricular node]], leading to irregular activation of the ventricles that generate the heartbeat.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Pathology===
The primary pathologic change seen in atrial fibrillation is the progressive [[fibrosis]] of the atria. This fibrosis is due primarily to atrial dilation; however, genetic causes and inflammation may be factors in some individuals. Dilation of the atria can be due to almost any structural abnormality of the heart that can cause a rise in the pressure within the heart. This includes [[valvular heart disease]] (such as [[mitral stenosis]], [[mitral regurgitation]], and [[tricuspid regurgitation]]), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria. This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against [[myosin]] heavy chains. Mutation of the ''[[lamin]] AC'' gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Once dilation of the atria has occurred, this begins a chain of events that leads to the activation of the [[renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system]] (RAAS) and subsequent increase in the matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s and [[disintegrin]], which leads to atrial remodeling and fibrosis, with loss of atrial muscle mass. This process occurs gradually, and experimental studies have revealed patchy atrial fibrosis may precede the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of atrial fibrillation.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Fibrosis is not limited to the muscle mass of the atria and may occur in the [[sinus node]] (SA node) and [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node), correlating with [[sick sinus syndrome]]. Prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation have been shown to correlate with prolongation of the sinus node recovery time;<ref name=AHA2006/> this suggests that dysfunction of the SA node is progressive with prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Along with fibrosis, alterations in the atria that predispose to atrial fibrillation affect their [[electrophysiology|electrical]] properties, as well as their responsiveness to the [[autonomic nervous system]]. The atrial [[Cardiac remodeling|remodeling]] that includes the pathologic changes described above has been referred to as ''atrial myopathy''.<ref name="pmid31768479">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shen MJ, Arora R, Jalife J | title = Atrial Myopathy | journal = JACC.

There are multiple theories about the cause of atrial fibrillation. An important theory is that the regular impulses produced by the sinus node for a normal heartbeat are overwhelmed by rapid electrical discharges produced in the atria and adjacent parts of the [[pulmonary veins]]. Sources of these disturbances are either automatic foci, often localized at one of the pulmonary veins, or a small number of localized sources in the form of either a re-entrant leading circle or electrical spiral waves (rotors); these localized sources may be in the left atrium near the pulmonary veins or in a variety of other locations through both the left or right atrium. Three fundamental components favor the establishment of a leading circle or a rotor: slow conduction velocity of the [[cardiac action potential]], a short [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and a small [[wavelength]]. Meanwhile, the wavelength is the product of velocity and refractory period. If the action potential has fast conduction, with a long refractory period and/or conduction pathway shorter than the wavelength, an AF focus would not be established. In multiple wavelet theory, a wavefront will break into smaller daughter wavelets when encountering an obstacle, through a process called vortex shedding. But, under the proper conditions, such wavelets can reform and spin around a center, forming an AF focus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waks JW, Josephson ME | title = Mechanisms of Atrial Fibrillation - Reentry, Rotors and Reality | journal = Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 90–100 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 26835073 | pmc = 4711504 | doi = 10.15420/aer.2014.3.2.90 }}</ref>

In a heart with AF, the increased calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] and increased calcium sensitivity can lead to an accumulation of intracellular calcium and causes downregulation of [[L-type calcium channel]]s. This reduces the duration of action potential and the refractory period, thus favoring the conduction of re-entrant waves. Increased expression of [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]]s can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of [[gap junction protein]]s such as [[GJA1]] (also known as Connexin 43), and [[GJA5]] (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing the arrhythmia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pellman J, Sheikh F | title = Atrial fibrillation: mechanisms, therapeutics, and future directions | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 649–665 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25880508 | pmc = 5240842 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c140047 | isbn = 978-0-470-65071-4 }}</ref>

AF can be distinguished from [[atrial flutter]] (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic saw-toothed F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly at a rate of 300&nbsp;beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no such regularity, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.  Although AF and atrial flutter are distinct arrhythmias, atrial flutter may degenerate into AF, and an individual may experience both arrhythmias at different times.<ref name=Bun2015 />

Although the electrical impulses of AF occur at a high rate, most of them do not result in a heartbeat. A heartbeat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the [[Atrioventricular node|atrioventricular (AV) node]] to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe [[ventricular tachycardia]], resulting in a severe reduction of [[cardiac output]]. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.<ref name='Klabunde2005'>{{cite book | vauthors = Klabunde R |title = Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year = 2005 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/cardiovascularph00klab_564/page/n24 25], 28 |url =https://archive.org/details/cardiovascularph00klab_564|url-access = limited |isbn = 978-0-7817-5030-1 }}</ref>

===Minimal evaluation===
In general, the minimal evaluation of atrial fibrillation should be performed in all individuals with AF. The goal of this evaluation is to determine the general treatment regimen for the individual. If the results of the general evaluation warrant it, further studies may then be performed.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

====History and physical examination====
The history of the individual's atrial fibrillation episodes is probably the most important part of the evaluation. Distinctions should be made between those who are entirely asymptomatic when they are in AF (in which case the AF is found as an incidental finding on an ECG or physical examination) and those who have gross and obvious symptoms due to AF and can pinpoint whenever they go into AF or revert to sinus rhythm.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

====Routine bloodwork====
While many cases of AF have no definite cause, it may be the result of various other problems. Hence, [[kidney function]] and [[electrolyte]]s are routinely determined, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone (commonly suppressed in [[hyperthyroidism]] and of relevance if [[amiodarone]] is administered for treatment) and a [[complete blood count|blood count]].<ref name=AHA2006/>

In acute-onset AF associated with [[chest pain]], [[troponin|cardiac troponins]], or other markers of damage to the heart muscle may be ordered. [[Coagulation]] studies ([[International normalized ratio|INR]]/aPTT) are usually performed, as [[anticoagulant]] medication may be commenced.<ref name=AHA2006/>

====Electrocardiogram====
[[File:Atrial Fibrillation.png|thumb|ECG recordings of normal sinus rhythm (top) with atrial fibrillation and absence of P waves (bottom)]]

Atrial fibrillation is diagnosed on an electrocardiogram (ECG), an investigation performed routinely whenever an irregular heartbeat is suspected. Characteristic findings are the absence of P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R–R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles.<ref name=AHA2006/> At very fast heart rates, atrial fibrillation may look more regular, which may make it more difficult to separate from other [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s or [[ventricular tachycardia]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Issa ZF, Miller JM, Zipes DP |title = Clinical arrhythmology and electrophysiology: a companion to Braunwald's heart disease |year = 2009 |publisher = Saunders |location = Philadelphia |isbn = 978-1-4160-5998-1 |page = 221 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908144250/https://books.google.com/books?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |archive-date = 8 September 2017 }}</ref>

[[QRS complex]]es should be narrow, signifying that they are initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|intraventricular conduction system]]. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for ventricular tachycardia, although, in cases where there is a disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-fib with a rapid ventricular response.

If paroxysmal AF is suspected, but an ECG during an office visit shows only a regular rhythm, AF episodes may be detected and documented with the use of ambulatory [[Holter monitor]]ing (e.g., for a day). If the episodes are too infrequent to be detected by Holter monitoring with reasonable probability, then the person can be monitored for longer periods (e.g., a month) with an ambulatory [[cardiac event monitor|event monitor]].<ref name=AHA2006/>

====Echocardiography====
In general, a non-invasive transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) is performed in newly diagnosed AF, as well as if there is a major change in the person's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify [[valvular heart disease]] (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke and alter recommendations for the appropriate type of anticoagulation), left and right atrial size (which predicts the likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.<ref name=AHA2006/>

Significant enlargement of both the left and right atria is associated with long-standing atrial fibrillation and, if noted at the initial presentation of atrial fibrillation, suggests that the atrial fibrillation is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Extended evaluation===
In general, an extended evaluation is not necessary for most individuals with atrial fibrillation and is performed only if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.

====Chest X-ray====
In general, a [[chest X-ray]] is performed only if a pulmonary cause of atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if other cardiac conditions are suspected (in particular [[congestive heart failure]]). This may reveal an underlying problem in the lungs or the blood vessels in the chest.<ref name=AHA2006/> In particular, if underlying pneumonia is suggested, then treatment of the pneumonia may cause the atrial fibrillation to terminate on its own.

====Transesophageal echocardiogram====
A regular echocardiogram ([[Transthoracic echocardiogram|transthoracic echo/TTE]]) has a low sensitivity for identifying [[thrombus|blood clots]] in the heart. If this is suspected (e.g., when planning urgent electrical cardioversion), a [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echocardiogram/TEE]] (or TOE where British spelling is used) is preferred.<ref name=AHA2006/>

If a blood clot is seen on TEE, then cardioversion is contraindicated due to the risk of stroke, and anticoagulation is recommended.

====Ambulatory Holter monitoring====
A [[Holter monitor]] is a wearable ambulatory heart monitor that continuously monitors the heart rate and heart rhythm for a short duration, typically 24 hours. In individuals with symptoms of significant shortness of breath with exertion or palpitations regularly, a Holter monitor may be of benefit to determine whether rapid heart rates (or unusually slow heart rates) during atrial fibrillation are the cause of the symptoms.

====Exercise stress testing====
Some individuals with atrial fibrillation do well with normal activity but develop shortness of breath with exertion. It may be unclear whether the shortness of breath is due to a blunted heart rate response to exertion caused by excessive [[atrioventricular node]]-blocking agents, a very rapid heart rate during exertion, or other underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or coronary ischemia. An [[cardiac stress test|exercise stress test]] will evaluate the individual's heart rate response to exertion and determine whether the AV node blocking agents are contributing to the symptoms.

The [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC), [[American Heart Association]] (AHA), and the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) recommend in their guidelines the following classification system based on simplicity and clinical relevance.<ref name=":0" />

All people with AF are initially in the category called ''first detected AF''. These people may or may not have had previous undetected episodes. If a first detected episode stops on its own in less than seven days and then another episode begins, later on, the category changes to ''paroxysmal AF''. Although people in this category have episodes lasting up to seven days, in most cases of paroxysmal AF, the episodes will stop in less than 24&nbsp;hours. If the episode lasts for more than seven days, it is unlikely to stop on its own and is then known as ''persistent AF''. In this case, [[cardioversion]] can be attempted to restore a normal rhythm. If an episode continues for a year or more, the rhythm is then known as ''longstanding persistent AF''.  If a decision is made by the person and their medical team to accept persistent AF and not attempt restoration of a normal sinus rhythm but instead manage the AF by simply controlling the person's ventricular rate then the rhythm is referred to as ''permanent AF''.  As a further subtype,  AF that is detected only by an implanted or wearable cardiac monitor is known as s''ubclinical AF.''<ref name=":0" />

Episodes that last less than 30&nbsp;seconds are not considered in this classification system. Also, this system does not apply to cases where the AF is a secondary condition that occurs in the setting of a primary condition that may be the cause of the AF.

About half of people with AF have permanent AF, while a quarter have paroxysmal AF, and a quarter have persistent AF.<ref name=Zoni2014/>

In addition to the above AF categories, which are mainly defined by episode timing and termination, the ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines describe additional AF categories in terms of other characteristics of the person.<ref name=":0" /> ''Valvular AF'' refers to AF attributable to moderate to severe [[mitral valve stenosis]] or atrial fibrillation in the presence of a [[Mechanical heart valve|mechanical artificial heart valve]].<ref name="January2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = January CT, Wann LS, Calkins H, Chen LY, Cigarroa JE, Cleveland JC, Ellinor PT, Ezekowitz MD, Field ME, Furie KL, Heidenreich PA, Murray KT, Shea JB, Tracy CM, Yancy CW | title = 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Heart Rhythm | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = e66–e93 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30703530 | doi = 10.1016/j.hrthm.2019.01.024 | type = Review | doi-access = free }}</ref> This distinction may be useful as it has implications on appropriate treatment, including differing recommendations for anticoagulation, but the most recent guidelines discourage use of this term as it may be confusing.<ref name=":0" />  Other historically used definitions include ''lone AF'' – AF occurring in those aged under 60 in the absence of other cardiovascular or respiratory diseases.  This description is also discouraged as it is recognised that AF always has an underlying cause.<ref name=":0" />  S''econdary AF'' refers to AF that occurs in the setting of another condition that have caused the AF, such as [[acute myocardial infarction]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[pericarditis]], [[myocarditis]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pneumonia]], or another acute pulmonary disease.

==Prevention==
Prevention of atrial fibrillation focuses primarily on preventing or controlling its risk factors. Many of its risk factors, such as [[obesity]], [[smoking]], lack of physical activity, and [[alcohol use disorder|excessive alcohol consumption]], are modifiable and preventable with lifestyle modification or can be managed by a healthcare professional.<ref name="Gorenek2017" />

===Lifestyle modification===
Several healthy lifestyle behaviors are associated with a lower likelihood of developing atrial fibrillation. Accordingly, consensus guidelines recommend abstaining from alcohol and recreational drugs, stopping tobacco use, maintaining a healthy weight, and regularly participating in moderate-intensity physical activities.<ref name="Gorenek2017"/> Consistent moderate-intensity [[aerobic exercise]], defined as achieving 3.0–5.9 [[Metabolic equivalent of task#Exercise guidelines|METs]] of intensity, for at least 150 minutes per week may reduce the risk of developing new-onset atrial fibrillation.<ref name="Chung2020"/> Few studies have examined the role of specific dietary changes and how it relates to the prevention of atrial fibrillation.<ref name="Gorenek2017"/>

==Management==
{{Main|Management of atrial fibrillation}}
The main goals of treatment are to prevent [[Shock (circulatory)|circulatory instability]] and [[stroke]]. Rate or rhythm control is used to achieve the former, whereas [[anticoagulation]] is used to decrease the risk of the latter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prystowsky EN, Padanilam BJ, Fogel RI | title = Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation | journal = JAMA | volume = 314 | issue = 3 | pages = 278–288 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26197188 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2015.7505 | s2cid = 205070036 }}</ref> If cardiovascularly unstable due to uncontrolled [[tachycardia]], immediate [[cardioversion]] is indicated.<ref name=AHA2006/> Many [[antiarrhythmics]], when used long term, increase the risk of death without any meaningful benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valembois L, Audureau E, Takeda A, Jarzebowski W, Belmin J, Lafuente-Lafuente C | title = Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2019 | issue = 9 | pages = CD005049 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31483500 | pmc = 6738133 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005049.pub5 }}</ref> An integrated management approach, which includes stroke prevention, symptoms control and management of associated comorbidities has been associated with better outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Romiti GF, Pastori D, Rivera-Caravaca JM, Ding WY, Gue YX, Menichelli D, Gumprecht J, Kozieł M, Yang PS, Guo Y, Lip GY, Proietti M | title = Adherence to the 'Atrial Fibrillation Better Care' Pathway in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Impact on Clinical Outcomes-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 285,000 Patients | journal = Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 122 | issue = 3 | pages = 406–414 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 34020488 | doi = 10.1055/A-1515-9630 | hdl-access = free | doi-access = free | hdl = 2434/887644 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Proietti M, Romiti GF, Olshansky B, Lane DA, Lip GY | title = Improved Outcomes by Integrated Care of Anticoagulated Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Using the Simple ABC (Atrial Fibrillation Better Care) Pathway | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 131 | issue = 11 | pages = 1359–1366.e6 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30153428 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2018.06.012 | s2cid = 52114134 | url = http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/54246094/Proietti_et_al_Improved_outcomes_by_intergrated_The_American_Journal_of_Medicine_2018.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Proietti M, Romiti GF, Olshansky B, Lane DA, Lip GY | title = Comprehensive Management With the ABC (Atrial Fibrillation Better Care) Pathway in Clinically Complex Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Post Hoc Ancillary Analysis From the AFFIRM Trial | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e014932 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32370588 | pmc = 7660878 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.119.014932 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pastori D, Pignatelli P, Menichelli D, Violi F, Lip GY | title = Integrated Care Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Risk of Cardiovascular Events: The ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) Pathway in the ATHERO-AF Study Cohort | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 94 | issue = 7 | pages = 1261–1267 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 30551910 | doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.10.022 | s2cid = 54623946 }}</ref>

* A: Avoid stroke with Anticoagulation, where the default is stroke prevention unless the patient is at low risk. Stroke prevention means use of oral anticoagulation (OAC), whether with well managed vitamin K antagonists (VKA), with time in therapeutic range >70%, or more commonly, label-adherent dosed direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).
* B: Better symptom and atrial fibrillation management with patient-centred, symptom directed decisions on rate control or rhythm control. In some selected patients, use early rhythm control may be beneficial.
* C: Cardiovascular risk factor and comorbidity management, including attention to lifestyle factors and psychological morbidity.

===Lifestyle modification===
Regular aerobic exercise improves atrial fibrillation symptoms and AF-related [[quality of life]].<ref name="Chung2020"/> The effect of [[high-intensity interval training]] on reducing atrial fibrillation burden is unclear.<ref name="Chung2020"/> Weight loss of at least 10% is associated with reduced atrial fibrillation burden in people who are overweight or obese.<ref name="Chung2020"/>

===Comorbidity treatment===
For people who have both atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea, observational studies suggest that [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) treatment appears to lower the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after undergoing ablation.<ref name="Chung2020"/> [[Randomized controlled trial]]s examining the role of obstructive sleep apnea treatment on atrial fibrillation incidence and burden are lacking.<ref name="Chung2020"/> Guideline-recommended lifestyle and medical interventions are recommended for people with atrial fibrillation and coexisting conditions such as [[hyperlipidemia]], diabetes mellitus, or hypertension without specific blood sugar or blood pressure targets for people with atrial fibrillation.<ref name="Chung2020"/>

[[Bariatric surgery]] may reduce the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation in people with obesity without AF and may reduce the risk of a recurrence of AF after an ablation procedure in people with coexisting obesity and atrial fibrillation.<ref name="Chung2020"/> It is important for all people with atrial fibrillation to optimize the control of all coexisting medical conditions that can worsen their atrial fibrillation, such as [[hyperthyroidism]], [[diabetes]], [[congestive heart failure]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma A, Kalman JM, Callans DJ | title = Treatment of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction | journal = Circulation | volume = 135 | issue = 16 | pages = 1547–1563 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28416525 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.026054 | s2cid = 207646320 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[hypertension|high blood pressure]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verdecchia P, Angeli F, Reboldi G | title = Hypertension and Atrial Fibrillation: Doubts and Certainties From Basic and Clinical Studies | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 122 | issue = 2 | pages = 352–368 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29348255 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311402 | s2cid = 33841631 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simons SO, Elliott A, Sastry M, Hendriks JM, Arzt M, Rienstra M, Kalman JM, Heidbuchel H, Nattel S, Wesseling G, Schotten U, van Gelder IC, Franssen FM, Sanders P, Crijns HJ, Linz D | title = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atrial fibrillation: an interdisciplinary perspective | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 532–540 | date = February 2021 | pmid = 33206945 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa822 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 1942/35482 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Romiti GF, Corica B, Pipitone E, Vitolo M, Raparelli V, Basili S, Boriani G, Harari S, Lip GY, Proietti M | title = Prevalence, management and impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 4,200,000 patients | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 42 | issue = 35 | pages = 3541–3554 | date = September 2021 | pmid = 34333599 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehab453 | hdl-access = free | doi-access = free | hdl = 2434/887636 }}</ref> [[stimulant]] use (e.g., [[methamphetamine]] dependence), and [[alcohol use disorder|excessive alcohol consumption]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Voskoboinik A, Kalman JM, De Silva A, Nicholls T, Costello B, Nanayakkara S, Prabhu S, Stub D, Azzopardi S, Vizi D, Wong G, Nalliah C, Sugumar H, Wong M, Kotschet E, Kaye D, Taylor AJ, Kistler PM | title = Alcohol Abstinence in Drinkers with Atrial Fibrillation | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 382 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–28 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31893513 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1817591 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Rate versus rhythm control===
There are two ways to approach atrial fibrillation using medications: rate control and rhythm control. Both methods have similar outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Khatib SM, Allen LaPointe NM, Chatterjee R, Crowley MJ, Dupre ME, Kong DF, Lopes RD, Povsic TJ, Raju SS, Shah B, Kosinski AS, McBroom AJ, Sanders GD | title = Rate- and rhythm-control therapies in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = 11 | pages = 760–773 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24887617 | doi = 10.7326/M13-1467 | doi-access = free }}</ref> ''Rate control'' lowers the heart rate closer to normal, usually 60 to 100&nbsp;bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. ''Rhythm control'' tries to restore a normal heart rhythm in a process called cardioversion and maintains the normal rhythm with medications. Studies suggest that rhythm control is more important in the acute setting AF, whereas rate control is more important in the chronic phase.

The risk of stroke appears to be lower with rate control versus attempted rhythm control, at least in those with heart failure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frankel G, Kamrul R, Kosar L, Jensen B | title = Rate versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–168 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23418244 | pmc = 3576947 }}</ref> AF is associated with a reduced quality of life, and, while some studies indicate that rhythm control leads to a higher quality of life, some did not find a difference.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thrall G, Lane D, Carroll D, Lip GY | title = Quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 119 | issue = 5 | pages = 448.e1–448.19 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651058 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.10.057 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Neither rate nor rhythm control is superior in people with heart failure when they are compared in various clinical trials. However, rate control is recommended as the first-line treatment regimen for people with heart failure. On the other hand, rhythm control is only recommended when people experience persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trulock KM, Narayan SM, Piccini JP | title = Rhythm control in heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation: contemporary challenges including the role of ablation | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 64 | issue = 7 | pages = 710–721 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25125304 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.06.1169 | quote = Multiple studies have compared pharmacological rate and rhythm strategies but have failed to identify a superior therapy, a finding that extends to patients with HF. ...

===Rate control===
Rate control to a [[target heart rate]] of fewer than 110 beats per minute is recommended in most people.<ref name=AHA2013/> Lower heart rates may be recommended in those with left ventricular hypertrophy or reduced left ventricular function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Badheka AO, Shah N, Grover PM, Patel NJ, Chothani A, Mehta K, Singh V, Deshmukh A, Savani GT, Rathod A, Panaich SS, Patel N, Arora S, Bhalara V, Coffey JO, Mitrani RD, Halperin JL, Viles-Gonzalez JF | title = Outcomes in atrial fibrillation patients with and without left ventricular hypertrophy when treated with a lenient rate-control or rhythm-control strategy | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 113 | issue = 7 | pages = 1159–1165 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24507168 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.12.021 }}</ref> Rate control is achieved with medications that work by increasing the degree of the block at the level of the [[AV node]], decreasing the number of impulses that conduct into the ventricles.

In addition to these agents, amiodarone has some AV node blocking effects (in particular when administered intravenously) and can be used in individuals when other agents are contraindicated or ineffective (particularly due to hypotension).

===Surgery===
====Ablation====
[[Catheter ablation]] (CA) is a procedure performed by an [[Clinical cardiac electrophysiology|electrophysiologist]], a [[cardiologist]] who specializes in heart rhythm problems, to restore the heart's normal rhythm by destroying, or electrically isolating, specific parts of the atria. A group of cardiologists led by Dr [[Michel Haïssaguerre|Haïssaguerre]] from [[:fr:Centre hospitalier universitaire de Bordeaux|Bordeaux University Hospital]] noted in 1998 that the pulmonary veins are an important source of ectopic beats, initiating frequent paroxysms of atrial fibrillation, with these foci responding to treatment with radio-frequency ablation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haïssaguerre M, Jaïs P, Shah DC, Takahashi A, Hocini M, Quiniou G, Garrigue S, Le Mouroux A, Le Métayer P, Clémenty J | title = Spontaneous initiation of atrial fibrillation by ectopic beats originating in the pulmonary veins | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 339 | issue = 10 | pages = 659–666 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9725923 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199809033391003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Most commonly, CA electrically isolates the left atrium from the [[pulmonary vein]]s, where most of the abnormal electrical activity promoting atrial fibrillation originates.<ref name="Upadyhyay2019"/> CA is a form of rhythm control that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces AF-associated symptoms more reliably than antiarrhythmic medications.<ref name="Upadyhyay2019"/>

Electrophysiologists generally use two forms of catheter ablation—[[Ablation of atrial fibrillation|radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation]].

An alternative to catheter ablation is surgical ablation. The [[Cox maze procedure|maze procedure]], first performed in 1987, is an effective invasive surgical treatment that is designed to create electrical blocks or barriers in the atria of the heart.

AF often occurs after cardiac surgery and is usually self-limiting. It is strongly associated with age, preoperative hypertension, and the number of vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively to reduce the risk of AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with pre-operative hypertension, more than three vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. Postoperative pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic postoperative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.<ref name="pmid22235005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaleda VI, McCormack DJ, Shipolini AR | title = Does posterior pericardiotomy reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery? | journal = Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 384–389 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22235005 | pmc = 3309809 | doi = 10.1093/icvts/ivr099 }}</ref> When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be used if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or AF persists for six weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.

====After surgery====
After catheter ablation, people are moved to a cardiac recovery unit, [[intensive care unit]], or cardiovascular intensive care unit where they are not allowed to move for 4{{ndash}}6 hours. Minimizing movement helps prevent bleeding from the site of the catheter insertion. The length of time people stay in the hospital varies from hours to days. This depends on the problem, the length of the operation, and whether or not general anesthetic was used. Additionally, people should not engage in strenuous physical activity{{snd}}to maintain a low heart rate and low blood pressure{{snd}}for around six weeks.<ref name='AHA2014'>{{cite journal | vauthors = January CT, Wann LS, Alpert JS, Calkins H, Cigarroa JE, Cleveland JC, Conti JB, Ellinor PT, Ezekowitz MD, Field ME, Murray KT, Sacco RL, Stevenson WG, Tchou PJ, Tracy CM, Yancy CW | title = 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society | journal = Circulation | volume = 130 | issue = 23 | pages = e199–e267 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 24682347 | pmc = 4676081 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000041 }}

====Mechanism of thrombus formation====
In atrial fibrillation, the lack of an organized atrial contraction can result in some stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA) or [[left atrial appendage]] (LAA). This lack of movement of blood can lead to [[thrombus]] formation ([[coagulation|blood clotting]]). If the clot becomes mobile and is carried away by the blood circulation, it is called an [[embolus]]. An embolus proceeds through smaller and smaller [[artery|arteries]] until it plugs one of them and prevents blood from flowing through the artery. This process results in [[end organ damage]] due to the loss of nutrients, oxygen, and the removal of cellular waste products. Emboli in the brain may result in an [[ischemic stroke]] or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA).

More than 90% of cases of thrombi associated with non-valvular atrial fibrillation evolve in the left atrial appendage.<ref name="pmid8572814">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackshear JL, Odell JA | title = Appendage obliteration to reduce stroke in cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation | journal = The Annals of Thoracic Surgery | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 755–759 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8572814 | doi = 10.1016/0003-4975(95)00887-X | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, the LAA lies in close relation to the free wall of the left ventricle, and thus the LAA's emptying and filling, which determines its degree of blood stagnation, may be helped by the motion of the wall of the left ventricle if there is good ventricular function.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Saady NM, Obel OA, Camm AJ | title = Left atrial appendage: structure, function, and role in thromboembolism | journal = Heart | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 547–554 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10525506 | pmc = 1760793 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.82.5.547 }}</ref>

===Young people===
Atrial fibrillation is an uncommon condition in children but sometimes occurs in association with certain inherited and acquired conditions. [[Congenital heart disease]] and [[rheumatic fever]] are the most common causes of atrial fibrillation in children. Other inherited heart conditions associated with the development of atrial fibrillation in children include [[Brugada syndrome]], [[short QT syndrome]], [[Wolff Parkinson White syndrome]], and other forms of [[supraventricular tachycardia]] (e.g., [[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia]]).<ref name="Gourraud2018"/> Adults who survived congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing AF. In particular, people who had [[atrial septal defect]]s, [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], or [[Ebstein's anomaly]], and those who underwent the [[Fontan procedure]], are at higher risk with prevalence rates of up to 30% depending on the heart's anatomy and the person's age.<ref name="Ebrahim2018"/>

==History==
