'''Purkinje cells''' or '''Purkinje neurons''', named for Czech physiologist [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně]] who identified them in 1837,{{cn|date=January 2024}} are a unique type of prominent large [[Neuron|neurons]] located in the [[Cerebellum|cerebellar]] [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] of the [[brain]]. With their flask-shaped cell bodies, many branching [[Dendrite|dendrites]], and a single long [[axon]], these cells are essential for controlling motor activity. Purkinje cells mainly release GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitter, which inhibits some neurons to reduce nerve impulse transmission. Purkinje cells efficiently control and coordinate the body's motor motions through these inhibitory actions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-01-05 |title=Purkinje cell {{!}} Granule cells, Cerebellum & Neurons {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Purkinje-cell |access-date=2024-01-16 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Paul |first1=Manika S. |title=Histology, Purkinje Cells |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545154/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2024-01-16 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=31424738 |last2=Limaiem |first2=Faten}}</ref>

Purkinje cells send inhibitory projections to the deep cerebellar nuclei, and constitute the sole output of all [[motor coordination]] in the cerebellar cortex.

The Purkinje cells that develop later are those of the cerebellum's center-lying section called the vermis. They develop in the cerebellar primordium that covers the fourth ventricle and below a fissure-like region called the isthmus of the developing brain. Purkinje cells migrate toward the outer surface of the cerebellar cortex and form the Purkinje cell layer.

Purkinje cells are born during the earliest stages of cerebellar neurogenesis. Neurogenin2, together with neurogenin1, are transiently expressed in restricted domains of the ventricular neuroepithelium during the time-window of Purkinje cell genesis.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Zordan P, Croci L, Hawkes R, Consalez GG|title=Comparative analysis of proneural gene expression in the embryonic cerebellum|journal=Dev Dyn|volume=237|pages=726–735|year=2008|issue=6|doi=10.1002/dvdy.21571|pmid=18498101|doi-access=free}}</ref> This spatio-temporal distribution pattern suggests that neurogenins are involved in the specification of phenotypically heterogeneous Purkinje cell subsets, ultimately responsible for constructing the framework of the cerebellar topography.

Purkinje cells show two distinct forms of electrophysiological activity:

* '''Simple spikes''' occur at rates of 17 – 150&nbsp;Hz (Raman and Bean, 1999), either spontaneously or when Purkinje cells are activated synaptically by the parallel fibers, the axons of the granule cells.
* '''Complex spikes''' are slow, 1–3&nbsp;Hz spikes, characterized by an initial prolonged large-amplitude spike, followed by a high-frequency burst of smaller-amplitude action potentials. They are caused by climbing fiber activation and can involve the generation of calcium-mediated action potentials in the dendrites.  Following complex spike activity, simple spikes can be suppressed by the powerful complex spike input.<ref>Eric R. Kandel, James H. Schwartz, Thomas M. Jessell (2000). ''Principles of Neural Science. 4/e.'' McGraw-Hill. pp.837-40.</ref>

Purkinje cells show spontaneous electrophysiological activity in the form of trains of spikes both sodium-dependent and calcium-dependent. This was initially shown by [[Rodolfo Llinas]] (Llinas and Hess (1977) and Llinas and Sugimori (1980)). P-type calcium channels were named after Purkinje cells, where they were initially encountered (Llinas et al. 1989), which are crucial in cerebellar function. Activation of the Purkinje cell by climbing fibers can shift its activity from a quiet state to a spontaneously active state and vice versa, serving as a kind of toggle switch.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Loewenstein Y, Mahon S, Chadderton P, Kitamura K, Sompolinsky H, Yarom Y, etal |title=Bistability of cerebellar Purkinje cells modulated by sensory stimulation. |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=202–211 |year=2005 | doi=10.1038/nn1393|pmid=15665875 |s2cid=5543355 }}</ref> These findings have been challenged by a study suggesting that such toggling by climbing-fiber inputs occurs predominantly in anaesthetized animals and that Purkinje cells in awake behaving animals, in general, operate almost continuously in the upstate.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schonewille M, Khosrovani S, Winkelman BH, Hoebeek FE, DeJeu MT, Larsen IM, etal |title=Purkinje cells in awake behaving animals operate at the up state membrane potential. |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=459–461 |year=2006 | doi=10.1038/nn0406-459|pmid=16568098 |doi-access=free }}</ref> But this latter study has itself been challenged<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Loewenstein Y, Mahon S, Chadderton P, Kitamura K, Sompolinsky H, Yarom Y, etal |title=Purkinje cells in awake behaving animals operate at the up state membrane potential–Reply. |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=9 |pages=461 |year=2006 | doi=10.1038/nn0406-461|s2cid=28713325 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and Purkinje cell toggling has since been observed in awake cats.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yartsev MM, Givon-Mayo R, Maller M, Donchin O |title=Pausing Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of the awake cat. |journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience |volume=3 |pages=2 |year=2009 | doi=10.3389/neuro.06.002.2009|pmid=19390639 |pmc=2671936 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A computational model of the Purkinje cell has shown intracellular calcium computations to be responsible for toggling.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs.| journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=86 |year=2014 | doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086 | pmid=25191262 | pmc=4138505|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This defect in Ataxin 1 protein causes impairment of [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in Purkinje cells, leading to premature degeneration of the Purkinje cells.<ref name="pmid27394174">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stucki DM, Ruegsegger C, Steiner S, Radecke J, Murphy MP, Zuber B, Saxena S |title=Mitochondrial impairments contribute to Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 progression and can be ameliorated by the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ |journal=Free Radic.

Some domestic animals can develop a condition where the Purkinje cells begin to atrophy shortly after birth, called [[cerebellar abiotrophy]]. It can lead to symptoms such as [[ataxia]], intention tremors, hyperreactivity, lack of [[menace reflex]], stiff or high-stepping gait, apparent lack of awareness of foot position (sometimes standing or walking with a foot knuckled over), and a general inability to determine space and distance.<ref>For references, see the extensive references and bibliography at the article on [[Cerebellar abiotrophy]], linked at the beginning of this paragraph.</ref>  A similar condition known as [[cerebellar hypoplasia]] occurs when Purkinje cells fail to develop'' in utero'' or die off before birth.

The genetic conditions [[ataxia telangiectasia]] and [[Niemann Pick disease]] type C, as well as cerebellar [[essential tremor]], involve the progressive loss of Purkinje cells.
In Alzheimer's disease, spinal pathology is sometimes seen, as well as loss of dendritic branches of the Purkinje cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mavroudis |first=IA |author2=Fotiou, DF |author3=Adipepe, LF |author4=Manani, MG |author5=Njau, SD |author6=Psaroulis, D |author7=Costa, VG |author8=Baloyannis, SJ |title=Morphological changes of the human purkinje cells and deposition of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles on the cerebellar cortex of Alzheimer's disease |journal=American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Other Dementias |date=November 2010 |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=585–91 |pmid=20870670 |doi=10.1177/1533317510382892|s2cid=30688657 |pmc=10845446 }}</ref> Purkinje cells can also be damaged by the [[rabies]] virus as it migrates from the site of infection in the periphery to the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frontalcortex.com/?page=oll&topic=24&qid=1130 |title=Rabies encephalitis, Negri bodies within the cytoplasm of cerebellar Purkinje cell neurons |date=27 March 2009 |access-date=21 June 2013 |first=Makonnen |last=Fekadu |publisher=CDC/Frontal Cortex Inc. }} Note: not peer-reviewed.</ref>

==Etymology==

Purkinje cells are named after the Czech scientist Jan Evangelista Purkyně, who discovered them in 1839.{{cn|date=January 2024}}
