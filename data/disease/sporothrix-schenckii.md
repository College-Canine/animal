''Sporothrix schenckii'' can be found in one of two [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]], hyphal or yeast. The hyphal form is found in the environment on plants and decaying matter. When the fungus makes the transition into a host, the yeast morphology predominates.

===Hyphal===
When in the environment or grown in the laboratory at {{convert|25|C|F}} ''S. schenckii'' assumes its hyphal form.<ref name = Morris-Jones /> Macroscopically, filaments are apparent and colonies are moist, leathery to velvety, and have a finely wrinkled surface. The colour is white initially and may change color over time to become cream to dark brown ("dirty candle-wax" color).<ref name = Barros /> Microscopically, hyphae are [[hypha#Structure|septate]] approximately 1 to 2&nbsp;μm in diameter. [[Conidia]] are oval shaped and glass like ([[hyaline]]) in appearance. They may be colorless or darkly colored. Conidia are sometimes referred to as resembling a flower.<ref name = "MycologyOnline">[http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal_Descriptions/Hyphomycetes_%28dematiaceous%29/Sporothrix/] Mycology Online - University of Adelaide</ref>

===Yeast===
At {{convert|37|C|F}} either in the laboratory or in host tissue, ''S. schenckii'' assumes its yeast form. [[Macroscopic scale|Macroscopically]], the yeast form grows as smooth white or off-white colonies. Microscopically, yeast cells are 2 to 6&nbsp;μm long and show an elongated cigar-shaped morphology.<ref name = Barros />

==Epidemiology and risk factors==
''S. schenckii'' has a worldwide distribution<ref name = Barros /> but certain areas of the world including [[Peru]], have a higher incidence of disease.<ref name = "Pappas">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pappas PG, Tellez I, Deep AE, Nolasco D, Holgado W, Bustamante B |title=Sporotrichosis in Peru: description of an area of hyperendemicity |journal=Clin.

==Sporotrichosis==
[[File:Feline sporotrichosis 3.jpg|thumb|100px|Cutaneous sporotrichosis of a cat's paw showing ulcerations.]]
''S. schenckii'' most commonly enters the body through minor trauma that compromises the [[epidermis (skin)#Function|skin barrier]].<ref name = Kauffman /> It is this route of infection, coupled with its presence on [[rose]]s that give sporotrichosis its common name of "rose-handler's disease"<ref name = IowaState /> or "rose thorn disease".<ref name = "RoseSociety">{{cite web | title = Sporotrichosis: aka The Rose Thorn Disease | url = http://www.ars.org/pdfs/thorn_disease.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130626034401/http://www.ars.org/pdfs/thorn_disease.pdf | archive-date = 26 June 2013 | url-status = dead | publisher = American Rose Society }}</ref> Inhalation of spores is a rare route of infection largely associated with immunocompromised hosts.<ref name = Medscape />

===Cutaneous and lymphocutaneous===
The [[cutaneous condition|cutaneous]] form of disease is caused by introduction of ''S. schenckii'' into the body through disruption of the skin barrier.<ref name = Kauffman /> The first symptom of cutaneous sporotrichosis is a small skin [[lesion]]. These lesions may show [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]] and/or [[erythema]].<ref name = Barros /> Commonly, infection spreads through the [[lymph]] along [[lymphatic vessel]]s and causes lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. This form of disease is characterized by the appearance of lesions at sites distant to the initial infection.<ref name = Barros /> Infection can occur in nonhuman animals and may be transmitted to humans through contact. [[Veterinary physician|Veterinarians]] are at particularly high risk of contracting disease from animals ([[zoonosis|zoonotic infection]]).<ref name = "AVMA">{{cite journal | first = Ronald D. | last = Welsh | name-list-style = vanc | title = Sporotrichosis | journal = Vet Med Today: Zoonosis Update | volume = 223 | issue = 8 | pages = 1123–6 | date = October 2003 | url = https://www.avma.org/News/Journals/Collections/Documents/javma_223_8_1123.pdf | publisher = American Veterinary Medical Association | doi = 10.2460/javma.2003.223.1123 | pmid = 14584741 }}</ref>

===Disseminated===
[[Disseminated disease]] occurs when the fungus spreads throughout the body. Found only in immunocompromised patients,<ref name = Barros/><ref name = al-Tawfiq /><ref name = Medscape /> it is a very severe condition. When infection becomes disseminated, ''S. schencki'' can afflict joints, the brain, and the spine.<ref name = Barros /> Patients with this condition must be treated aggressively with [[antifungal medication|antifungals]] and may remain on [[antimicrobial prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antifungal drugs for life to prevent recurrence or reinfection.<ref name = Kauffman />

==Diagnostic tests==
''Sporothrix'' infection presents macroscopically with nonspecific [[#Sporotrichosis|symptoms]].<ref name = "DrFungus">[http://www.doctorfungus.org/Thefungi/sporothrix.php ''Sporothrix'' spp.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130414142324/http://www.doctorfungus.org/Thefungi/sporothrix.php |date=2013-04-14 }} Doctor Fungus</ref> In the clinical laboratory, many fungi isolated in culture are disregarded as [[contamination|contaminants]].<ref name = "Ban-Ami">{{cite journal|author-link4=Dimitrios Kontoyiannis |vauthors=Ben-Ami R, Lewis RE, Raad II, Kontoyiannis DP |title=Phaeohyphomycosis in a tertiary care cancer center |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=1033–41 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19267655 |doi=10.1086/597400|doi-access=free }}</ref> Therefore, accurate patient histories are important<ref name = Vasquez /> to establish suspicion of sporotrichosis and to inform which diagnostic tests are required.<ref name = Barros /> ''S. schenckii'' infection may also be confused with other diseases such as [[pyoderma gangrenosum]]<ref name = DrFungus /> or [[sarcoidosis]]<ref name = "Singh">{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh MF, Fernandes SR, Samara AM |title=''Sporothrix schenckii'' infection mimicking sarcoidosis |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=248–9 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14739470 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keh010|doi-access=free }}</ref> further underscoring the need for accurate diagnoses.

===Primary cultures===
Growing the fungus in pure culture is the most reliable way to identify ''Sporothrix'' infection.<ref name = Vasquez /> A patient swab or [[biopsy]] is used to inoculate [[Sabouraud agar]]<ref name = "Medscape">{{cite web | vauthors = Miller SD | veditors = Vinson RP, Libow LF | title = Dermatologic Manifestations of Sporotrichosis Workup | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1091159-workup | date = May 2016 | work = Medscape }}</ref> or [[brain heart infusion broth|brain heart infusion agar]].<ref name = "IowaState">{{cite web | title = Sporotrichosis: Rose Handler's Disease | date = February 2017 | url = http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/sporotrichosis.pdf | publisher = Iowa State University }}</ref> Sabouraud agar is incubated at room temperature for macroscopic observation of the off-white or dark brown/black [[hypha]]l form of the fungus and microscopic examination of hyphae and conidia.<ref name = Vasquez /><ref name = Medscape /> The yeast form is grown on brain heart infusion agar at {{convert|37|°C|°F}}.<ref name = IowaState /> Observation of yeast colonies in addition to the hyphal form is required to confirm diagnosis of ''S. schenckii''.<ref name = DrFungus /> Growth on media occurs in approximately one to three weeks<ref name = IowaState /> meaning that results from patient cultures will not be immediately available to make treatment decisions.

===Sporotrichin skin test===
A skin test uses an [[antigen]] generated from laboratory grown ''S. schenckii'' to challenge the patient's immune system. The antigen is [[dermis|intradermally injected]] and the test is interpreted 48 hours later. Erythema at the site of injection indicates a positive response.<ref name = "Barros" /><ref name = IowaState /> The major advantage of this test is its rapidity and ease of use. Although it provides results more quickly than a fungal culture, the sporotrichin skin test has some important limitations. [[Cross-reactivity|Cross reactions]] with other fungal species<ref name = "Ishizaki">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishizaki H, Nakamura Y, Kariya H, Iwatsu T, Wheat R |title=Delayed hypersensitivity cross-reactions between ''Sporothrix schenckii'' and ''Ceratocystis'' species in sporotrichotic patients |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=545–7 |year=1976 |doi=10.1128/jcm.3.6.545-547.1976 |pmc=274353 |pmid=59734}}</ref> as well as positive reactions in healthy individuals<ref name = Barros /> have been observed. In addition, the term "sporotrichin" does not indicate a specific molecule but only any antigen derived from ''S. schenckii''. The specific antigen used in skin testing is not standardized with multiple studies being conducted with widely varying preparations. However, owing to its simplicity, skin testing remains the method of choice for large-scale epidemiological investigations.<ref name = Barros />

===Molecular methods===
[[Molecular pathology|Molecular diagnostic]] techniques have been used as rapid, [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive, and specific]] tests for the presence of ''S. schenckii''.<ref name="pmid14960763">{{cite journal | vauthors = Atkins SD, Clark IM | title = Fungal molecular diagnostics: a mini review | journal = Journal of Applied Genetics | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | date = 2004 | pmid = 14960763 | s2cid = 5658182 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd61/8f214d5d8f45e31a969d46cbff30452c7b0d.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190505154437/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd61/8f214d5d8f45e31a969d46cbff30452c7b0d.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2019-05-05 }}</ref> [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] methods that specifically amplify the [[18S ribosomal RNA|ribosomal RNA]] gene have been shown to detect ''S. schenckii'' in clinical samples with minimal interference from host or bacterial sequences.<ref name = "Hu">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hu S, Chung WH, Hung SI, etal |title=Detection of ''Sporothrix schenckii'' in clinical samples by a nested PCR assay |journal=J.

==Treatment==

===Antifungal drugs===
Where available and tolerated by the patient, antifungal drugs are indicated as the primary treatment of sporotrichosis. For cutaneous infection [[itraconazole]] or [[terbinafine]] are the primary treatment with [[fluconazole]] being recommended if primary antifungals are not well tolerated. When infection is [[#Disseminated|disseminated]] throughout the body, [[Amphotericin B]] is the drug of choice. To completely clear the fungus, the course of treatment generally lasts from 3 to 6 months.<ref name = "Kauffman">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kauffman CA, Bustamante B, Chapman SW, Pappas PG |title=Clinical practice guidelines for the management of sporotrichosis: 2007 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clin.

===Potassium iodide===
Oral administration of a saturated [[potassium iodide]] solution was the first effective treatment for sporotrichosis and remains the drug of choice in many parts of the world owing to its low cost and availability.<ref name = "Sterling">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sterling JB, Heymann WR |title=Potassium iodide in dermatology: a 19th century drug for the 21st century-uses, pharmacology, adverse effects, and contraindications |journal=J.

==Virulence factors==

===Melanin production===
{{see also|Tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase|Scytalone dehydratase}}
''S. schenckii'' synthesizes [[melanin]] both ''in vitro'' and ''[[in vivo]]''<ref name = "Morris-Jones">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morris-Jones R, Youngchim S, Gomez BL, etal |title=Synthesis of melanin-like pigments by ''Sporothrix schenckii'' in vitro and during mammalian infection |journal=Infect.

Melanin production is a virulence factor found in many fungi that cause disease<ref name = "Revankar">{{cite journal |vauthors=Revankar SG, Sutton DA |title=Melanized fungi in human disease |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=884–928 |date=October 2010 |pmc=2952981 |doi=10.1128/cmr.00019-10 |pmid=20930077}}</ref> and its production in ''S. schenckii'' protects the fungus from oxidative stress as well as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[macrophage]] killing. Melanin has been shown to be synthesized using the 1,8-DHN [[pentaketide]] pathway (below).<ref name = Morris-Jones />

[[File:Polyketide Pathway Melanin Biosynthesis in Sporothrix schenckii.png|center|800px|thumb|Structures of some intermediates in the pentaketide pathway of melanin biosynthesis in ''S. schenckii''.

===Adhesins===
Adhesion is an important component of pathogenesis. The yeast form of ''S. schenckii'' shows an increased ability to bind<ref name = "Barros" /> to the host extracellular matrix proteins [[fibronectin]] and [[laminin]] using two separate receptors specific for these proteins.<ref name = "Lima">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lima OC, Bouchara JP, Renier G, Marot-Leblond A, Chabasse D, Lopes-Bezerra LM |title=Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis of fibronectin and laminin binding to ''Sporothrix schenckii'' yeast cells and conidia |journal=Microb.

===Proteases===
''S. schenckii'' breaks down proteins by producing two separate [[protease]]s, a [[serine protease]] and an [[aspartate protease|aspartic protease]].<ref name = "Hogan">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hogan LH, Klein BS, Levitz SM |title=Virulence factors of medically important fungi |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=469–88 |date=October 1996 |pmc=172905 |pmid=8894347|doi=10.1128/CMR.9.4.469 }}</ref> These proteases appear to be essential for fungal growth. However, they have some functional overlap as the inactivation of either protein does not affect growth but inactivation of both inhibits the fungus.<ref name = "Tsuboi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsuboi R, Sanada T, Ogawa H |title=Influence of culture medium pH and proteinase inhibitors on extracellular proteinase activity and cell growth of ''Sporothrix schenckii'' |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=1431–3 |date=July 1988 |doi=10.1128/jcm.26.7.1431-1433.1988 |pmc=266631 |pmid=3045155}}</ref> Protease activity has been shown to be important in ''in vivo'' infection of mice.<ref name = "Hogan" /> Substrates for these proteases include the skin proteins [[type-I collagen]], [[stratum corneum]], and [[elastin]].<ref name = "Hogan" />

===Heat tolerance===
Growing at host body temperature ({{convert|37|C|F}}) is an important requirement for pathogenesis. Some strains of ''S. schenckii'' are restricted to growing at {{convert|35|C|F}} and consequently usually cause disease only on the skin as it is cooler than the body's interior. Those that are capable of growth at body temperature are more often associated with disseminated disease.<ref name = "Hogan" />

==Immune response==
Infection by ''S. schenckii'' is generally [[self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]] in immunocompetent hosts. The immune response prevents fungal dissemination and is the reason that most ''Sporothrix'' infections are [[#Cutaneous and Lymphocutaneous|cutaneous]].<ref name = "Carlos">{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlos IZ, Sassá MF, da Graça Sgarbi DB, Placeres MC, Maia DC |title=Current research on the immune response to experimental sporotrichosis |journal=Mycopathologia |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19241140 |doi=10.1007/s11046-009-9190-z|s2cid=39610 }}</ref>

===Innate===
The yeast form of ''S. schenckii'' is effectively [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] by [[innate immune system#White blood cells|cells of the innate immune system]]<ref name = "Carlos" /> and are recognized based on the sugars displayed on their surface<ref name = "Oda">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oda LM, Kubelka CF, Alviano CS, Travassos LR |title=Ingestion of yeast forms of ''Sporothrix schenckii'' by mouse peritoneal macrophages |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=497–504 |date=February 1983 |doi=10.1128/iai.39.2.497-504.1983 |pmc=347978 |pmid=6832808}}</ref> or lipids in the yeast cell membrane.<ref name = "Carlos" /> Although they are taken up, they are not efficiently killed. It is hypothesized that [[ergosterol peroxide]] reacts with and detoxifies [[reactive oxygen species]] generated by the [[respiratory burst]] used by phagocytes to kill cells they have ingested.<ref name = "Carlos" /> ''S. schenckii'' is also capable of modulating the immune response to promote its own survival by blocking [[cytokine]] production by macrophages.<ref name = "Carlos" />

===Specific===
The specific immune response is active later in infection and involves both [[B cell]]s and [[T cell]]s. Severe sporotrichosis is rare in endemic areas where humans are in near constant contact with ''S. schenckii'' spores. This fact, combined with the increased severity of disease in immunocompromised patients points to an important role for [[adaptive immune system|specific immunity]] in ''S. schenckii'' infection.<ref name = "Carlos" /> Patients with sporotrichosis have been shown to produce antibodies specific to ''S. schenckii''<ref name = "Scott">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott EN, Muchmore HG |title=Immunoblot analysis of antibody responses to ''Sporothrix schenckii'' |journal=J.
