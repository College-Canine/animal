The '''Bullmastiff''' is an English [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] of [[mastiff]] type and large size, with a solid build and a short muzzle. It was developed as a [[guard dog]] in the nineteenth century by [[cross-breeding]] the [[English Mastiff]] with the now-extinct [[Old English Bulldog]]. It was recognised as a breed by [[The Kennel Club]] in 1924.

== History ==

The origins of the Bullmastiff are unclear. In the 18th century, in some regions of England, the [[English Mastiff]] and [[Old English Bulldog]] were commonly [[cross-breed|inter-bred]] to produce dogs suitable for guarding people and their property. By the beginning of the 20th century, this cross-breed was in widespread use as an aid to [[gamekeeper]]s in the control of [[poaching]].{{r|makins}} They were bred for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive 19th century [[Bulldog]] with the large, strong, less aggressive [[Mastiff]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Walkey B. The Bullmastiff Fancier's Manual. Sechelt B.C., Canada: Coast Arts Publishing; 1992</ref> As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog.

The Bullmastiff was recognised as a breed by [[The Kennel Club]] in 1924. Dogs had to have a minimum of four generations of descent from Bullmastiff stock without input from either Bulldog or Mastiff; cross-bred animals could not be registered.{{r|makins}} The [[American Kennel Club]] recognised it in 1934.{{r|akc}}<br />It was definitively accepted by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] in 1955.{{r|fci}}

In 1928, the [[De Beers]] diamond mining company imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines.<ref name="sabt.co.za">{{cite web|url=http://sabt.co.za/constitution/AppendixA.pdf|title=Breed standard (Appendix A)|publisher=Sabt.co.za|access-date=18 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816173036/http://sabt.co.za/constitution/AppendixA.pdf|archive-date=16 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Bullmastiff is a large dog. Bitches stand some {{nobreak|61–66 cm}} at the [[withers]], and usually weigh {{nobreak|41–50 kg}}; on average, dogs stand about {{nobreak|3 cm}} taller and weigh {{nobreak|9 kg}} more.{{r|fci2}}

The coat may be fawn, red or brindle, in any shade; some limited white marking on the chest is allowed. The muzzle is black, becoming paler towards the eyes.{{r|fci2}}

The Bullmastiff is [[brachycephalic]], flat-faced and short-muzzled, but this does not affect its breathing.<ref name=kc>[https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/health/for-owners/brachycephalic-health/ Brachycephalic dogs]. The Kennel Club.</ref>{{failed verification|date=February 2022}}

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for [[Mongrel|crossbreeds]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=McMillan | first=Kirsten M. | last2=Bielby | first2=Jon | last3=Williams | first3=Carys L. | last4=Upjohn | first4=Melissa M. | last5=Casey | first5=Rachel A. | last6=Christley | first6=Robert M. | title=Longevity of companion dog breeds: those at risk from early death | journal=Scientific Reports | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=14 | issue=1 | date=2024-02-01 | issn=2045-2322 | doi=10.1038/s41598-023-50458-w | page=| pmc=10834484 }}</ref>

* [[Lymphoma in animals|Lymphoma]]
* [[Progressive retinal atrophy]] is a particular problem, since the trait is an [[Autosomal dominant#Autosomal dominant gene|autosomal dominant]] one. (This has recently been called into question by another medical team and has been proven that some Bullmastiffs have autosomal recessive PRA genes. In America, this is being investigated by the American Bullmastiff Health and Research Committee, and the DNA Optigen test only works for dominant genes, so it is considered inadequate at this time.)<ref>{{cite web|title=PRA| date=6 April 2023 |url=http://www.bullmastiffklubben.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58:viktigt-om-pra&catid=43:pra&Itemid=66|publisher=Swedish Bullmastiff Club}}</ref>
