The '''pituitary gland''' (or '''hypophysis cerebri''') is an [[endocrine gland]] in [[vertebrate|vertebrates]]. In [[Human|humans]], the pituitary gland is located at the base of the [[Human brain|brain]], protruding off the bottom of the [[hypothalamus]]. The human pituitary gland is oval shaped, about the size of a [[chickpea]],<ref>{{cite book |first=Gareth |last=Leng |title=The Heart of the Brain: The Hypothalamus and its Hormones |date=2018 |quote=The gland in humans is described in Wikipedia as being the size of a pea. So common is this description that it seemed likely to be wrong, as I confirmed by examining a selection of peas. Wikipedia also gives the weight of the human pituitary as about half a gram, and in this it is more correct. The pituitary in a human is at least five times the average size of my peas; it is more like the size of a chickpea.}}</ref> and weighs {{convert|0.5|g|oz}} on average. 

[[Hormone]]s secreted from the pituitary gland help to control [[human development (biology)|growth]], [[blood pressure]], energy management, all functions of the [[sex organ]]s, [[thyroid gland]]s, [[metabolism]], as well as some aspects of [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], [[breastfeeding]], [[Osmoregulation|water/salt concentration]] at the [[kidneys]], temperature regulation, and pain relief.

==Structure==
In humans, the pituitary gland rests upon the [[hypophyseal fossa]] of the [[sphenoid bone]], in the center of the [[middle cranial fossa]]. It sits in a protective bony enclosure called the [[sella turcica]], covered by the [[Dura mater|dural]] fold [[diaphragma sellae]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Gray's Clinical Anatomy |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4377-3580-2 |editor-last=Mancall |editor-first=Elliott L. |page=154 |chapter=Cranial Fossae |editor-last2=Brock |editor-first2=David G. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6ARC5tdhtYC&pg=PA154}}</ref> 

The pituitary gland is composed of the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior pituitary lobe]], the [[Posterior pituitary|posterior pituitary lobe]], and an [[Pars intermedia|intermediate lobe]] that joins them.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganapathy MK, Tadi P | title = Anatomy, Head and Neck, Pituitary Gland |journal=StatPearls [Internet] | publisher = StatPearls Publishing | date = Jan 2020 | pmid = 31855373 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551529/ | access-date = 24 Sep 2020}}</ref> The intermediate lobe is [[avascular]] and almost absent in humans.

===Anterior===
{{main|Anterior pituitary}}
The anterior pituitary lobe (or adenohypophysis) arises from an [[invagination]] of the oral [[ectoderm]] ([[Rathke's pouch]]). This contrasts with the [[posterior pituitary]], which originates from [[neuroectoderm]].

[[Endocrine system|Endocrine cells]] of the anterior pituitary are controlled by regulatory hormones released by [[parvocellular neurosecretory cell]]s in the hypothalamic capillaries leading to infundibular blood vessels, which in turn lead to a second capillary bed in the anterior pituitary. This vascular relationship constitutes the [[hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system]]. Diffusing out of the second capillary bed, the hypothalamic [[releasing hormone]]s then bind to anterior pituitary endocrine cells, upregulating or downregulating their release of hormones.<ref name="Boron2009">{{cite book | last1=Boron | first1=Walter F. | last2=Boulpaep | first2=Emile L. | title=Medical Physiology | edition=2nd | publisher=Saunders Elsevier | location=Philadelphia | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-4160-3115-4 | pages=1016–1017}}</ref>

The anterior lobe of the pituitary can be divided into the [[pars tuberalis]] (pars infundibularis) and [[pars distalis]] (pars glandularis) that constitutes ~80% of the gland. The [[pars intermedia]] (the intermediate lobe) lies between the pars distalis and the pars tuberalis, and is rudimentary in the human, although in other species it is more developed.<ref name=":0" /> It develops from a depression in the dorsal wall of the [[pharynx]] (stomal part) known as [[Rathke's pouch]].

The [[anterior pituitary]] contains several different types of cells<ref>{{Cite book|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology|publisher=Elsevier Saunders}}</ref> that synthesize and secrete hormones. Usually there is one type of cell for each major hormone formed in [[anterior pituitary]]. With special stains attached to high-affinity antibodies that bind with distinctive hormone, at least 5 types of cells can be differentiated.

===Posterior===
{{main|Posterior pituitary}}
The posterior lobe develops as an extension of the hypothalamus, from the floor of the [[third ventricle]]. The posterior pituitary hormones are synthesized by cell bodies in the [[hypothalamus]]. The [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s, of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei located in the hypothalamus, project axons down the infundibulum to terminals in the posterior pituitary. This simple arrangement differs sharply from that of the adjacent anterior pituitary, which does not develop from the hypothalamus.

The release of pituitary hormones by both the anterior and posterior lobes is under the control of the [[hypothalamus]], albeit in different ways.<ref name="Boron2009" />

==Functions==
[[File:Pituiary gland - regulatory hormones.png|thumb|280px|]]The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes by secreting hormones. This includes stress (by secreting [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]]), growth (by secreting [[Growth hormone|GH]]), reproduction (by secreting [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]), metabolism rate (by secreting [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]]) and [[lactation]] (by secreting [[prolactin]]). The [[intermediate lobe]] synthesizes and secretes [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]]. The [[posterior pituitary]] (or neurohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the [[hypothalamus]] by the [[median eminence]] via a small tube called the [[pituitary stalk]] (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum). It regulates hydroelectrolytic stability (by secreting [[Vasopressin|ADH]]), uterine contraction during labor and human attachment (by secreting [[oxytocin]]).

===Anterior===
The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes hormones. All '''releasing hormones''' (-RH) referred to can also be referred to as '''releasing factors''' (-RF).

[[Somatotropic cell|Somatotropes]]:
* [[Human growth hormone]] (HGH), also referred to as 'growth hormone' (GH) or somatotropin, is released under the influence of hypothalamic [[growth hormone-releasing hormone]] (GHRH), and is [[Releasing and inhibiting hormones|inhibited]] by hypothalamic [[somatostatin]].

[[Corticotropic cell|Corticotropes]]:
* Cleaved from the precursor [[proopiomelanocortin]] protein, and include [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), and [[beta-endorphin]], and [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] are released under the influence of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Knepel | first1 = W | last2 = Homolka | first2 = L | last3 = Vlaskovska | first3 = M | last4 = Nutto | first4 = D | date = 1984 | title = Stimulation of adrenocorticotropin/beta-endorphin release by synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing factor in vitro: Enhancement by various vasopressin analogs | journal = Neuroendocrinology | volume = 38 | number = 5 | pages = 344–50 | doi = 10.1159/000123915 | pmid = 6328345}}</ref><ref name=Goodman12th>{{cite book|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Björn C.|title=Goodman & Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics.|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8|edition=12th}}</ref>{{rp|1210}}

[[Thyrotropic cell|Thyrotropes]]:
* [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) is released under the influence of [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH) and is inhibited by somatostatin.

[[Gonadotropic cell|Gonadotropes]]:
* [[Luteinizing hormone]] (LH).
* [[Follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), both released under influence of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH)

[[Lactotropic cell|Lactotropes]]:
* [[Prolactin]] (PRL), whose release is inconsistently stimulated by hypothalamic TRH, oxytocin, vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, angiotensin II, neuropeptide Y, galanin, substance P, bombesin-like peptides (gastrin-releasing peptide, neuromedin B and C), and neurotensin, and inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine.<ref name="Melmed2010">{{cite book|author=Shlomo Melmed|title=The pituitary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFFW68kMpFIC&pg=PA40|date=3 December 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-380926-1|page=40}}</ref>

These hormones are released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of the [[hypothalamus]]. Hypothalamic hormones are secreted to the anterior lobe by way of a special [[capillary]] system, called the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system]].

There is also a non-endocrine cell population called [[folliculostellate cell]]s.

===Intermediate===
The intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes the following important endocrine hormone:
* [[Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|Melanocyte–stimulating hormone]] (MSH). This is also produced in the anterior lobe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pocock|first1=Gillian|title=Human Physiology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856878-0|page=193|edition=Third}}</ref> When produced in the intermediate lobe, MSHs are sometimes called "intermedins".

===Posterior===
The posterior pituitary stores and secretes (but does not synthesize) the following important endocrine hormones:

[[Magnocellular neurosecretory cell|Magnocellular neurons]]:
* [[Antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH, also known as [[vasopressin]] and arginine vasopressin AVP), the majority of which is released from the [[supraoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]].
* [[Oxytocin]], most of which is released from the [[paraventricular nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. Oxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a [[positive feedback]] loop. For example, uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, which, in turn, increases uterine contractions. This positive feedback loop continues throughout labour.

===Hormones===
Hormones secreted from the pituitary gland help control the following body processes:
* [[Human development (biology)|Growth]] (GH)
* [[Blood pressure]]
* Some aspects of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] including stimulation of [[Uterine contraction#Childbirth|uterine contractions]]
* [[Lactation#Hormonal influences|Breast milk production]]
* [[Sex organ]] functions in both [[sex]]es
* [[Thyroid gland]] function
* [[Metabolism|Metabolic]] conversion of food into [[energy]]
* [[Water]] and [[osmolarity]] regulation in the body
* Water balance via the control of reabsorption of [[water]] by the [[kidneys]]
* Temperature regulation
* [[Pain]] relief

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Acromegaly hands.JPEG|thumb|A normal-sized hand (left) and the enlarged hand of someone with acromegaly (right)]]
{{main|Pituitary disease}}

Some of the diseases involving the pituitary gland are:
* [[Central diabetes insipidus]] caused by a deficiency of [[vasopressin]]
* [[Gigantism]] and [[acromegaly]] caused by an excess of growth hormone in childhood and adult, respectively
* [[Hypothyroidism]] caused by a deficiency of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]]
* [[Hyperpituitarism]], the increased (hyper) secretion of one or more of the hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland
* [[Hypopituitarism]], the decreased (hypo) secretion of one or more of the hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland
* [[Panhypopituitarism]] a decreased secretion of most of the pituitary hormones
* [[Pituitary tumour]]s
* [[Pituitary adenoma]]s, noncancerous [[tumor]]s that occur in the pituitary gland

All of the functions of the pituitary gland can be adversely affected by an over- or under-production of associated hormones.

The pituitary gland is important for mediating the stress response, via the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] (HPA axis). Critically, pituitary gland growth during adolescence can be altered by early life stress such as childhood maltreatment or maternal dysphoric behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Early life stress alters pituitary growth during adolescence—A longitudinal study|url = http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530%252815%252900019-0/abstract|journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology|pages = 185–194|volume = 53|doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.01.005|first1 = Despina E.|last1 = Ganella|first2 = Nicholas B.|last2 = Allen|first3 = Julian G.|last3 = Simmons|first4 = Orli|last4 = Schwartz|first5 = Jee Hyun|last5 = Kim|first6 = Lisa|last6 = Sheeber|first7 = Sarah|last7 = Whittle|pmid=25622011|year = 2015|hdl = 10536/DRO/DU:30144589|s2cid = 5247274}}</ref>

It has been demonstrated that, after controlling for age, sex, and BMI, larger quantities of [[DHEA]] and [[DHEA-S]] tended to be linked to larger pituitary volume.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CR|last2=Simmons|first2=JG|last3=Allen|first3=NB|last4=Byrne|first4=ML|last5=Mundy|first5=LK|last6=Seal|first6=ML|last7=Patton|first7=GC|last8=Olsson|first8=CA|last9=Whittle|first9=S|title=Associations between dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, pituitary volume, and social anxiety in children.|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=February 2016|volume=64|pages=31–9|pmid=26600008|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.004|s2cid=22520320}}</ref> Additionally, a correlation between pituitary gland volume and Social Anxiety subscale scores was identified which provided a basis for exploring mediation.

==History==

===Etymology===
{{Wiktionary|pituitary gland|hypophysis}}

====Pituitary gland====
The Greek [[physician]] [[Galen]] referred to the pituitary gland by only using the ([[Ancient Greek]]) name {{Lang|grc|ἀδήν}},<ref name="Hyrtl1880">Hyrtl, J. (1880). ''Onomatologia Anatomica. Geschichte und Kritik der anatomischen Sprache der Gegenwart.'' Wien: Wilhelm Braumüller. K.K. Hof- und Universitätsbuchhändler.</ref> ''gland''.<ref name="Liddell & Scott">Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). ''A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> He described the pituitary gland as part of a series of secretory organs for the excretion of [[nasal mucus]].<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/> Anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] translated {{Lang|grc|ἀδήν}} with ''glans, in quam pituita destillat'', "gland in which slime (''pituita''<ref name="Lewis & Short">Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). ''A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref>) drips".<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/><ref name="Schreger">Schreger, C.H.Th.(1805). ''Synonymia anatomica. Synonymik der anatomischen Nomenclatur.'' Fürth: im Bureau für Literatur.</ref> Besides this 'descriptive' name, Vesalius used ''glandula pituitaria'', from which the English name ''pituitary gland''<ref name="Dorland">Anderson, D.M. (2000). ''Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary'' (29th edition). Philadelphia/London/Toronto/Montreal/Sydney/Tokyo: W.B. Saunders Company.</ref> is ultimately derived.

The expression ''glandula pituitaria'' is still used as official synonym beside ''hypophysis'' in the official Latin nomenclature ''[[Terminologia Anatomica]]''.<ref name="FCAT">Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) (1998). ''Terminologia Anatomica''. Stuttgart: Thieme</ref> In the seventeenth century the supposed function of the pituitary gland to produce nasal mucus was debunked.<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/> The expression ''glandula pituitaria'' and its English equivalent ''pituitary gland'' can only be justified from a historical point of view.<ref name="Triepel1927">Triepel, H. (1927). ''Die anatomischen Namen. Ihre Ableitung und Aussprache. Anhang: Biographische Notizen.''(Elfte Auflage). München: Verlag J.F. Bergmann.</ref> The inclusion of this synonym is merely justified by noting that the main term ''hypophysis'' is a much less popular term.<ref name="NA3-62">International Anatomical Nomenclature Committee (1966). ''Nomina Anatomica''. Amsterdam: Excerpta Medica Foundation, p. 62</ref>

====Hypophysis====
{{Anchor|Hypophysial|Hypophyseal}}
Note: ''hypophysial'' (or ''hypophyseal'') means "related to the hypophysis (pituitary gland)".

The anatomist [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring]] coined the name ''hypophysis''.<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/> This name consists<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/><ref name="Triepel1927"/> of ὑπό ('under')<ref name="Liddell & Scott"/> and φύειν ('to grow').<ref name="Liddell & Scott"/> In later Greek ὑπόφυσις is used differently by Greek physicians as ''outgrowth''.<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/> Sömmering also used the equivalent expression ''appendix cerebri'',<ref name="Hyrtl1880"/><ref name="Schreger"/> with ''appendix'' as ''appendage''.<ref name="Lewis & Short"/> In various languages, {{Lang|de|Hirnanhang}}<ref name="Schreger"/> in [[German language|German]] and {{Lang|nl|hersenaanhangsel}}<ref name="Pinkhof1923">Pinkhof, H. (1923). ''Vertalend en verklarend woordenboek van uitheemsche geneeskundige termen.'' Haarlem: De Erven F. Bohn.</ref> in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the terms are derived from ''appendix cerebri''.

==Other animals==
The pituitary gland is found in all vertebrates, but its structure varies among different groups.

The division of the pituitary described above is typical of [[mammal]]s, and is also true, to varying degrees, of all [[tetrapod]]s. However, only in mammals does the posterior pituitary have a compact shape. In [[lungfish]], it is a relatively flat sheet of tissue lying above the anterior pituitary, but in [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[bird]]s, it becomes increasingly well developed. The intermediate lobe is, in general, not well developed in any species and is entirely absent in birds.<ref name="VB" />

The structure of the pituitary in fish, apart from the lungfish, is generally different from that in other animals. In general, the intermediate lobe tends to be well developed, and may equal the remainder of the anterior pituitary in size. The posterior lobe typically forms a sheet of tissue at the base of the pituitary stalk, and in most cases sends irregular finger-like projection into the tissue of the anterior pituitary, which lies directly beneath it. The anterior pituitary is typically divided into two regions, a more anterior ''rostral'' portion and a posterior ''proximal'' portion, but the boundary between the two is often not clearly marked. In [[elasmobranch]]s there is an additional, ''ventral lobe'' beneath the anterior pituitary proper.<ref name="VB"/>

The arrangement in [[lamprey]]s, which are among the most primitive of all fish, may indicate how the pituitary originally evolved in ancestral vertebrates. Here, the posterior pituitary is a simple flat sheet of tissue at the base of the brain, and there is no pituitary stalk. Rathke's pouch remains open to the outside, close to the nasal openings. Closely associated with the pouch are three distinct clusters of glandular tissue, corresponding to the intermediate lobe, and the rostral and proximal portions of the anterior pituitary. These various parts are separated by [[meninges|meningial]] membranes, suggesting that the pituitary of other vertebrates may have formed from the fusion of a pair of separate, but associated, glands.<ref name="VB"/>

Most [[armadillos]] also possess a neural secretory gland very similar in form to the posterior pituitary, but located in the tail and associated with the [[spinal cord]]. This may have a function in [[osmoregulation]].<ref name="VB"/>

There is a structure [[Homology (biology)|analogous]] to the pituitary in the [[octopus]] brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wells |first1=M. J. |last2=Wells |first2=J. |year=1969 |title=Pituitary Analogue in the Octopus |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=222 |issue=5190 |pages=293–294 |doi=10.1038/222293a0 |pmid=5778406 |bibcode=1969Natur.222..293W |s2cid=4159935 }}</ref>

===Intermediate lobe===
Although rudimentary in humans (and often considered part of the [[anterior pituitary]]), the [[Pars intermedia|intermediate lobe]] located between the anterior and posterior pituitary is important to many animals. For instance, in fish, it is believed to control physiological color change. In adult humans, it is just a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary. The intermediate lobe produces [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (MSH), although this function is often (imprecisely) attributed to the anterior pituitary.

The intermediate lobe is, in general, not well developed in tetrapods, and is entirely absent in birds.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 549–550|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
