'''Castration''' is any action, [[surgery|surgical]], [[chemical substance|chemical]], or otherwise, by which a [[male]] loses use of the [[testicles]]: the male [[gonad]]. Surgical castration is bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (excision of both testicles), while [[chemical castration]] uses [[pharmaceutical drug]]s to deactivate the testes. Castration causes [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] (preventing the castrated person or animal from [[reproduction|reproducing]]); it also greatly reduces the production of [[hormone]]s, such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Surgical castration in animals is often called [[neutering]].

[[#Animals|Castration of animals]] is intended to favor a desired development of the animal or of its habits, as an [[anaphrodisiac]] or to prevent [[overpopulation]]. The parallel of castration for female animals is [[spaying]]. Castration may also refer medically to [[oophorectomy]] in female humans and animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simmer |first1=H. H. |title=[Bilateral oophorectomy in the woman in late 19th century.

The term ''castration'' may also be sometimes used to refer to [[emasculation]] where both the testicles ''and'' the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two.

===Europe===
==== Slavery ====
The employment or enslavement of eunuchs (castrated men) was practiced in classical and Roman antiquity and continued into the Middle Ages. In the 10th century, slave traders in Verdun in France and in Becâne ([[Pechina]]), Spain, castrated captives who were then enslaved as harem attendants in [[Al-Andalus]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gök |first1=H.

[[Wim Deetman]] was criticized by the Dutch parliament for excluding evidence of castration<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands|title=Time for the truth about Catholic sex abuse in the Netherlands|work=RNW|access-date=21 March 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120321230333/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/time-truth-about-catholic-sex-abuse-netherlands|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, where ten children were allegedly "punished" by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests. The Deetman Commission had rejected it as the person who reported the incident admitted it was speculative.

===China===
According to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BC, castration was passed into law as a punishment, remaining so until the reign of [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu of Tang]] (618–626 AD).

During the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)]], Chinese commanders castrated thousands of [[Miao people|Miao]] boys when their tribes revolted, and then distributed them as eunuch slaves as gifts to various officials.<ref name="google16"/>

At the end of the Ming dynasty, there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 ''huànguān'', or 太監 ''tàijiàn'') employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the [[Forbidden City]].

The last imperial eunuch in China was [[Sun Yaoting]] who died in 1996.

====Non-Han peoples in China====
The [[Khitan people]] adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a [[nomad]]ic [[Mongols|Mongolic people]] and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.<ref>[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.](Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document)</ref> When the Khitan founded the [[Liao dynasty]] they developed a [[harem]] system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. All of the eunuchs captured were ethnic Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plains]] that came from two sources. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]. Another source was during their war with the Chinese [[Song dynasty]]: the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and emasculate them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager [[Xiao Chuo]] (Chengtian) played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.<ref>[http://www.docin.com/p-220201686.html 祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.] (Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)</ref>

They either died in prison in [[Lanzhou]], Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious "sedition", or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serving as [[eunuch]] slaves to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated.<ref>{{cite book |via= Google Books| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA83|title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|year=1880|page=83}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |via= Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA145|title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|year=1888|publisher=D.

===Korea===
The eunuchs of Korea, called {{lang|ko|Naesi}} (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in [[Goryeosa]] ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the [[Goryeo]] period. In 1392, with the founding of the [[Joseon dynasty]], the {{lang|ko|Naesi}} system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of {{lang|ko|Naesi}}" (내시부, 內侍府).<ref name="Naesi">{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=367722 |title=내시 : 지식백과 |language=ko |website=100.naver.com |access-date=17 December 2015}}</ref>

The {{lang|ko|Naesi}} system included two ranks, those of {{lang|ko|Sangseon}} (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of {{lang|ko|Naesi}}"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and {{lang|ko|Naegwan}} (내관, 內官, "Common official {{lang|ko|naesi}}"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 {{lang|ko|naesi}} in total served the palace in Joseon dynasty period.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese performed castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|author= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper= Zing News|date= 18 July 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130721110844/http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|archive-date= 21 July 2013|url-status= dead}}</ref> The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied, and others would pin him down on a table.

In the [[Lê dynasty]] the Vietnamese Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/miscellaneouspa00irelgoog|title=Miscellaneous papers relating to Indo-China: reprinted for the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society from Dalrymple's "Oriental Repertory," and the "Asiatic Researches" and "Journal" of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume 1|author=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that 13 Chinese men from [[Wenchang]] including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from [[Hainan]] to [[Guangdong]]'s Qin subprefecture ([[Qinzhou]]), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the [[Chenghua Emperor]]'s rule (1447–1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, [[Wu Rui (eunuch)|Wu Rui]] (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the [[Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long|Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long]]. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]]. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] magistrate and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the palace.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chinese State at the Borders |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0774813334 |url=https://archive.org/details/chinesestateatbo0000unse/page/91 |author=Leo K.

Commoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam; only adult men of high social rank could be castrated. Most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality. The Vietnamese government mandated that boys born with defective genitalia were to be reported to officials, in exchange for the town being freed from mandatory labor requirements. The boy would have the option of serving as a eunuch official or serving the palace women when he became ten years old.<ref>Andaya (2006), p. 177 {{Google books|tClCMl7hswQC|The Flaming Womb: Repositioning Women in Early Modern Southeast Asia|page=177}}</ref> This law was put in place in 1838 during the Nguyễn dynasty.<ref>Woodside (1971), p. 66 {{Google books|0LgSI9UQNpwC|Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Nguyen and Ch'ing Civil Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|page=66}}</ref> The only males allowed inside the Forbidden City at [[Huế]] were the Emperor and his eunuchs.<ref>Fodor's (2012), p. 31 {{Google books|j6EtDnQnnvAC|Fodor's See It Vietnam, 3rd Edition|page=31}}</ref>

==Prevention of crime==
Voluntary or mandated preventative chemical or surgical castration has been in practice in many countries—reports are available from American and European countries in particular for over eighty years (chemical for circa thirty)—as an option for treatment for people who have broken laws of a sexual nature, allowing them to return to the community from otherwise lengthy detentions.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/alabama-chemical-castration/591226/ |title=Alabama Moves to State-Ordered Castration |access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.

===Criticism===
Some criminologists argue that the reported lower recidivism rates in castrated male sex offenders compared to non-castrated ones does not conclusively prove that it is a biological effect of castration, but might be explained by other factors. One suggested factor from [[game theory]] is that men who are willing to accept castration to get a shorter prison sentence are those who value freedom from prison higher than men who are not willing to pay the price for freedom in the form of their testicles. This hypothesis could explain their apparent lower recidivism as a result of working harder to conceal the evidence for their crimes, and argue that their parole is a danger of releasing offenders who only hide their crimes more efficiently and are not any less likely to commit new crimes. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].<ref>Christine Horne, Michael J.

==Music==
{{Main|Castrato}}
In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to develop a special high [[Register (music)|voice]] and to prevent their voices breaking at [[puberty]]. The first documents mentioning ''[[castrato|castrati]]'' are Italian church records from the 1550s.<ref name="one">John Rosselli, "Castrato" article in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2001.</ref> In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. [[Mozart]]'s ''Exultate Jubilate'', [[Gregorio Allegri|Allegri]]'s ''[[Gregorio Allegri#The Miserere|Miserere]]'' and other pieces from this period now sung by [[soprano]]s and countertenors were written for ''castrati''. Some of the alto parts of [[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]] were first sung by a ''castrato''. ''Castrati'' include [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]], [[Giovanni Carestini|Carestini]], and [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]]. The last true ''castrato'' was [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) who served in the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Samantha|title=All mouth and no trousers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/aug/05/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures|website=The Guardian|date=5 August 2002}}</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of ''castrati''. In modern times, the Mexican [[Javier Medina]] is the only professional opera singer who can perform as a castrato, since he had an involuntary chemical castration, as a result of a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74d57b3c-a7b8-11dd-865e-000077b07658.html |title=Javier Medina – 'I'm A Natural Castrato' |work=Financial Times |access-date=22 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316183416/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74d57b3c-a7b8-11dd-865e-000077b07658.html |archive-date=16 March 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Religion==

===Hinduism===
In South Asia, many [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]] live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities, led by a guru. The power of the hijras as a sexually ambiguous category can only be understood in the religious context of Hinduism. In some Hindu beliefs, ritual, and art, the power of the combined man/woman, or androgyne, is a frequent and significant theme. [[Bahuchara Mata]], the main object of hijra veneration, is specifically associated with transvestism and transgenderism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Hijra-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html |title=Religion and expressive culture – Hijra |publisher=Everyculture.com |access-date=17 August 2012}}</ref>

===Christianity===
In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus of Nazareth]] mentions castration in a discussion about avoiding adultery and divorce that some are involuntarily castrated or born that way, while some others "make themselves eunuchs" willingly out of a desire to be chaste ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1–12|KJV}}). Given Jesus' frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole, e.g. {{bibleverse||Luke|9:62|KJV}}, the Catholic Church has broadly discouraged any understanding of this passage as recommending literal "self-castration". That is consistent with Jesus' claims (as a rabbi) to uphold the Law given to Moses, e.g. {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17|KJV}}, a Law which also discouraged literal castration {{bibleverse||Deut|23:1|KJV}}. However, in his own comments Jesus had no condemnation for any of the above. In {{bibleverse||Acts|8:34–8:39|KJV}}, a eunuch is baptized by [[Philip the Evangelist]], demonstrating acceptance of castrated individuals in his church.

The first canon of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD forbade clergy members to voluntarily castrate themselves "when in perfect health", but freely accepted those who had been either castrated by others against their will, castrated due to a medical sickness or necessity, or those born as eunuchs.

Paul, arguing against self-righteousness regarding [[circumcision]] in {{bibleverse||Galatians|5:12|KJV}}, says "As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!" ([[New International Version|NIV]])

Well-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:
* [[Origen]], who is reported by [[Church History (Eusebius)|Eusebius]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005}}</ref> to have castrated himself based on his reading of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} and other passages in Matthew and Mark that appear to endorse voluntary amputation to avoid sin, although there is some doubt concerning this story. [[Philip Schaff|Schaff]] considers the account genuine but cites [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Baur]] ''et al.'' in opposition.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.viii.html Eusebius' Church History Book 6, Chapter 8 Origen's Daring Deed] note 1809: "This act of Origen's has been greatly discussed, and some have even gone so far as to believe that he never committed the act ... There is no reason, however, to doubt the report, for which we have unimpeachable testimony, and which is in itself not at all surprising ..."</ref> Origen argues against such literal interpretations of the passages from Matthew and Mark in his First Principles.
* Bishop [[Melito of Sardis]] (d. ''ca'' 180), who was a [[eunuch]], according to the church history of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], though, significantly the word "virgin" was substituted in [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]' Latin translation of Eusebius.
* [[Boston Corbett]], who was inspired by this same verse {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|19:12|}} to castrate himself (Corbett was the 19th-century American soldier who is generally believed to have fired the shot that killed [[John Wilkes Booth]]).
* [[Skoptsy]], a branch of the Russian [[Spiritual Christianity]] movement founded in the 1760s.

===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] strictly forbids the castration of either humans or animals.<ref>[[Talmud]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbos]] 110b</ref> Deuteronomy 23:1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel; they are forbidden to marry or if married must divorce from their wives (though permitting the castrated to marry or remain married to female converts to Judaism). The laws of castration also apply to cases of irreversible or un-reversed vasectomy and all other cases where the flow of sperm is known to have been placed into a permanent state of dysfunction with either no hope or no desire to take the steps to repair.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ask the Rabbi: Vasectomy |url=https://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html |website=Aish.com |date=20 August 2011 |access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>

Isaiah 56:3–5 references in a positive welcoming manner eunuchs who follow after God's laws. "Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off."

According to [[Rashi]], Kham (Ham) castrated his father Noah and was cursed as a result.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Perani |first=Mauro |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110901399/html?lang=en |title=The Words of a Wise Man's Mouth are Gracious |publisher=[[De Gruyter]] |isbn=9783110901399 |volume=32 |location=[[Boston, New York]] |publication-date=2012-03-20 |pages=258 |language=en |doi=10.1515/9783110901399 |access-date=2024-04-27 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In Judaism, castrated animals are deemed unfit for [[sacrifice]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Lev|22:24|}}). Castrated members of the priestly caste are forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings and receive the priestly and Levite gifts (Lev. 21:16–24).

===Islam===
The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] as well as later [[Arab–Byzantine wars|conquests in the Byzantine Empire]] and [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|India]] brought them into contact with eunuchs. By the eighth century, the palaces of the caliphs were staffed with many eunuch slaves which sold at a premium.  A regular trade in eunuchs developed with slaves being taken to locations in Spain or Africa to be castrated, as the practice of castration was forbidden for Muslims. Eunuchs were used as harem supervisors, as mediators or servile roles, but they could also rise to be trusted advisors or military commanders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roscoe |first1=Will |last2=Murray |first2=Stephen |year=1997 |title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature |publisher=NYU Press}}</ref>{{rp|75}}

In [[Islam]], castration is considered a sin and strictly forbidden, whether one performs it on oneself or on another.<ref>As Abdullah ibn Mas'ood said, "We were on a campaign with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and we had no women with us. We said: Why don't we get ourselves castrated? But he forbade us to do that."{{cite book |last1=Al-Bukhari |first1=Imam Muhammad |title=Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 7 |chapter=Book 62, Hadith 13 |url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5075|language=en}}</ref> In the [[History of slavery in the Muslim world|history of slavery in the Muslim]] world, a fair proportion of male slaves were imported as eunuch. Levy states that according to the Quran and Islamic traditions, such emasculation was objectionable. Some jurists such as [[Qadi Baydawi|al-Baydawi]] considered castration to be mutilation, stipulating laws to prevent it. However, in practice, emasculation was frequent.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Morroe |last2=Levy |first2=Reuben |date=August 1957 |title=The Social Structure of Islam. |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2089185 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=479 |doi=10.2307/2089185 |jstor=2089185 |issn=0003-1224}}</ref> In eighteenth-century Mecca, the majority of eunuchs were in the service of the mosques.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Brunschvig |first=Robert |date=1962 |title=Metiers vils en Islam |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1595118 |journal=Studia Islamica |issue=16 |pages=41–60 |doi=10.2307/1595118 |jstor=1595118 |issn=0585-5292}}</ref>

==Medical consequences==
{{See also|Neutering#Health and behavioral effects}}
 
A subject of castration who is altered before the onset of puberty will retain a high voice, as well as the effects of hypogonadism, which include non-muscular build, an infantile penis, a lack of a beard, more developed subcutaneous fat. He may be taller than average, with long limbs, so called "eunuchoid appearance", as the production of sex hormones in puberty—more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone—stops long bone growth in a process called osseous maturation. The subject may lack the male distribution of axillary hair, and may develop [[pubic hair]] distributed in female pattern. They may have a low sex drive or none at all.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peschel |first1=Enid Rhodes |last2=Peschel |first2=Richard E. |title=Medical Insights into the Castrati in Opera |journal=American Scientist |date=1987 |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=578–583 |jstor=27854886 |bibcode=1987AmSci..75..578R |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27854886.pdf |access-date=30 January 2024 |issn=0003-0996}}</ref>

Castration stops the progression of [[male pattern baldness]]. However, hair regrowth – if it occurs at all – may be limited to hair that was lost shortly before castration.<ref>{{Cite journal

[[File:Mule castration emasculator during haemostasis.jpg|A mule being castrated|thumb|right]]

Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding.
Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]]; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]] such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.

Male horses are usually castrated ([[gelding|gelded]]) using [[emasculator]]s, because [[Stallion (horse)|stallions]] are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male [[mule]]s, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as [[oxen]].
[[Selective breeding|Breeding]] individuals are kept [[entire (animal)|entire]] and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

Livestock may be castrated when used for food to prevent indiscriminate breeding, control aggression, and improve meat and carcass quality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Needham |first1=T. |last2=Lambrechts |first2=H. |last3=Hoffman |first3=L.C. |title=Castration of male livestock and the potential of immunocastration to improve animal we |journal=South African Journal of Animal Science |date=9 November 2017 |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=731 |doi=10.4314/sajas.v47i6.1 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In [[domestic pig]]s the undesirable odour or taint of uncastrated males, called [[boar taint]], is caused by [[androstenone]] and [[skatole]] concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity.<ref name="GEN">[http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm Genetics of Boar Taint: Implications for the Future Use of Intact Males] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031092222/http://mark.asci.ncsu.edu/nsif/99proc/squires.htm |date=31 October 2007 }}</ref> Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management.<ref name="pigsite">{{cite web |url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |title=Managing Boar Taint: Focus on Genetic Markers |publisher=The Pig Site |date=12 August 2007 |access-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150415192046/http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3245/managing-boar-taint-focus-on-genetic-markers/ |archive-date=15 April 2015 }}</ref> It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers.<ref name="PSU">[http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210034407/http://www.research.psu.edu/ipo/faculty_staff/disclosures/Greger_97_1751.html|date=10 February 2009}}</ref> Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity.<ref name = "PSU"/> Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/articles/3950/mythbusting-boar-taint/ |title=Mythbusting Boar Taint|publisher=The Pig Site |access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref>

In the case of pets, castration is usually called [[neutering]], and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called [[spaying]]). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, and also prostate problems are somewhat common in castrated male dogs when they get older.<ref name=Teske>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00261-7 |title=Canine prostate carcinoma: epidemiological evidence of an increased risk in castrated dogs |date=2002 |last1=Teske |first1=E. |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=197 |pages=251–5 |pmid=12431819 |first2=E.

* [[Pig#Pig vocabulary|Barrow]] (pig)
* [[Cattle#Terminology|Bullock]] (cattle)
* [[Capon]] (chicken)
* [[Gelding]] (horse)
* Gib (cat, ferret)
* [[Ox]] (cattle) (Castration performed on mature bull)
* Stag (cattle, sheep)
* [[Cattle#Terminology|Steer]] (cattle) (Castration performed on young calf)
* [[Wikt:wether|Wether]] (sheep, goat)

An incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a ''rig''.

The term ''stag'' is used for a male animal castrated after the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of [[sexual maturity]].

[[File:Elastrator rings.JPG|thumb|Rubber rings and pliers used in [[elastration]]]]
Methods of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] castration include instant [[surgical]] removal, the use of an [[elastrator]] tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a [[Burdizzo]] tool or emasculators to crush the [[spermatic cord]]s and disrupt the blood supply, [[pharmacological]] [[Injection (medicine)|injections]] and [[implant (medicine)|implants]] and [[immunological]] techniques to [[inoculation|inoculate]] the animal against his own [[sex hormones|sexual hormones]].

Certain animals, like horses and [[swine]], are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.

Castration of cattle has historically been done without pain medications. All methods of castration cause pain and distress, which can be minimized by castrating as early as possible, preferably within the first week of life. The Canadian Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Beef Cattle requires that, as of 2018, calves older than six months be castrated using pain control.<ref>Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Beef Cattle. 2013.
www.nfacc.ca/codes-of-practice/beef-cattle
</ref>

In veterinary practice an "open" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A "closed" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.
