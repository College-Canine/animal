==Signs and symptoms==
Hypertension is rarely accompanied by [[Signs and symptoms|symptoms]], and its identification is usually through health  [[Screening (medicine)|screening]], or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem. Some people with high blood pressure report [[headache]]s (particularly at the [[Occiput|back of the head]] and in the morning), as well as [[lightheadedness]], [[vertigo]], [[tinnitus]] (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting episodes]].<ref name=Fisher2005>{{cite book |vauthors=Fisher ND, Williams GH |veditors=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|url=https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00kasp |url-access=limited |edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-139140-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/harrisonsprincip00kasp/page/n1491 1463]–1481 |chapter=Hypertensive vascular disease|display-editors=etal}}</ref> These symptoms, however, might be related to associated [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] rather than the high blood pressure itself.<ref name=Stress2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall IJ, Wolfe CD, McKevitt C | title = Lay perspectives on hypertension and drug adherence: systematic review of qualitative research | journal = The BMJ | volume = 345 | pages = e3953 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22777025 | pmc = 3392078 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e3953 }}</ref>

===Secondary hypertension===
{{Main|Secondary hypertension}}
Secondary hypertension is hypertension due to an identifiable cause, and may result in certain specific additional signs and symptoms. For example, as well as causing high blood pressure, [[Cushing's syndrome]] frequently causes [[Abdominal obesity|truncal obesity]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Truncal obesity (Concept Id: C4551560) – MedGen – NCBI |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/1637490#Definition |access-date=2022-04-24 |website=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |language=en}}</ref> [[glucose intolerance]], [[moon face]], a hump of fat behind the neck and shoulders (referred to as a buffalo hump), and purple abdominal [[stretch marks]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite book | vauthors = O'Brien E, Beevers DG, Lip GY |title=ABC of hypertension |publisher=BMJ Books |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-3061-5 }}</ref> [[Hyperthyroidism]] frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[exophthalmos|bulging eyes]], and tremor. [[Renal artery stenosis]] (RAS) may be associated with a localized abdominal [[bruit]] to the left or right of the midline (unilateral RAS), or in both locations (bilateral RAS). [[Coarctation of the aorta]] frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent [[femoral artery|femoral arterial pulses]]. [[Pheochromocytoma]] may cause abrupt episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, [[palpitation]]s, [[Pallor|pale appearance]], and [[Diaphoresis|excessive sweating]].<ref name="ABC"/>

===Hypertensive crisis===
{{main|Hypertensive crisis}}
Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 mmHg or diastolic of 120 mmHg) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis.<ref>{{Cite web | work = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|date=2021-01-21 |title=High Blood Pressure – Understanding the Silent Killer |url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/high-blood-pressure-understanding-silent-killer |publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration |language=en}}</ref> Hypertensive crisis is categorized as either [[hypertensive urgency]] or [[hypertensive emergency]], according to the absence or presence of end organ damage, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez MA, Kumar SK, De Caro M | title = Hypertensive crisis | journal = Cardiology in Review | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–107 | date = 2010-04-01 | pmid = 20160537 | doi = 10.1097/CRD.0b013e3181c307b7 | s2cid = 34137590 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Hypertensive Crisis|url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Hypertensive-Crisis_UCM_301782_Article.jsp|website = heart.org|access-date = 2015-07-25|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725220209/http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Hypertensive-Crisis_UCM_301782_Article.jsp|archive-date = 25 July 2015}}</ref>

Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, healthcare providers should attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. [[Secondary hypertension]] is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by [[kidney disease]]. Primary or [[essential hypertension]] is more common in adolescents and adults and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.<ref name="pmid16719248">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luma GB, Spiotta RT | title = Hypertension in children and adolescents | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 1558–1568 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16719248 }}</ref> Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the [[Human heart|heart]], [[Human eyes|eyes]], and [[kidney]]s.

Initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]]. Serum [[creatinine]] is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension. Serum creatinine alone may overestimate [[glomerular filtration rate]] and the 2003 JNC7 guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the [[Modification of Diet in Renal Disease]] (MDRD) formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).<ref name="JNC7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chobanian AV, Bakris GL, Black HR, Cushman WC, Green LA, Izzo JL, Jones DW, Materson BJ, Oparil S, Wright JT, Roccella EJ | title = Seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure | journal = Hypertension | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1206–1252 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14656957 | doi = 10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c2 | collaboration = Joint National Committee on Prevention, National High Blood Pressure Education Program Coordinating Committee | doi-access = free }}</ref> eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain [[Antihypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive]] drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for [[proteinuria|protein]] is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. [[Electrocardiogram]] (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A [[chest X-ray]] or an [[echocardiogram]] may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart.<ref name="ABC"/>

The author assumed the mid score of 15 or less is not associated with true hypertension, it can be reactive, white-coat or unreliable measurement.

===Medications===
Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as [[antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive medication]]s, are available for treating hypertension.

First-line medications for hypertension include [[Thiazide|thiazide-diuretics]], [[calcium channel blockers]], [[angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor]]s (ACE inhibitors), and [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker|angiotensin receptor blockers]] (ARBs).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JM, Musini VM, Gill R | title = First-line drugs for hypertension | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2018 | issue = 4 | pages = CD001841 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29667175 | pmc = 6513559 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001841.pub3 }}</ref><ref name=JNC8/> These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use together); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels,<ref name=JNC8/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JM, Heran BS, Wright JM | title = Blood pressure lowering efficacy of diuretics as second-line therapy for primary hypertension | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD007187 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19821398 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007187.pub2 | s2cid = 73993182 }}</ref> although the evidence for first-line combination therapy is not strong enough.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garjón J, Saiz LC, Azparren A, Gaminde I, Ariz MJ, Erviti J | title = First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD010316 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32026465 | pmc = 7002970 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010316.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Hypertension Group }}</ref> Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.<ref name="Go2013"/> Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.<ref name=":5"/> Withdrawal of such medications in the elderly can be considered by healthcare professionals,  because there is no strong evidence of an effect on mortality, [[myocardial infarction]], or [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeve E, Jordan V, Thompson W, Sawan M, Todd A, Gammie TM, Hopper I, Hilmer SN, Gnjidic D | display-authors = 6 | title = Withdrawal of antihypertensive drugs in older people | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2020 | issue = 6 | pages = CD012572 | date = June 2020 | pmid = 32519776 | pmc = 7387859 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012572.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Hypertension Group }}</ref>

Previously, [[beta-blockers]] such as [[atenolol]] were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to that of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiysonge CS, Bradley HA, Volmink J, Mayosi BM, Opie LH | title = Beta-blockers for hypertension | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD002003 | date = January 2017 | issue = 1 | pmid = 28107561 | pmc = 5369873 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002003.pub5 }}</ref>

The prescription of antihypertensive medication for children with hypertension has limited evidence. There is limited evidence which compare it with placebo and shows modest effect to blood pressure in short term. Administration of higher dose did not make the reduction of blood pressure greater.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaturvedi S, Lipszyc DH, Licht C, Craig JC, Parekh R | title = Pharmacological interventions for hypertension in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD008117 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24488616 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008117.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Hypertension Group | pmc = 11056235 }}</ref>

===Resistant hypertension===

=== Refractory hypertension ===
{{Main|Refractory hypertension}}

Refractory hypertension is characterized by uncontrolled elevated [[blood pressure]] unmitigated by five or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a long-acting [[thiazide-like diuretic]], a [[calcium channel blocker]], and a blocker of the [[renin-angiotensin system]].<ref name="acel">{{cite journal | vauthors = Acelajado MC, Hughes ZH, Oparil S, Calhoun DA | title = Treatment of resistant and refractory hypertension | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 124 | issue = 7 | pages = 1061–1070 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30920924 | pmc = 6469348 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312156 }}</ref> People with refractory hypertension typically have increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and are at high risk for more severe cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality.<ref name=acel/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dudenbostel T, Siddiqui M, Oparil S, Calhoun DA | title = Refractory hypertension: A novel phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure | journal = Hypertension | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 1085–1092 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27091893 | pmc = 5425297 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.06587 }}</ref>

===Non-modulating===
Non-modulating essential hypertension is a form of [[salt]]-sensitive hypertension, where [[sodium]] intake does not modulate either [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] or [[Kidney|renal]] [[Vascular system|vascular]] responses to [[angiotensin II]]. Individuals with this subset have been termed non-modulators.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams GH, Hollenberg NK | title = Non-modulating essential hypertension: a subset particularly responsive to converting enzyme inhibitors | journal = Journal of Hypertension Supplement | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = S81–S87 | date = November 1985 | pmid = 3003304 }}</ref> They make up 25–30% of the hypertensive population.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = 16th | date = 2005 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York }} {{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>

===Measurement===
Modern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657), who described the circulation of blood in his book "''De motu cordis''". The English clergyman [[Stephen Hales]] made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref name=Kotchen2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotchen TA | title = Historical trends and milestones in hypertension research: a model of the process of translational research | journal = Hypertension | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 522–38 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21859967 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.177766 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, hypertension as a clinical entity came into its own with the invention of the cuff-based [[sphygmomanometer]] by [[Scipione Riva-Rocci]] in 1896.<ref>{{cite book | title=A century of arterial hypertension 1896–1996 | editor=Postel-Vinay N | pages=213 | location=Chichester | publisher=Wiley | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-471-96788-0}}</ref> This allowed easy measurement of systolic pressure in the clinic. In 1905, [[Nikolai Korotkoff]] improved the technique by describing the [[Korotkoff sounds]] that are heard when the artery is ausculted with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.<ref name=Kotchen2011/> This permitted systolic and diastolic pressure to be measured.

===Identification===
The symptoms similar to symptoms of patients with hypertensive crisis are discussed in medieval Persian medical texts in the chapter of "fullness disease".<ref name="The medieval origins of the concept of hypertension">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heydari M, Dalfardi B, Golzari SE, Habibi H, Zarshenas MM | title = The medieval origins of the concept of hypertension | journal = Heart Views | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 96–98 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25538828 | pmc = 4268622 | doi = 10.4103/1995-705X.144807 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The symptoms include headache, heaviness in the head, sluggish movements, general redness and warm to touch feel of the body, prominent, distended and tense vessels, fullness of the pulse, distension of the skin, coloured and dense urine, loss of appetite, weak eyesight, impairment of thinking, yawning, drowsiness, vascular rupture, and hemorrhagic stroke.<ref name="pmid25310615">{{cite journal | vauthors = Emtiazy M, Choopani R, Khodadoost M, Tansaz M, Dehghan S, Ghahremani Z | title = Avicenna's doctrine about arterial hypertension | journal = Acta medico-historica Adriatica | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–162 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25310615 }}</ref> Fullness disease was presumed to be due to an excessive amount of blood within the blood vessels.

Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1808 and especially [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] in 1836.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by [[Frederick Akbar Mahomed]] (1849–1884).<ref>{{cite book |editor=Swales JD|title=Manual of hypertension |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=xiii |isbn=978-0-86542-861-4}}</ref>

Until the 1990s, systolic hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or greater.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wilking |first=Spencer Van B. |date=1988-12-16 |title=Determinants of Isolated Systolic Hypertension |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1988.03410230069030 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |language=en |volume=260 |issue=23 |pages=3451–3455 |doi=10.1001/jama.1988.03410230069030 |pmid=3210285 |issn=0098-7484}}</ref> In 1993, the WHO/ISH guidelines defined 140 mmHg as the threshold for hypertension.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1993 |title=1993 guidelines for the management of mild hypertension: memorandum from a WHO/ISH meeting. |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=503–517 |issn=0042-9686 |pmc=2393474 |pmid=8261554}}</ref>

===Treatment===
Historically the treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by [[bloodletting]] or the application of [[leech]]es.<ref name="pmid1744849">
{{cite journal | vauthors = Esunge PM | title = From blood pressure to hypertension: the history of research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | pages = 621 | date = October 1991 | doi = 10.1177/014107689108401019 | pmid = 1744849 | pmc = 1295564 }}
</ref> This was advocated by The [[Yellow Emperor]] of China, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], and [[Hippocrates]].<ref name="pmid1744849"/> The therapeutic approach for the treatment of hard pulse disease included changes in lifestyle (staying away from anger and [[sexual intercourse]]) and dietary program for patients (avoiding the consumption of [[wine]], meat, and pastries, reducing the volume of food in a meal, maintaining a low-energy diet and the dietary usage of [[spinach]] and [[vinegar]]).

In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the [[rice diet]]<ref name="pmid1744849"/>), [[sympathectomy]] (surgical ablation of parts of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref name=Dustan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dustan HP, Roccella EJ, Garrison HH | title = Controlling hypertension.

The first chemical for hypertension, [[sodium thiocyanate]], was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> Several other agents were developed after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the most popular and reasonably effective of which were [[tetramethylammonium chloride]], [[hexamethonium]], [[hydralazine]], and [[reserpine]] (derived from the medicinal plant ''[[Rauvolfia serpentina]]''). None of these were well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons HH, Hoobler SW | title = Experiences with tetraethylammonium chloride in hypertension | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 136 | issue = 9 | pages = 608–613 | date = February 1948 | pmid = 18899127 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1948.02890260016005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakris GL, Frohlich ED | title = The evolution of antihypertensive therapy: an overview of four decades of experience | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 1595–1608 | date = December 1989 | pmid = 2685075 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(89)90002-8 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents.

[[The World Health Organization]] has identified hypertension, or high blood pressure, as the leading cause of [[cardiovascular]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name="pmid17534457"/> [[The World Hypertension League]] (WHL), an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, recognized that more than 50% of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition.<ref name="pmid17534457">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chockalingam A | title = Impact of World Hypertension Day | journal = The Canadian Journal of Cardiology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 517–519 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17534457 | pmc = 2650754 | doi = 10.1016/S0828-282X(07)70795-X }}</ref> To address this problem, the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated 17 May of each year as [[World Hypertension Day]] ([[World Hypertension Day|WHD]]). Over the past three years, more national societies have been engaging in WHD and have been innovative in their activities to get the message to the public. In 2007, there was record participation from 47 member countries of the WHL. During the week of WHD, all these countries – in partnership with their local governments, professional societies, nongovernmental organizations and private industries – promoted hypertension awareness among the public through several [[Mass media|media]] and public rallies. Using [[mass media]] such as Internet and television, the message reached more than 250 million people. As the momentum picks up year after year, the WHL is confident that almost all the estimated 1.5 billion people affected by elevated blood pressure can be reached.<ref name="pmid18548140">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chockalingam A | title = World Hypertension Day and global awareness | journal = The Canadian Journal of Cardiology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 441–444 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18548140 | pmc = 2643187 | doi = 10.1016/S0828-282X(08)70617-2 }}</ref>

===Economics===
High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers in US. The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion.<ref name = AHA2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lloyd-Jones D, Adams RJ, Brown TM, Carnethon M, Dai S, De Simone G, etal | title = Heart disease and stroke statistics – 2010 update: a report from the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 121 | issue = 7 | pages = e46–e215 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20019324 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192667 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In the US 80% of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, 71% take some antihypertensive medication, but only 48% of people aware that they have hypertension adequately control it.<ref name = AHA2010 /> Adequate management of hypertension can be hampered by inadequacies in the diagnosis, treatment, or control of high blood pressure.<ref name="pmid19124418">{{cite journal | vauthors = Alcocer L, Cueto L | title = Hypertension, a health economics perspective | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–155 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 19124418 | doi = 10.1177/1753944708090572 | s2cid = 31053059 }}</ref> [[Health care providers]] face many obstacles to achieving blood pressure control, including resistance to taking multiple medications to reach blood pressure goals. People also face the challenges of adhering to medicine schedules and making lifestyle changes. Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of death due to heart disease and stroke, the development of other debilitating conditions, and the cost associated with advanced medical care.<ref name="The Economic Impact of Hypertension">{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott WJ | title = The economic impact of hypertension | journal = Journal of Clinical Hypertension | volume = 5 | issue = 3 Suppl 2 | pages = 3–13 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 12826765 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-6175.2003.02463.x | pmc = 8099256 | s2cid = 26799038 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid18345711">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coca A | title = Economic benefits of treating high-risk hypertension with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (blockers) | journal = Clinical Drug Investigation | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 211–220 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18345711 | doi = 10.2165/00044011-200828040-00002 | s2cid = 8294060 }}</ref>

==Other animals==
Hypertension in cats is indicated with a systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg, with [[amlodipine]] the usual first-line treatment. A cat with a systolic blood pressure above 170 mmHg is considered hypertensive. If a cat has other problems such as any kidney disease or retina detachment then a blood pressure below 160 mmHg may also need to be monitored.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SS, Sparkes AH, Briscoe K, Carter J, Sala SC, Jepson RE, Reynolds BS, Scansen BA | title = ISFM Consensus Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Hypertension in Cats | journal = Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–303 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28245741 | doi = 10.1177/1098612X17693500 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Normal blood pressure in dogs can differ substantially between breeds but hypertension is often diagnosed if systolic blood pressure is above 160 mmHg particularly if this is associated with target organ damage.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Acierno MJ, Brown S, Coleman AE, Jepson RE, Papich M, Stepien RL, Syme HM | title = ACVIM consensus statement: Guidelines for the identification, evaluation, and management of systemic hypertension in dogs and cats | journal = Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1803–1822 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30353952 | pmc = 6271319 | doi = 10.1111/jvim.15331 }}</ref> Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium channel blockers are often used to treat hypertension in dogs, although other drugs may be indicated for specific conditions causing high blood pressure.<ref name=":6"/>
