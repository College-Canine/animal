Serotonin is produced in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), specifically in the [[brainstem]]'s [[raphe nuclei]], the skin's [[Merkel cells]], [[pulmonary neuroendocrine cell]]s and the tongue's [[taste bud|taste receptor cells]].

The serotonin is secreted [[lumen (anatomy)|luminally]] and [[basolateral]]ly, which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of [[myenteric]] neurons and [[gastrointestinal motility]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yano JM, Yu K, Donaldson GP, et al. | title = Indigenous bacteria from the gut microbiota regulate host serotonin biosynthesis | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–276 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25860609 | pmc = 4393509 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.047 }}</ref> The remainder is synthesized in [[Serotonin|serotonergic]] [[neuron]]s of the CNS, where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, [[appetite]], and [[sleep]].

Serotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a [[clot]], they release serotonin, where it can serve as a [[vasoconstrictor]] or a vasodilator while regulating [[hemostasis]] and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting [[endothelial]] [[smooth muscle]] directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin&nbsp;II and norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium{{snd}}such as [[atherosclerosis]] or chronic [[hypertension]]. In normal physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells, and the inhibition of release of norepinephrine from [[Adrenergic nerve fibre|adrenergic nerves]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vanhoutte PM|title=Serotonin and the vascular wall|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|volume=14|issue=2|pages=189–203|date=February 1987|doi=10.1016/0167-5273(87)90008-8|pmid=3818135}}</ref> Serotonin is also a [[growth factor]] for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]].

Biochemically, the [[indoleamine]] molecule derives from the amino acid [[tryptophan]]. Serotonin is metabolized mainly to [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]], chiefly by the [[liver]].
Several classes of [[antidepressant]]s, such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs), interfere with the normal [[reuptake|reabsorption]] of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the [[synapse]]s.

===Cellular effects===
Serotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors.<ref name=":7" />

Metabolism involves first [[oxidation]] by [[monoamine oxidase]] to the corresponding [[aldehyde]]. The rate-limiting step is hydride transfer from serotonin to the flavin cofactor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prah A, Purg M, Stare J, et al. | title = How Monoamine Oxidase A Decomposes Serotonin: An Empirical Valence Bond Simulation of the Reactive Step | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 124 | issue = 38 | pages = 8259–8265 | date = September 2020 | pmid = 32845149 | pmc = 7520887 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c06502 }}</ref> There follows oxidation by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] ({{nowrap|5-HIAA}}), the [[indole]] acetic-acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.

====Receptors====
{{Main|5-HT receptor}}
The 5-HT receptors, the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of [[Neuron|nerve cells]] and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the [[endogenous]] [[ligand]] and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and [[Psychedelics|psychedelic drugs]]. Except for the [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]], a ligand-gated [[ion channel]], all other 5-HT receptors are [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an [[intracellular]] [[second messenger]] cascade.<ref name="pmid18571247">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hannon J, Hoyer D | title = Molecular biology of 5-HT receptors | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 198–213 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18571247 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.03.020 | s2cid = 46043982 }}</ref>

====Termination====
Serotonergic action is terminated primarily via [[reuptake|uptake]] of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific [[monoamine transporter]] for 5-HT, [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]], on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including [[cocaine]], [[dextromethorphan]] (an [[antitussive]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs). A 2006 study found that a significant portion of 5-HT's synaptic clearance is due to the selective activity of the [[plasma membrane monoamine transporter]] (PMAT) which actively transports the molecule across the membrane and back into the presynaptic cell.<ref name="pmid 1828907">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou M, Engel K, Wang J | title = Evidence for significant contribution of a newly identified monoamine transporter (PMAT) to serotonin uptake in the human brain | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–154 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17046718 | pmc = 1828907 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.09.008 }}</ref>

In contrast to the high affinity of SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent ''K''<sub>m</sub> of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin, which is approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport "capacity" than SERT, "resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT ... in heterologous expression systems."<ref name="pmid 1828907" /> The study also suggests that the administration of SSRIs such as [[fluoxetine]] and [[sertraline]] may be associated with an inhibitory effect on PMAT activity when used at higher than normal dosages ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] test values used in trials were 3–4 fold higher than typical prescriptive dosage).

====Serotonylation====
{{Main|Serotonylation}}
Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins.<ref name="pmid19859528"/> This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells ([[thrombocyte]]s) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called [[GTPase]]s that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by [[exocytosis]].<ref name="pmid14697203">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walther DJ, Peter JU, Winter S, et al. | title = Serotonylation of small GTPases is a signal transduction pathway that triggers platelet alpha-granule release | journal = Cell | volume = 115 | issue = 7 | pages = 851–862 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14697203 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01014-6 | s2cid = 16847296 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.<ref name="pmid19859528"/>

===Nervous system===

[[File:Pubmed equitativa hormonal.png|thumb|right|alt= In this drawing of the brain, the serotonergic system is red and the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is blue. There is one collection of serotonergic neurons in the upper brainstem that sends [[axon]]s upwards to the whole cerebrum, and one collection next to the cerebellum that sends axons downward to the spinal cord. Slightly forward the upper serotonergic neurons is the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), which contains dopaminergic neurons. These neurons' axons then connect to the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[hippocampus]], and the [[frontal cortex]]. Over the VTA is another collection of dopaminergic cells, the [[substansia nigra]], which send axons to the [[striatum]]. |Serotonin system, contrasted with the [[Mesolimbic pathway|dopamine system]]]]

The neurons of the [[raphe nuclei]] are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Frazer A, Hensler JG | veditors = Siegel GJ, Agranoff, Bernard W, Fisher SK, Albers RW, Uhler MD |title = Basic Neurochemistry | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=bnchm|edition = Sixth|year = 1999|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn = 978-0-397-51820-3|chapter = Understanding the neuroanatomical organization of serotonergic cells in the brain provides insight into the functions of this neurotransmitter|chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=books&doptcmdl=GenBookHL&term=raphe+AND+serotonin+release+AND+bnchm%5Bbook%5D+AND+160428%5Buid%5D&rid=bnchm.section.946#949|quote = In 1964, Dahlstrom and Fuxe (discussed in [2]), using the [[Falck-Hillarp technique]] of histofluorescence, observed that the majority of serotonergic soma are found in cell body groups, which previously had been designated as the Raphe nuclei.|editor-link1 = George J. Siegel}}</ref> There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1–B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the ''nuclei raphes lineares'' into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the [[brainstem]], and centered on the [[reticular formation]].<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Binder MD, Hirokawa N |title=encyclopedia of neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-23735-8|page=705}}</ref><ref>The raphe nuclei group of [[neurons]] are located along the [[reticular formation|brain stem]] from the labels '[[mesencephalon|Mid Brain]]' to '[[medulla oblongata|Oblongata]]', centered on the [[pons]]. ([[:Image:Gray715.png|See relevant image]].)</ref> Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a [[neurotransmitter system]] reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the [[cerebellum]] and [[spinal cord]], while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.

====Ultrastructure and function====
The serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively. The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.<ref>{{cite book | veditors = Müller CP, Jacobs BL |title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin |date=2009 |publisher= Academic |location=London |isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=51–59|edition=1st}}</ref>

The serotonergic pathway is involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity. Pharmacological manipulation suggests that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli. Animal models suggest that kainate signaling negatively regulates serotonin actions in the retina, with possible implications for the control of the visual system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Passos AD, Herculano AM, Oliveira KR, de Lima SM, Rocha FA, Freitas HR, da Silva Sampaio L, Figueiredo DP, da Costa Calaza K, de Melo Reis RA, do Nascimento JL | display-authors = 6 | title = Regulation of the Serotonergic System by Kainate in the Avian Retina | journal = Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 1039–1049 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31197744 | doi = 10.1007/s10571-019-00701-8 | s2cid = 189763144 }}</ref> The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the "descending inhibitory pathway" that may be relevant to a disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Serotonin in Pain and Pain Control | vauthors = Sommer C | veditors = Müller CP, Jacobs BL |title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=457–460|edition=1st}}</ref>

====Microanatomy====
Serotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (>20&nbsp;nm) to activate [[5-HT receptor]]s located on the [[dendrite]]s, cell bodies, and [[presynaptic terminal]]s of adjacent neurons.

When humans smell food, dopamine is released to [[incentive salience|increase the appetite]]. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates [[5-HT2C receptor]]s on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain,<ref name="pmid19178394">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl SM, Mignon L, Meyer JM | title = Which comes first: atypical antipsychotic treatment or cardiometabolic risk? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–179 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19178394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01334.x | s2cid = 24035040 | doi-access = free }}</ref> especially in people with a low number of receptors.<ref name="pmid15741483">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckland PR, Hoogendoorn B, Guy CA, et al. | title = Low gene expression conferred by association of an allele of the 5-HT2C receptor gene with antipsychotic-induced weight gain | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 3 | pages = 613–615 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15741483 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.613 }}</ref> The expression of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the [[hippocampus]] follows a [[circadian rhythm|diurnal rhythm]],<ref name="pmid9151722">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes MC, French KL, Seckl JR | title = Dysregulation of diurnal rhythms of serotonin 5-HT2C and corticosteroid receptor gene expression in the hippocampus with food restriction and glucocorticoids | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 4056–4065 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9151722 | pmc = 6573558 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-11-04056.1997 }}</ref> just as the serotonin release in the [[ventromedial nucleus]], which is characterised by a peak at morning when the motivation to eat is strongest.<ref name="pmid2197074">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leibowitz SF | title = The role of serotonin in eating disorders | journal = Drugs | volume = 39 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = 33–48 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2197074 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-199000393-00005 | s2cid = 8612545 }}</ref>

In [[macaque]]s, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin in the brain as subordinate males and females (measured by the concentration of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid|5-HIAA]] in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF)). Dominance status and CSF serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males, but not dominant females has not yet been established.<ref>McGuire, Michael (2013) "Believing, the neuroscience of fantasies, fears, and confictions" (Prometius Books)</ref>

===Outside the nervous system===

====Digestive tract (emetic)====
Serotonin regulates gastrointestinal (GI) function. The gut is surrounded by [[enterochromaffin cell]]s, which release serotonin in response to food in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the [[Hepatic portal system|veins draining the gut]] collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|vauthors=Beattie DT, Smith JA|date=May 2008|title=Serotonin pharmacology in the gastrointestinal tract: a review|journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology|volume=377|issue=3|pages=181–203|doi=10.1007/s00210-008-0276-9|pmid=18398601|s2cid=32820765}}</ref>

If irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates [[5-HT3 receptor]]s in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] that stimulate [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rang HP |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-443-07145-4}}</ref> Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to [[Radiation therapy|irradiation]] and [[chemotherapy|cancer chemotherapy]]. Drugs that [[5-HT antagonist|block 5HT3]] are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Wit R, Aapro M, Blower PR | title = Is there a pharmacological basis for differences in 5-HT3-receptor antagonist efficacy in refractory patients? | journal = Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–238 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 15838653 | doi = 10.1007/s00280-005-1033-0 | s2cid = 27576150 }}</ref>

[[PIEZO1|Piezo1]] has been shown to sense RNA in the gut and relay this information through serotonin synthesis to the bone by acting as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse ''Piezo1'' profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of ''Piezo1'' increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders.

====Organ development====
Since serotonin signals resource availability it is not surprising that it affects organ development. Many human and animal studies have shown that nutrition in early life can influence, in adulthood, such things as body fatness, blood lipids, blood pressure, [[atherosclerosis]], behavior, learning, and longevity.<ref>{{cite journal

Serotonin, in addition, evokes [[endothelium|endothelial]] [[nitric oxide synthase]] activation and stimulates, through a [[5-HT1B receptor]]-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures.{{clarify|incomprehensible to lay readers|date=December 2018}}<ref name="pmid10710124">{{cite journal | vauthors = McDuffie JE, Motley ED, Limbird LE, Maleque MA | title = 5-hydroxytryptamine stimulates phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 398–402 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10710124 | doi = 10.1097/00005344-200003000-00008 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it.

==Pharmacology==

Several classes of [[drugs]] target the 5-HT system, including some [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[antiemetic]]s, and [[migraine|antimigraine drugs]], as well as, the [[psychedelic drug]]s and [[empathogen]]s.

===Mechanism of action===

At rest, serotonin is stored within the vesicles of presynaptic neurons. When stimulated by nerve impulses, serotonin is released as a neurotransmitter into the synapse, reversibly binding to the postsynaptic receptor to induce a nerve impulse on the postsynaptic neuron. Serotonin can also bind to auto-receptors on the presynaptic neuron to regulate the synthesis and release of serotonin. Normally serotonin is taken back into the presynaptic neuron to stop its action, then reused or broken down by monoamine oxidase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuller RW | title = Pharmacology of central serotonin neurons | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 20 | pages = 111–127 | date = 1980 | pmid = 6992697 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pa.20.040180.000551 }}</ref>

===Psychedelic drugs===

===Antidepressants===
{{main|SSRI|MAOI}}
Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]]. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of [[hypertensive emergency]] triggered by foods with high [[tyramine]] content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and [[norepinephrine]]. The newer [[selective and non-selective|selective]] serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([[SSRI]]s) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Goodman LS, Brunton LL, Chabner B, Knollmann BC | title = Goodman and Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics | year = 2001 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8 | pages = 459–461 }}</ref>

====Serotonin syndrome====
{{Main|Serotonin syndrome}}
Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as [[serotonin syndrome]], with toxic and potentially fatal effects.

===Antiemetics===
Some [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]], such as [[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], and [[tropisetron]], are important [[antiemetic]] agents. They are particularly important in treating the [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] that [[Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting|occur during anticancer chemotherapy]] using [[cytotoxic drugs]]. Another application is in the treatment of [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]].

===Other===

Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]], as well as [[cardiac fibrosis|cardiac valve fibrosis]].<ref name="Baskin">{{cite book | vauthors = Baskin SI|title = Principles of cardiac toxicology|publisher = CRC Press|location = Boca Raton|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-8493-8809-5|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AW7M6jBixj4C&pg=PA626|access-date = 3 February 2010}}</ref>
In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs ([[ergotamine]] and [[methysergide]]),<ref name=Baskin/> the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs ([[fenfluramine]], [[chlorphentermine]], and [[aminorex]]), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. These include [[pergolide]] and [[cabergoline]], but not the more dopamine-specific [[lisuride]].<ref name="urluserpage.fu-berlin.de">{{cite web|url = http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hpertz/Presentation001.pdf|title = Pergolide and Cabergoline But not Lisuride Exhibit Agonist Efficacy at Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> Receptors| vauthors = Jähnichen S, Horowski R, Pertz H |access-date = 3 February 2010}}</ref>

As with fenfluramine, some of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase of one or more of the side effects described.

===Methyl-tryptamines and hallucinogens===
{{for|details on tryptamine neurotransmitters in humans|Trace amine}}
Several plants contain serotonin together with a family of related [[tryptamine]]s that are [[methylation|methylated]] at the [[amine|amino]] (NH<sub>2</sub>) and [[hydroxyl|(OH) groups]], are [[amine oxide|''N''-oxides]], or miss the OH group. These compounds do reach the brain, although some portion of them are metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase]] enzymes (mainly [[MAO-A]]) in the liver. Examples are plants from the genus ''[[Anadenanthera]]'' that are used in the [[hallucinogen]]ic [[yopo]] snuff. These compounds are widely present in the leaves of many plants, and may serve as deterrents for animal ingestion. Serotonin occurs in several mushrooms of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyler VE | title = Occurrence of serotonin in a hallucinogenic mushroom | journal = Science | volume = 128 | issue = 3326 | pages = 718 | date = September 1958 | pmid = 13580242 | doi = 10.1126/science.128.3326.718 | bibcode = 1958Sci...128..718T }}</ref>

==Comparative biology and evolution==

A series of pharmacological and behavioral experiments demonstrated that serotonin plays a key role in inducing initial behavioral gregarization (2, 80). However, serotonin is not responsible for maintaining gregarious behavior because its amount in long-term gregarious locusts is less than half that in long-term solitarious locusts (80). In ''L. migratoria'', the injection of serotonin can also slightly initiate gregarious behavior, but serotonin when accompanying crowding treatment induced more solitarious-like behavior than did serotonin injection alone (48). Significant differences in serotonin levels were not found in brain tissues between the two phases of ''L. migratoria''. A recent report by Tanaka & Nishide (97) measured attraction/avoidance behavior in ''S. gregaria'' after single and multiple injections of serotonin at different concentrations. Serotonin had only a short-term effect on the level of some locomotor activities and was not involved in the control of gregarious behavior (97). In addition, it is not clear how the neurotransmitter influences this unique behavior, because a binary logistic regression model used in these studies for the behavioral assay focused mostly on only one behavioral parameter representing an overall phase state. Obviously, behavioral phase change might involve alternative regulatory mechanisms in different locust species. Therefore, these studies demonstrate that CNS regulatory mechanisms governing initiation and maintenance of phase change are species specific and involve the interactions between these neurotransmitters.<br />Given the key roles of aminergic signaling, what are the downstream pathways involved in the establishment of long-term memory?

=== Vertebrates ===
Serotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter most known for its involvement in mood disorders in humans. It is also a widely present neuromodulator among vertebrates and invertebrates.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bacqué-Cazenave J, Bharatiya R, Barrière G, Delbecque JP, Bouguiyoud N, Di Giovanni G, Cattaert D, De Deurwaerdère P | display-authors = 6 | title = Serotonin in Animal Cognition and Behavior | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 1649 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32121267 | pmc = 7084567 | doi = 10.3390/ijms21051649 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Serotonin has been found having associations with many physiological systems such as cardiovascular, [[thermoregulation]], and behavioral functions, including: [[circadian rhythm]], appetite, aggressive and sexual behavior, sensorimotor reactivity and learning, and pain sensitivity.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucki I | title = The spectrum of behaviors influenced by serotonin | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–162 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9693387 | doi = 10.1016/s0006-3223(98)00139-5 | s2cid = 3001666 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Serotonin's function in neurological systems along with specific behaviors among vertebrates found to be strongly associated with serotonin will be further discussed. Two relevant case studies are also mentioned regarding serotonin development involving [[Teleost|teleost fish]] and [[Mouse|mice]].

In mammals, 5-HT is highly concentrated in the [[substantia nigra]], [[ventral tegmental area]] and [[raphe nuclei]]. Lesser concentrated areas include other brain regions and the spinal cord.<ref name=":1" /> 5-HT neurons are also shown to be highly branched, indicating that they are structurally prominent for influencing multiple areas of the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] at the same time, although this trend is exclusive solely to mammals.<ref name=":2" />

==== 5-HT system in vertebrates ====
[[Vertebrate]]s are multicellular organisms in the [[Chordate|phylum Chordata]] that possess a backbone and a [[nervous system]]. This includes mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, etc. In humans, the nervous system is composed of the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]], with little known about the specific mechanisms of neurotransmitters in most other vertebrates. However, it is known that while serotonin is involved in stress and behavioral responses, it is also important in [[cognitive functions]].<ref name=":1" /> Brain organization in most vertebrates includes 5-HT cells in the [[hindbrain]].<ref name=":1" /> In addition to this, 5-HT is often found in other sections of the brain in non-placental vertebrates, including the [[basal forebrain]] and [[Pretectal area|pretectum]].<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Backström T, Winberg S | title = Serotonin Coordinates Responses to Social Stress-What We Can Learn from Fish | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 11 | pages = 595 | date = 2017-10-25 | pmid = 29163002 | pmc = 5669303 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2017.00595 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Since location of serotonin receptors contribute to behavioral responses, this suggests serotonin is part of specific pathways in non-placental vertebrates that are not present in amniotic organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Berger M, Gray JA, Roth BL | title = The expanded biology of serotonin | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 355–366 | date = 2009-02-01 | pmid = 19630576 | pmc = 5864293 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.60.042307.110802 }}</ref> Teleost fish and mice are organisms most often used to study the connection between serotonin and vertebrate behavior. Both organisms show similarities in the effect of serotonin on behavior, but differ in the mechanism in which the responses occur.

===== Dogs / canine species =====
There are few studies of serotonin in dogs. One study reported serotonin values were higher at dawn than at dusk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alberghina D, Piccione G, Pumilia G, Gioè M, Rizzo M, Raffo P, Panzera M | title = Daily fluctuation of urine serotonin and cortisol in healthy shelter dogs and influence of intraspecific social exposure | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 206 | pages = 1–6 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 30898540 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.03.016 | s2cid = 81965422 }}</ref> In another study, serum 5-HT levels did not seem to be associated with dogs' behavioural response to a stressful situation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riggio G, Mariti C, Sergi V, Diverio S, Gazzano A | title = Serotonin and Tryptophan Serum Concentrations in Shelter Dogs Showing Different Behavioural Responses to a Potentially Stressful Procedure | journal = Veterinary Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 1 | date = December 2020 | pmid = 33374183 | pmc = 7824451 | doi = 10.3390/vetsci8010001 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  Urinary serotonin/creatinine ratio in bitches tended to be higher 4 weeks after surgery.

===== Teleost fish =====
Like non-placental vertebrates, teleost fish also possess 5-HT cells in other sections of the brain, including the [[basal forebrain]].<ref name=":3" /> ''[[Zebrafish|Danio rerio]]'' (zebra fish) are a species of teleost fish often used for studying serotonin within the brain. Despite much being unknown about serotonergic systems in vertebrates, the importance in moderating stress and social interaction is known.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Winberg S, Thörnqvist PO | title = Role of brain serotonin in modulating fish behavior | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–323 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 29491919 | pmc = 5804243 | doi = 10.1093/cz/zow037 }}</ref> It is hypothesized that AVT and CRF cooperate with serotonin in the [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1005-9_460 hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis].<ref name=":3" /> These [[neuropeptide]]s influence the [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of the teleost, affecting its ability to change and respond to its environment. Subordinate fish in social settings show a drastic increase in 5-HT concentrations.<ref name=":4" /> High levels of 5-HT long term influence the inhibition of aggression in subordinate fish.<ref name=":4" />

===== Mice =====
Researchers at the Department of Pharmacology and Medical Chemistry used serotonergic drugs on male mice to study the effects of selected drugs on their behavior.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Olivier B, Mos J, van der Heyden J, Hartog J | title = Serotonergic modulation of social interactions in isolated male mice | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–156 | date = 1989-02-01 | pmid = 2498921 | doi = 10.1007/BF00442239 | s2cid = 37170174 }}</ref> Mice in isolation exhibit increased levels of [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic behavior]] towards one another. Results found that serotonergic drugs reduce aggression in isolated mice while simultaneously increasing social interaction.<ref name=":5" /> Each of the treatments use a different mechanism for targeting aggression, but ultimately all have the same outcome. While the study shows that serotonergic drugs successfully target serotonin receptors, it does not show specifics of the mechanisms that affect behavior, as all types of drugs tended to reduce aggression in isolated male mice.<ref name=":5" /> Aggressive mice kept out of isolation may respond differently to changes in serotonin reuptake.

==== Behavior ====
Like in humans, serotonin is extremely involved in regulating behavior in most other vertebrates. This includes not only response and social behaviors, but also influencing mood. Defects in serotonin pathways can lead to intense variations in mood, as well as symptoms of mood disorders, which can be present in more than just humans.

===== Social interaction =====
One of the most researched aspects of social interaction in which serotonin is involved is aggression. Aggression is regulated by the 5-HT system, as serotonin levels can both induce or inhibit aggressive behaviors, as seen in mice (see section on Mice) and crabs.<ref name=":5" />  While this is widely accepted, it is unknown if serotonin interacts directly or indirectly with parts of the brain influencing aggression and other behaviors.<ref name=":1" /> Studies of serotonin levels show that they drastically increase and decrease during social interactions, and they generally correlate with inhibiting or inciting aggressive behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huber R, Smith K, Delago A, Isaksson K, Kravitz EA | title = Serotonin and aggressive motivation in crustaceans: altering the decision to retreat | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 11 | pages = 5939–5942 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159179 | pmc = 20885 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.11.5939 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.5939H }}</ref> The exact mechanism of serotonin influencing social behaviors is unknown, as pathways in the 5-HT system in various vertebrates can differ greatly.<ref name=":1" />

===== Response to stimuli =====
Serotonin is important in environmental response pathways, along with other [[neurotransmitter]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanchez CL, Biskup CS, Herpertz S, Gaber TJ, Kuhn CM, Hood SH, Zepf FD | title = The Role of Serotonin (5-HT) in Behavioral Control: Findings from Animal Research and Clinical Implications | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = pyv050 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25991656 | pmc = 4648158 | doi = 10.1093/ijnp/pyv050 }}</ref> Specifically, it has been found to be involved in auditory processing in social settings, as primary sensory systems are connected to social interactions.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen CL, Hurley LM | title = Putting it in Context: Linking Auditory Processing with Social Behavior Circuits in the Vertebrate Brain | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 865–877 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28985384 | pmc = 6251620 | doi = 10.1093/icb/icx055 }}</ref> Serotonin is found in the [[Inferior colliculus|IC structure]] of the midbrain, which processes specie specific and non-specific social interactions and vocalizations.<ref name=":6" /> It also receives acoustic projections that convey signals to auditory processing regions.<ref name=":6" /> Research has proposed that serotonin shapes the auditory information being received by the IC and therefore is influential in the responses to auditory stimuli.<ref name=":6" /> This can influence how an organism responds to the sounds of predatory or other impactful species in their environment, as serotonin uptake can influence aggression and/or social interaction.

===== Mood =====
We can describe mood not as specific to an emotional status, but as associated with a relatively long-lasting emotional state. Serotonin's association with mood is most known for various forms of depression and bipolar disorders in humans.<ref name=":2" /> Disorders caused by serotonergic activity potentially contribute to the many symptoms of major depression, such as overall mood, activity, suicidal thoughts and sexual and [[cognitive dysfunction]]. [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRI's) are a class of drugs demonstrated to be an effective treatment in major depressive disorder and are the most prescribed class of antidepressants. SSRI's function is to block the reuptake of serotonin, making more serotonin available to absorb by the receiving neuron. Animals have been studied for decades in order to understand depressive behavior among species. One of the most familiar studies, the forced swimming test (FST), was performed to measure potential antidepressant activity.<ref name=":2" /> Rats were placed in an inescapable container of water, at which point time spent immobile and number of active behaviors (such as splashing or climbing) were compared before and after a panel of anti-depressant drugs were administered. Antidepressants that selectively inhibit NE reuptake were shown to reduce immobility and selectively increase climbing without affecting swimming. However, results of the SSRI's also show reduced immobility but increased swimming without affecting climbing. This study demonstrated the importance of behavioral tests for antidepressants, as they can detect drugs with an effect on core behavior along with behavioral components of species.<ref name=":2" />

===Growth and reproduction===

Serotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe coprophila]]'' as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. ''Aspergillus niger'' would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the ''Psilocybe coprophila'' as the catalyst for the reaction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alarcón J, Cid E, Lillo L, Céspedesa C, Aguila S, Alderete JB | title = Biotransformation of indole derivatives by mycelial cultures | journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C | volume = 63 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 82–84 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18386493 | doi = 10.1515/znc-2008-1-215 | s2cid = 29472174 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

[[File:Biosynthesis and breakdown of serotonin and the catecholamines, and the metabolic block in AADC deficiency.png|thumb|Process]]

Serotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="pmid18043762" /> However, [[tryptophan]] and its [[metabolite]] [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, do cross the blood–brain barrier. These agents are available as [[dietary supplement]]s and in various foods, and may be effective serotonergic agents.
One product of serotonin breakdown is [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the [[urine]]. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain [[tumor]]s or [[cancer]]s, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors.

Some believed it contained [[adrenaline]], but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown [[amine]], which he named "enteramine".<ref name="Erspamer_1954">{{cite journal | vauthors = Erspamer V | title = Pharmacology of indole-alkylamines | journal = Pharmacol Rev | pages = 425–487 | date = 1954| volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pmid = 13236482 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17526278">{{cite journal | vauthors = Negri L | title = [Vittorio Erspamer (1909–1999)] | journal = Medicina Nei Secoli | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–113 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17526278 | url = https://www.medicinaneisecoli.it/index.php/MedSecoli/article/view/491 }}</ref> In 1948, [[Maurice M. Rapport]], [[Arda Green]], and [[Irvine Page]] of the [[Cleveland Clinic]] discovered a vasoconstrictor substance in [[blood plasma|blood serum]], and since it was a serum agent affecting vascular tone, they named it serotonin.<ref name="pmid18100415">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rapport MM, Green AA, Page IH | title = Serum vasoconstrictor, serotonin; isolation and characterization | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 176 | issue = 3 | pages = 1243–1251 | date = December 1948 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(18)57137-4 | pmid = 18100415 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/176/3/1243.short | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field.<ref name="pmid13035756">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldberg W, Toh CC | title = Distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, enteramine) in the wall of the digestive tract | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 119 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 352–362 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 13035756 | pmc = 1392800 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1953.sp004850 }}</ref> Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, thrombotin, enteramin, substance DS, and 3-(β-Aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole.<ref>SciFinder – Serotonin Substance Detail.
