'''Biological half-life''' ('''elimination half-life''', '''pharmacological half-life''') is the time taken for concentration of a [[drug|biological substance]] (such as a [[medication]]) to decrease from its maximum [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] ([[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]]) to half of C<sub>max</sub> in the [[blood plasma]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologyinonesemester/2-drug-distribution-metabolism-and-elimination/2-5-blood-levels/2-5-2-elimination-half-life |title=Elimination Half-Life |website=Pharmacology in one semester |access-date=20 February 2020 |archive-date=22 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022081736/https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologyinonesemester/2-drug-distribution-metabolism-and-elimination/2-5-blood-levels/2-5-2-elimination-half-life |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="AIDSinfo 2020">{{cite web | title=Definition of Half-Life (t½) | website=AIDSinfo | date=2020-02-19 | url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/glossary/286/half-life | access-date=2020-02-20 | archive-date=20 February 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220040435/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/glossary/286/half-life | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Curry 1993 pp. 127–144">{{cite book | last=Curry | first=Stephen H. | title=Antipsychotic Drugs and their Side-Effects | chapter=PHARMACOKINETICS OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS | publisher=Elsevier | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-12-079035-7 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-079035-7.50015-4 | pages=127–144 | quote=The elimination half-life measures the kinetics of loss of drug from the body as a whole once all distribution equilibria have been achieved.}}</ref><ref name="Dasgupta Krasowski 2020 pp. 1–17">{{cite book | last1=Dasgupta | first1=Amitava | last2=Krasowski | first2=Matthew D. | title=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Data | chapter=Pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring | publisher=Elsevier | year=2020 | isbn=978-0-12-815849-4 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-815849-4.00001-3 | pages=1–17 | s2cid=209258489 | quote=The half-life of a drug is the time required for the serum concentration to be reduced by 50%.

This is used to measure the removal of things such as [[metabolite]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[signalling molecule]]s from the body. Typically, the biological half-life refers to the body's natural [[detoxification]] (cleansing) through [[liver metabolism]] and through the [[excretion]] of the measured substance through the kidneys and intestines. This concept is used when the rate of removal is roughly [[Exponential function|exponential]].<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Biological Half Life|file=B00658}}</ref>

In a medical context, half-life explicitly describes the time it takes for the [[blood plasma]] concentration of a substance to halve (''plasma half-life'') its steady-state when circulating in the full blood of an [[organism]]. This measurement is useful in medicine, [[pharmacology]] and [[pharmacokinetics]] because it helps determine how much of a drug needs to be taken and how frequently it needs to be taken if a certain average amount is needed constantly. By contrast, the stability of a substance in plasma is described as ''plasma stability.'' This is essential to ensure accurate analysis of drugs in plasma and for [[drug discovery]].

The relationship between the biological and plasma half-lives of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues, [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]], active metabolites, and receptor interactions.<ref name="SCM">{{cite book|title=Spinal Cord Medicine|author1=Lin VW|author2=Cardenas DD|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing, LLC|page=251|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3anl3G4No_oC&pg=PA251|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-61-7}}</ref>

==Examples==

===Water===
The biological half-life of water in a human is about 7 to 14 days. It can be altered by behavior. Drinking large amounts of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] will reduce the biological half-life of water in the body.<ref name="isbn0-12-369413-2">{{cite book | author = Nordberg, Gunnar | title = Handbook on the toxicology of metals | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2007 | pages =119 | isbn = 978-0-12-369413-3 }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-521-84228-X">{{cite book |author1=Silk, Kenneth R. |author2=Tyrer, Peter J. | title = Cambridge textbook of effective treatments in psychiatry | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2008 | pages = 295 | isbn = 978-0-521-84228-0 }}</ref> This has been used to decontaminate patients who are internally contaminated with [[tritiated water]]. The basis of this decontamination method is to increase the rate at which the water in the body is replaced with new water.

=== Alcohol ===
The removal of [[ethanol]] (drinking alcohol) through oxidation by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the [[liver]] from the human body is limited. Hence the removal of a large concentration of alcohol from [[blood]] may follow [[Rate equation#Zero order|zero-order kinetics]]. Also the rate-limiting steps for one substance may be in common with other substances. For instance, the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the biochemistry of [[methanol]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. In this way the oxidation of methanol to the [[toxic]] [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] in the human body can be prevented by giving an appropriate amount of [[ethanol]] to a person who has [[eating|ingested]] methanol. Methanol is very toxic and causes [[blindness]] and death. A person who has ingested [[ethylene glycol]] can be treated in the same way. Half life is also relative to the subjective metabolic rate of the individual in question.

=== Metals ===
The biological half-life of [[caesium]] in humans is between one and four months. This can be shortened by feeding the person [[prussian blue]]. The prussian blue in the digestive system acts as a solid [[ion exchange]]r which absorbs the caesium while releasing [[potassium]] ions.

For some substances, it is important to think of the human or animal body as being made up of several parts, each with their own affinity for the substance, and each part with a different biological half-life ([[physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling]]). Attempts to remove a substance from the whole organism may have the effect of increasing the burden present in one part of the organism. For instance, if a person who is contaminated with lead is given [[EDTA]] in a [[chelation therapy]], then while the rate at which lead is lost from the body will be increased, the lead within the body tends to relocate into the [[brain]] where it can do the most harm.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lead toxicity update.

Half-times apply to processes where the elimination rate is exponential. If <math>C(t)</math> is the concentration of a substance at time <math>t</math>, its time dependence is given by

:<math>C(t) = C(0) e^{-kt} \,</math>

where ''k'' is the [[reaction rate constant]]. Such a decay rate arises from a [[Rate equation#First order|first-order reaction]] where the rate of elimination is proportional to the amount of the substance:<ref name=Bonate>{{cite book|last1=Bonate|first1=Peter L.|last2=Howard|first2=Danny R.|title=Clinical study design and analysis|date=2004|publisher=AAPS Press|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=9780971176744|pages=237&ndash;239}}</ref>
:<math>\frac{d C}{d t} = -k C.</math>

The half-life for this process is<ref name=Bonate/>

:<math>t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}. \,</math>

Alternatively, half-life is given by

:<math>t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda _{z}} \,</math>

where ''λ<sub>z</sub>'' is the slope of the terminal phase of the time–concentration curve for the substance on a semilogarithmic scale.<ref name="ToutainBousquet-Melou2004">{{cite journal|last1=Toutain|first1=P. L.|last2=Bousquet-Melou|first2=A.|title=Plasma terminal half-life|journal=Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics|volume=27|issue=6|year=2004|pages=427–439|issn=0140-7783|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2885.2004.00600.x|pmid=15601438}}</ref><ref name="Kwon2007">{{cite book|author=Younggil Kwon|title=Handbook of Essential Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism for Industrial Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt7pBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=8 May 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46820-9|pages=24–}}</ref>

Half-life is determined by [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] (CL) and [[volume of distribution]] (V<sub>D</sub>) and the relationship is described by the following equation:

:<math>t_\frac{1}{2} = \frac{{\ln 2}\cdot{V_D}}{CL} \,</math>

In clinical practice, this means that it takes 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug's serum concentration to reach steady state after regular dosing is started, stopped, or the dose changed.  So, for example, digoxin has a half-life (or t<sub>½</sub>) of 24–36 h; this means that a change in the dose will take the best part of a week to take full effect. For this reason, drugs with a long half-life (e.g., [[amiodarone]], elimination t<sub>½</sub> of about 58 days) are usually started with a [[loading dose]] to achieve their desired clinical effect more quickly.

===Biphasic half-life===
Many drugs follow a biphasic elimination curve — first a steep slope then a shallow slope:
:STEEP (initial) part of curve —> initial distribution of the drug in the body.
:SHALLOW part of curve —> ultimate excretion of drug, which is dependent on the release of the drug from tissue compartments into the blood. 
The longer half-life is called the ''terminal half-life'' and the half-life of the largest component is called the ''dominant half-life.''<ref name=Bonate/> For a more detailed description see [[Pharmacokinetics#Multi-compartmental models|Pharmacokinetics § Multi-compartmental models]].
