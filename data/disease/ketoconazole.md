Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral [[5α-reductase inhibitor]] such as [[finasteride]] or [[dutasteride]] has been used off label to treat [[androgenic alopecia]].

====Hormonal====
{{See also|Steroidogenesis inhibitor|CYP17A1 inhibitor}}

The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol [[ergosterol]] in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800&nbsp;mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several [[enzyme]]s necessary for the conversion of [[cholesterol]] to [[steroid hormone]]s such as [[testosterone]] and [[cortisol]].<ref name=finkel/><ref name="Becker2001" /> Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit [[cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]], which converts cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]], [[17α-hydroxylase]] and [[17,20-lyase]],<ref name="Becker2001" /> which convert [[pregnenolone]] into [[androgen]]s, and [[11β-hydroxylase]], which converts [[11-deoxycortisol]] to [[cortisol]].<ref name=Medscape-keto>{{cite web|title=MedScape|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/582330_3|website=Ectopic Cortisol Production Derived From Malignant Testicular Masses: Treatment and Management|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|access-date=18 April 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513210423/https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/582330_3|archive-date=13 May 2018}}</ref> All of these enzymes are mitochondrial [[cytochrome p450]] enzymes.<ref name="pmid6304148">{{cite journal | vauthors = Loose DS, Kan PB, Hirst MA, Marcus RA, Feldman D | title = Ketoconazole blocks adrenal steroidogenesis by inhibiting cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 1495–9 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6304148 | pmc = 437014 | doi = 10.1172/JCI110903 }}</ref> Based on these [[antiandrogen]] and [[antiglucocorticoid]] effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced [[prostate cancer]]<ref name="Becker2001" /><ref name=zelefsky>{{cite book |vauthors=Zelefsky MJ, Eastham JA, Sartor OA, Kantoff P | title=Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology | year=2008 | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location=Philadelphia | isbn=9780781772075 | page=1443 | edition=8th |veditors=DeVita VT, Lawrence TS, Rosenberg SA }}</ref> and for the suppression of [[glucocorticoid]] synthesis in the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]].<ref name=Cushing>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loli P, Berselli ME, Tagliaferri M | title = Use of ketoconazole in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 1365–71 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 3023421 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-6-1365 }}</ref> However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent [[adrenal insufficiency]].<ref name="Becker2001" /> Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat [[hirsutism]] and, in combination with a [[GnRH analogue]], [[male-limited precocious puberty]].<ref name="Becker2001" /> In any case, the risk of [[hepatotoxicity]] with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.<ref name="Becker2001" />

==Contraindications==
Oral ketoconazole has various [[contraindication]]s, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known [[drug interaction]]s.<ref name="Ketoconazole tablet label" /> Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include [[liver disease]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], and known [[hypersensitivity]] to oral ketoconazole.<ref name="Ketoconazole tablet label" />

==Side effects==

===Gastrointestinal===
Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, [[dysgeusia]], [[dyspepsia]], [[flatulence]], tongue discoloration may occur.<ref name=":1" />

===Endocrine===
The drug may cause [[adrenal insufficiency]] so the level of the [[adrenocortical hormone]]s should be monitored while taking it.<ref name=FDA2013/><ref name=":1" /> Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000&nbsp;mg/day has been found to result in a rate of [[gynecomastia]] of 21%.<ref name="DeepinderBraunstein2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deepinder F, Braunstein GD | title = Drug-induced gynecomastia: an evidence-based review | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Safety | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 779–95 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22862307 | doi = 10.1517/14740338.2012.712109 | s2cid = 22938364 }}</ref>

===Liver===
In July 2013, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: [[adrenal insufficiency]] and worsening of other related to the gland conditions.<ref name=FDA2013/> It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated.<ref name=FDA2013/> As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease.<ref name=FDA2013/>

===Hypersensitivity===
[[Anaphylaxis]] after the first dose may occur.{{medcn|date=February 2024}} Other cases of hypersensitivity include [[Hives|urticaria]].<ref name="AHFS2019" /><ref name="Ketoconazole tablet label" />

===Topical formulations===

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Antifungal activity====
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2013}}

As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to [[imidazole]], and interferes with the fungal synthesis of [[ergosterol]], a constituent of fungal [[cell membrane]]s, as well as certain [[enzyme]]s. As with all [[azole antifungal]] agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[14α-demethylase]] (CYP51A1).<ref name="pmid6304148"/> This enzyme participates in the [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway that leads from [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]]. Lower doses of [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for fungal cell membranes.

Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including ''Candida albicans''. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. [[Multidrug resistance|Multidrug-resistance]] (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartledge JD, Midgley J, Gazzard BG | title = Clinically significant azole cross-resistance in Candida isolates from HIV-positive patients with oral candidosis | journal = AIDS | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 1839–44 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9412702 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199715000-00008 | s2cid = 8440973 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanglard D, Ischer F, Monod M, Bille J | title = Cloning of Candida albicans genes conferring resistance to azole antifungal agents: characterization of CDR2, a new multidrug ABC transporter gene | journal = Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 405–16 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043118 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-143-2-405 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Antihormonal activity====
As an [[antiandrogen]], ketoconazole operates through at least two [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]] of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40&nbsp;mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels.<ref name="Becker2001" /><ref name="pmid2652864">{{cite journal | vauthors = Witjes FJ, Debruyne FM, Fernandez del Moral P, Geboers AD | title = Ketoconazole high dose in management of hormonally pretreated patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer.

===Pharmacokinetics===
