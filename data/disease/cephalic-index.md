[[File:Cephalic index.svg|thumb|Cephalic index viewed from above the head]]
The '''cephalic index''' or '''cranial index''' is a number obtained by taking the maximum width ([[biparietal diameter]] or BPD, side to side) of the head of an [[organism]], multiplying it by 100 and then dividing it by their maximum length ([[occipitofrontal diameter]] or OFD, front to back). The index was once used to categorize human beings in the first half of the 20th century, but today it is used to categorize dogs and cats.

==Historic use in anthropology==
===Early anthropology===
[[File:Cephalic index map of Europe by Bertil Lundman, 1993.jpg|thumb|Cephalic index map of Europe by Bertil Lundman]]
The cephalic index was used by anthropologists in the early 20th century as a tool to categorize human populations. It was used to describe an individual's appearance and for estimating the age of [[fetus]]es for legal and obstetrical reasons.

The cephalic index was defined by [[Sweden|Swedish]] professor of [[anatomy]] [[Anders Retzius]] (1796–1860) and first used in [[physical anthropology]] to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. The theory became closely associated with the development of [[racial anthropology]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when historians attempted to use ancient remains to model population movements in terms of racial categories. American anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]] also used the index in the 1960s, by which time it had been largely discredited.

[[File:PSM V59 D404 Cephalic indexes of skull shapes.png|thumb|Cephalic indexes of skull shapes. Long skull (left) – cephalic index 71.4; tall skull (center) – cephalic index 81; broad skull (right) – cephalic index 85]]

In the cephalic index model, human beings were characterized by having either a dolichocephalic (long-headed), mesaticephalic (moderate-headed), or brachycephalic (short-headed) cephalic index or cranial index.
[[File:Otmaa1917 1-1-.jpg|thumb|The children of the Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] in June 1917, with loss of hair after fighting [[measles]]: among them, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|Tatiana]] had the skull with least cephalic index.]]

===Indices===
[[File:PSM V50 D602 World cephalic index map.jpg|thumb|1896 world cephalic index map]]
Cephalic indices are grouped as in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Females !! Males !! Scientific term !! Meaning !! Alternative term
|-
| < 75 || < 75.9  || ''dolichocephalic'' || 'long-headed' ||
|-
| 75 to 83 || 76 to 81 || ''mesaticephalic'' || 'medium-headed' || ''mesocephalic''; ''mesocranial''
|-
| > 83 || > 81.1 || ''brachycephalic'' || 'short-headed' || ''brachycranial''
|}

Technically, the measured factors are defined as the maximum width of the bones that surround the head above the [[Temporal bone|supramastoid crest]] (behind the cheekbones), and the maximum length from the most easily noticed part of the [[Frontal bone|glabella]] (between the eyebrows) to the most easily noticed point on the back part of the head.

===Controversy===

The usefulness of the cephalic index was questioned by [[Giuseppe Sergi]], who argued that cranial morphology provided a better means to model racial ancestry.<ref>{{cite thesis| vauthors = Killgrove K |year=2005 |title=Bioarchaeology in the Roman World | degree = Masters | publisher = UNC Chapel Hill |url=http://www.piki.org/~kristina/Killgrove-2005-classics.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328162246/http://www.piki.org/~kristina/Killgrove-2005-classics.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Also, [[Franz Boas]] studied the children of immigrants to the United States in 1910 to 1912, noting that the children's cephalic index differed significantly from their parents', implying that local environmental conditions had a significant effect on the development of head shape.<ref name="Holloway_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holloway RL | title = Head to head with Boas: did he err on the plasticity of head form? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 23 | pages = 14622–3 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12419854 | pmc = 137467 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.242622399 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9914622H | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Boas argued that if craniofacial features were so malleable in a single generation, then the cephalic index was of little use for defining race and mapping ancestral populations. Scholars such as [[Earnest Hooton]] continued to argue that both environment and heredity were involved. Boas did not himself claim it was totally plastic.

In 2002, a paper by Sparks and Jantz re-evaluated some of Boas's original data using new statistical techniques and concluded that there was a "relatively high genetic component" of head shape.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sparks CS, Jantz RL | title = A reassessment of human cranial plasticity: Boas revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 23 | pages = 14636–14639 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12374854 | pmc = 137471 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.222389599 | doi-access = free | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9914636S }}.

In 2003, anthropologists Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard reanalyzed Boas's data and concluded that most of Boas's original findings were correct. Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas's data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity.<ref name=Gravlee>{{cite journal| vauthors = Gravlee CC, Bernard HR, Leonard WR |title=Heredity, environment, and cranial form: A reanalysis of Boas's immigrant data|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2003|volume=105|issue=1|pages=125–138|doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.1.125|url=http://www.gravlee.org/files/pdfs/gravlee03a.pdf|access-date=2018-03-23|hdl=2027.42/65137|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730140427/http://www.gravlee.org/files/pdfs/gravlee03a.pdf|archive-date=30 July 2014|url-status=dead|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks's and Jantz's analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims, and that Sparks's and Jantz's data support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful, because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.<ref name=Gravlee/>

Jantz and Sparks responded to Gravlee et al., reiterating that Boas' findings lacked biological meaning, and that the interpretation of Boas' results common in the literature was biologically inaccurate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sparks CS, Jantz RL  |title=Changing Times, Changing Faces: Franz Boas's Immigrant Study in Modern Perspective |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=105 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=333–337 |doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.2.333 }}</ref> In a later study, the same authors concluded that the effects Boas observed were likely the result of population-specific environmental effects such as changes in cultural practices for cradling infants, rather than the effects of a general "American environment" which caused populations in America to converge to a common cranial type, as Boas had suggested.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jantz RL, Logan MH | title = Why does head form change in children of immigrants?

A brachycephalic skull is relatively broad and short (typically with the breadth at least 80% of the length). Dog breeds such as the [[pug]] are sometimes classified as "extreme brachycephalic".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/health/for-owners/brachycephalic-health/|title=Brachycephalic Health|website=www.thekennelclub.org.uk|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> Because of the health issues brachycephaly is regarded as torture breeding<ref>FOUR PAWS International: ''[https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/companion-animals/breeding-of-dogs-with-genetic-disorders/the-suffering-of-dogs-with-genetic-disorders The suffering of dogs with genetic disorders]''</ref><ref>Anne Fawcett, [[Vanessa Barrs]], Magdoline Awad et al.: ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356869/ Consequences and Management of Canine Brachycephaly in Veterinary Practice: Perspectives from Australian Veterinarians and Veterinary Specialists]''</ref><ref>Border Wars: ''[http://www.border-wars.com/2011/07/torture-breeding.html Torture breeding]''</ref><ref>FECAVA: ''[https://www.fecava.org/policies-actions/healthy-breeding-3/ Brachycephalic issues: shared resources]''</ref> as it often leads to the [[brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome]].

===Mesaticephalic animals===
[[Image:Labrador Retriever black portrait Ellis.jpg|thumb|Mesocephalic [[Labrador Retriever]]]]

A mesaticephalic skull is of intermediate length and width. Mesaticephalic skulls are not markedly brachycephalic or dolichocephalic. When dealing with animals, especially dogs, the more appropriate and commonly used term is not "mesocephalic", but rather "mesaticephalic", which is a ratio of head to nasal cavity.  The breeds below exemplify this category.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Evans HE |year=1994 |title=Miller's Anatomy of the Dog |edition=3rd |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Saunders |isbn=9780721632001 |page=132 |oclc=827702042}}<!-- I've expanded the reference based on the available information; I hope the results are correct.
