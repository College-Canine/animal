'''''Ancylostoma caninum''''' is a species of [[nematode]] known as a [[hookworm]], which principally infects the [[small intestine]] of [[dog]]s.<ref name=ADW>{{cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ancylostoma_caninum/|title= ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |last1= Saeed |first1= Sophia  |year= 2003  |publisher= Animal Diversity Web |access-date= March 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Marquardt2000">{{cite book | author=Marquardt W | author2=Demaree | author3=Grieve |year=2000|edition=2nd | title=Parasitology and Vector Biology | publisher=Harcourt Academic | pages=370–376 |isbn=978-0121707552}}</ref><ref name="Olsen1986">{{cite book |author=Olsen W |year=1986 |title=Animal Parasites: their lifecycles and ecology |edition=3rd |publisher=Dover |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animalparasitest0000olse/page/399 399–416] |isbn=978-0486651262 |url=https://archive.org/details/animalparasitest0000olse/page/399 }}</ref>  The result of ''A. caninum'' infection ranges from [[asymptomatic]] cases to death of the dog; better nourishment, increasing age, prior ''A. caninum'' exposure, or [[vaccination]] are all linked to improved survival.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name="Miller1965">{{cite journal | author=Miller | title=Influence of Age and Sex on Susceptibility of Dogs to Primary Infection with ''Ancylostoma caninum'' | journal=The Journal of Parasitology | volume=51 |issue=5| pages=701–704 | year=1965 | pmid=5857264 | doi=10.2307/3276142| jstor=3276142 }}</ref><ref name=MVM>{{cite web |url= http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23507.htm |title= Hookworms in Small Animals |last1= Peregrine |first1= Andrew |date= March 2012 |publisher= The Merck Veterinary Manual |access-date= March 20, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120711145125/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm%2Fbc%2F23507.htm |archive-date= 2012-07-11 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref name=Ghosh1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghosh K, Hotez, P |title=Antibody-Dependent Reductions in Mouse Hookworm Burden after Vaccination with ''Ancylostoma caninum'' Secreted Protein 1 |journal=J Infect Dis  |volume=180 |issue=5 |pages=1674–1681 |date=January 1999 |doi=10.1086/315059 |pmid=10515831 |doi-access= |s2cid=17298045 }}</ref>  Other [[Host (biology)|hosts]] include [[carnivore]]s such as [[wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[cat]]s, with a small number of cases having been reported in humans.<ref name=ADW/><ref name="Marquardt2000"/>

==Morphology==
[[File:Anterior end of A. caninum.jpg|thumb|Mouth and teeth of ''A. caninum'']]
[[File:Canine hookworm egg 1.JPG|thumb|''A. caninum'' egg]]
''A. caninum'' females are typically {{convert|14|-|16|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide, while the males are smaller at {{convert|10|-|12|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|0.36|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in width.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name="Olsen1986" />  Males have a [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/copulatory+bursa copulatory bursa] , which consists of spine-like [[spicule (nematode)|spicule]]s positioned on three muscular rays that grasp the female during mating.<ref name=ADW /><ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name="Olsen1986" />  As with other nematodes, the sperm lack [[flagella]].<ref name=ADW />  The copulatory bursa is a unique feature of [[Strongylida]] members, thus making it a useful means for identifying members of this [[suborder]]; it is also used to distinguish members within the suborder due to differences in bursa appearance between [[species]].<ref name="Marquardt2000"/> The [[vulva]] of ''A. caninum'' females is located at the boundary of the second and final thirds of the body.<ref name=ADW/>

The teeth of ''A. caninum'' are found in the buccal capsule and divided into three sets.<ref name=ADW/><ref name="Marquardt2000"/>  Two [[ventral]] sets form a lower-jaw equivalent, while a further set projects from the [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] side and loosely equates to an upper jaw.<ref name="Marquardt2000"/>  Each ventral set has three points, with those furthest to the sides being the largest.<ref name=ADW/><ref name="Ruppert1994">{{cite book|author=Ruppert E|year=1994|title=Invertebrate Zoology|edition=6th|publisher=Saunders College Pub|pages=[https://archive.org/details/invertebratezool0006rupp/page/293 293]|isbn=978-0030989803|url=https://archive.org/details/invertebratezool0006rupp/page/293}}</ref>  While the ventral sets are prominent, the dorsal set is hidden deeper in the buccal capsule.<ref name=ADW/>

''A. caninum'' bends its head end upward (dorsally), which has been noted to be a potential source of confusion when determining how the hookworm is oriented.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  If it has recently ingested blood, ''A. caninum'' is red in colour; if not, it appears grey.<ref name=ADW/>  ''A. caninum'' has an [[Gut (anatomy)|alimentary canal]] made up of an [[esophagus]], [[intestine]], and [[rectum]] – the esophagus is highly muscular, reflecting its role in pulling [[intestinal mucosa]] into the body when it feeds.<ref name=Marquardt2000/><ref name=Olsen1986/>  Esophageal and anal rings of ''A. caninum'' are the source of [[nerve fibres]] that extend throughout the body to innervate sensory organs, including [[amphids]] and [[Phasmid (nematode)|phasmids]].<ref name=ADW/><ref name=Olsen1986/>

[[Nematode#Reproduction|Eggs]] are laid by the females, typically when at the [[eight-cell stage]].<ref name="Olsen1986" />  Eggs are 38–43&nbsp;μm in width, with thin walls.<ref name=Olsen1986/><ref name=MVM/>

==Distribution==
Freezing, temperatures exceeding {{convert|abbr=on|37|°C|F|0}}, drying, or exposing ''A. caninum'' to sunlight all give reduced survival of the free-living stage, with rates of infection rising with temperature, provided 37&nbsp;°C is not exceeded.<ref name=ADW /><ref name="Marquardt2000" />  ''A. caninum'' is, therefore, largely restricted to warm, moist climates, though infections are seen in the United States and southern Canada where the temperature is suboptimal.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  Specific niches are also able to satisfy the environmental requirements of ''A. caninum'', despite not necessarily being in the [[tropics]], such as [[Mining|mines]].<ref name="Marquardt2000" />

==Lifecycle==

===Transmission via the environment===
Eggs are excreted from the host in the [[feces]] and typically hatch within a day on moist, warm soil into [[larvae]] with a non-living [[Cuticle|cuticle layer]].<ref name=ADW /><ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  By 4–5 days, the larvae have [[moulted]] twice and are now able to infect a host.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  Migration occurs from the feces into the surrounding [[soil]].<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  Two routes of infection from the environment exist.  The first route involves penetration of [[skin]] at [[hair follicles]] or [[sweat glands]], especially between the [[Paws|footpads]] where contact with soil is frequent and the skin is thinner than otherwise.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  Secretion of a [[protease]] by ''A. caninum'' is thought to aid this process.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  The larvae then migrate through the [[dermis]] of the skin, enter the [[circulatory system]] and are carried to the [[lungs]].<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  ''A. caninum'' larvae exit the blood at the lungs, move from the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] up through the [[Invertebrate trachea|trachea]] and are swallowed to end up in the intestine.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />

The second and more common route to the small intestine is by direct [[ingestion]] of ''A. caninum'' by the host, but the subsequent process is identical in either case.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name="Olsen1986" />  During this third stage of the larva, male or female reproductive organs become established.<ref name="Olsen1986" />  Larvae of this stage have been shown to secrete a molecule (Ac-asp-2) related to [[venom]] [[allergens]] in response to host-specific signals; this is thought to have a possible role in helping with the infection process.<ref name=Hawdon1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawdon J, Narasimhan S, Hotez P |title=''Ancylostoma'' secreted protein 2: cloning and characterization of a second member of a family of nematode secreted proteins from ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |journal= Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology  |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=149–165 |date=April 1999 |doi=10.1016/S0166-6851(99)00011-0 |pmid=10340481|doi-access=free }}</ref>  A third and final moulting occurs, resulting in the mature form of ''A. caninum,'' which then feeds on mucosa and [[blood]] of the small intestinal wall.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  The trigger of feeding is understood to be a receptor-mediated response; however, the detail of this process has yet to be established.<ref name=Hawdon1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawdon J, Schad G |title=Serum-Stimulated Feeding In vitro by Third-Stage Infective Larvae of the Canine Hookworm ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |journal= The Journal of Parasitology |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=394–398 |date=February 1990 |pmid=2112598|doi=10.2307/3282673|jstor=3282673 }}</ref>  Sexual reproduction also occurs in the intestine to produce a further round of eggs to complete the cycle.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />   Females are thought to produce a pheromone which attracts males and are able to lay about 10,000 eggs per day.<ref name=ADW /><ref name=Herrick1928>{{cite journal |author=Herrick C |title=A Quantitative Study of Infections with ''Ancylostoma caninum'' in Dogs |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=125–157 |date=September 1928 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a120994 }}</ref>

===Direct transmission===
Direct transmission between hosts is also possible.  Larvae having accessed through the skin may avoid exit via the lungs and remain in circulation for transport around the body.<ref name="Olsen1986" />  At the [[uterine artery]] of a pregnant female, the larvae are able to cross the [[placenta]] to cause prenatal infection of [[foetuses]].<ref name="Olsen1986" />  Larvae of an infected foetus move to the [[liver]] until birth, when migration continues with movement to the intestine via the circulation and lungs as previously described.<ref name="Olsen1986" />  Alternatively, ''A. caninum'' larvae evading exit from the circulation at the lungs may instead be carried to the [[mammary glands]] and transmitted from the mother in her [[colostrum]] or [[milk]] to her pups; infection then proceeds in an identical manner as infection by ingestion from the environment.<ref name="Olsen1986" /><ref name=MVM />  Infected mothers have been found to only rarely give prenatal transmission to pups, while the likelihood of causing transmission via the lactational route during nursing is much higher.<ref name=Burke1985>{{cite journal |vauthors=Burke T, Roberson E |title=Prenatal and lactational transmission of Toxocara canis and ''Ancylostoma caninum'': Experimental infection of the female before pregnancy |journal= International Journal for Parasitology  |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=71–75 |date=February 1985 |doi=10.1016/0020-7519(85)90104-3 |pmid=3980144 }}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==

===Damage during migration to intestine===
[[File:Hookworms.JPG|thumb|Pair of ''A. caninum'' hookworms.]]
''A. caninum'' larvae cause damage to the host at the point of entry through the skin, leaving a wound vulnerable to [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002300.htm secondary infections].<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  As the larvae migrate through the skin, an [[inflammatory response]], [[dermatitis]], is often stimulated, which can be exacerbated in hosts which have [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitive responses]].<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  Further damage is caused when the larvae leave the circulation and enter the lung, with the amount of damage dependent on the extent of the infection; [[pneumonia]] and [[coughing]] are common consequences.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />

===Damage once in intestine===
Once in the gut, ''A. caninum'' attaches to and ingests the mucosal lining along with some consumption of blood; up to 0.1 ml in 24hrs.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  In a 24hr period ''A. caninum'' typically feeds from six sites.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  This damage to the mucosa compromises the body's defences and can result in secondary infections by [[microbes]].<ref name="Cheng1986" />  A group of [[anticoagulant]] proteins called ''A. caninum'' anticoagulant proteins (AcAPs), which inhibit a range of blood [[Blood coagulation factors#Coagulation factors|coagulation factors]] such as [[Factor X|Xa]], are used by ''A. caninum'' to help in the feeding process by preventing clotting and increasing blood loss.<ref name=Stanssens1996>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stanssens P, Bergum P, Gansemans Y |title=Anticoagulant repertoire of the hookworm ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |journal= PNAS |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=2149–2154 |date=March 1996 |pmc=39925 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.93.5.2149 |pmid=8700900|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.2149S |display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=Cappello1995>
{{cite journal |vauthors=Cappello M, Vlasuk G, Bergum P |title=''Ancylostoma caninum'' anticoagulant peptide: a hookworm-derived inhibitor of human coagulation factor Xa |journal= PNAS |volume=92 |issue=13 |pages=6152–6156 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7597095 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.92.13.6152|display-authors=etal |pmc=41660|bibcode=1995PNAS...92.6152C |doi-access=free }}</ref>  These AcAPs are among the most powerful natural anticoagulants that exist and are a key reason for [[anemia]] being caused and blood being observed in the faeces of infected hosts.<ref name=MVM /><ref name=Cappello1995 />  Blood losses peak just prior to egg production by the females because this is when their requirements for food are greatest; the amount that they are eating is also peaking, so maximal damage to the intestine is being caused.<ref name="Olsen1986" />

==Diagnosis==
Analysis of faeces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet-informed-veterinary-advice-online.com/fecal-flotation.html|title=Veterinary Advice Online – Fecal Flotation|work=Pet-Informed}}</ref> is the definitive method by which a suspected ''A. caninum'' infection is confirmed.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />  The faeces are sampled and examined microscopically for the characteristic ovular, thin-shelled eggs of ''A. caninum''.<ref name=MVM />  Absence of eggs in faeces does not rule out infection; a significant delay of at least 5 weeks exists between initial infection and excretion of eggs in the faeces (larvae must fully mature and reproduce before eggs can be laid).<ref name="Olsen1986" /><ref name=MVM />  In fact, pups frequently die before passing of eggs in the faeces begins.<ref name=MVM />  Using the number of eggs in stool samples as an indicator of the extent of infestation requires care to be taken because females have been shown to produce fewer eggs when the overall number of worms increases.<ref name=Sarles1929>{{cite journal |author=Sarles M |title=The Effect of Age and Size of Infestation on the Egg Production of the Dog Hookworm ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |journal=  The American Journal of Hygiene  |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=658–666 |date=November 1929 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/658.full.pdf}}{{dead link|date=May 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Signs and [[symptoms]] expected to be observed are [[lethargy]], weight loss, weakness, roughness of the hair coat, and pale [[mucous membranes]] indicative of anemia.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  Well-fed, older dogs with smaller infestations may present few or even none of these symptoms.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  [[Diarrhoea]] is rare, but stools are typically black due to the blood-derived [[haemoglobin]] present in them.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />

The disease resulting from such ''A. caninum'' infection is referred to by the general term "hookworm disease" or the more specific terms "[[ancylostomiasis]]" and "ancylostomosis,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ancylostomosis|title=Ancyclostomosis|work=Medical Dictionary}}</ref>  which recognise the [[genus]] of the causative nematode.<ref name="Marquardt2000" />

==Prevention and control==
[[File:Dog kennel Mason.jpg|thumb|Dog kennel: keeping kennels clean reduces risk of ''A. caninum'' infection.]]
A clean environment minimises the risk of ''A. caninum'' infection; this can include regularly washed [[concrete]] or [[gravel]] in [[kennels]] instead of soil.<ref name="Marquardt2000" /><ref name=MVM />  Females are typically checked prior to using them for [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] purposes for nematodes such as ''A. caninum'' and [[birth]] and [[suckling]] can be restricted to sanitised areas to lower the risk of health complications to the pups.<ref name=MVM />  When infection of a pregnant dog is known or suspected [[fenbendazole]] or [[ivermectin]] can be administered to the female to help avoid transmission to the pups.<ref name=MVM />

Canines have been seen to develop significant resistance to ''A. caninum'' naturally with age; this protection develops faster in and fully mature females show substantially greater resistance than fully mature dogs.<ref name="Miller1965" />  Specifically the age-related resistance means ''A. caninum'' takes longer to reach [[sexual maturity]] in older animals and fewer larvae fully develop.<ref name=Herrick1928 />

==Vaccination==
Numerous [[vaccine]]s have been developed with varying success against ''A. caninum''.  Use of an enzyme important in the worm's feeding process is popular, with one example being AcCP2, a protease, which, when used to vaccinate dogs, gives a strong [[Humoral immunity|antibody response]], a lowering of numbers of eggs found in stools and a decrease in intestinal worm size.<ref name=Loukas2004>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loukas A, Bethony JM, Williamson AL |title=Vaccination of dogs with a recombinant cysteine protease from the intestine of canine hookworms diminishes the fecundity and growth of worms |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=189 |issue=10 |pages=1952–61 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15122534 |doi=10.1086/386346 |display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}</ref>  These effects are attributed to reduced AcCP2 activity upon [[antibody]] binding.<ref name=Loukas2004 />  A similar approach has been taken using another ''A. caninum'' digestive enzyme, AcGST1, but it failed to give statistically significant results in dogs.<ref name="Zhan2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhan B, Liu S, Perally S |title=Biochemical characterization and vaccine potential of a heme-binding glutathione transferase from the adult hookworm ''Ancylostoma caninum'' |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=73 |issue=10 |pages=6903–11 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16177370 |pmc=1230892 |doi=10.1128/IAI.73.10.6903-6911.2005 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

An alternative approach has been to disrupt the migratory ability of ''A. caninum;'' this was done successfully using the AcASP1 protein of ''A. caninum,'' which gives an increase in antibody levels of all subclasses, as well as a reduced worm burden.<ref name=Ghosh1999 />  Other studies using the same vaccine have shown 79% reduction of worm burden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Worm+Burden|title=Worm Burden|work=Medical Dictionary}}</ref> resulting from this approach.<ref name=Ghosh1996>
{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghosh K, Hawdon J, Hotez, P |title=Vaccination with Alum-Precipitated Recombinant Ancylostoma-Secreted Protein 1 Protects Mice against Challenge Infections with Infective Hookworm (''Ancylostoma caninum'') Larvae |journal=J Infect Dis  |volume=174 |issue=6 |pages=1380–1383 |date=May 1996 |doi=10.1093/infdis/174.6.1380 |pmid=8940240 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Animals with prior exposure to ''A. caninum'' show enhanced resistance, but careful removal of all worms from the previous infection results in loss of this resistance.<ref name=Herrick1928 />  Studies in mice show resistance due to past exposure can protect against otherwise lethal worm doses and that this is a general form of resistance – defense is offered against subsequent infections via either mouth ''or'' skin.<ref name=Kerr1936>

==Medication==
Drugs used in treatment of ''A. caninum'' infections of dogs include: [[dichlorvos]], [[fenbendazole]], [[flubendazole]], [[mebendazole]], [[nitroscanate]], [[piperazine]], [[pyrantel]], [[milbemycin]], [[moxidectin]], [[diethylcarbamazine]], [[oxibendazole]],  and [[ivermectin]].<ref name=MVM />

==In humans==
In inappropriate hosts such as humans, ''A. caninum'' is able to enter the skin, but cannot proceed into the circulation and on to the intestine; instead, the disease [[cutaneous larva migrans|dermal larva migrans]] results, caused by movement of the nematode within the skin and which can persist for several months without intervention.<ref name=ADW />

While access to the intestine is not possible via this route, it can occur via ingestion; in a report of 93 [[Enterocolitis|enteritis]] cases in northern [[Queensland|Queensland, Australia]], which were possibly caused by'' A. caninum ''infection, all those interviewed described behaviour consistent with ''A. caninum'' exposure and a [[colonoscopy]] of one patient gave positive identification of an adult ''A. caninum'' worm.<ref name=Prociv1990>

==Economic burden==
The animals affected by ''A. caninum'' infection are not used for [[food]] or labour purposes, thus the economic burden from [[animal]] illness is low.<ref name=ADW />  Human ''A. caninum'' infections are likely underestimated and misdiagnosed; the economic impact caused by missing work due to infection <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/dayslost.htm|title=Measures of working days lost: Definitions and formulae|work=Health and Safety Executive (HSE)}}</ref> may be underestimated and significant.<ref name=Walker1995 />
