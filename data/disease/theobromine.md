===Biosynthesis===
Theobromine is a purine alkaloid derived from [[xanthosine]], a [[nucleoside]].  Cleavage of the ribose and N-methylation yields 7-methylxanthosine.  7-Methylxanthosine in turn is the precursor to theobromine, which in turn is the precursor to [[caffeine]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ashihara H, Yokota T, Crozier A | title = New Light on Alkaloid Biosynthesis and Future Prospects | year = 2013 | chapter = Biosynthesis and catabolism of purine alkaloids | journal = Advances in Botanical Research | volume = 68 | pages = 111–138 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-408061-4.00004-3 |isbn=9780124080614 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Caffeine metabolites.svg|thumb|250px|Caffeine is metabolized in the liver into three primary metabolites:

Even without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the body as it is a product of the human metabolism of [[caffeine]], which is [[metabolism|metabolised]] in the liver into 12% theobromine, 4% [[theophylline]], and 84% [[paraxanthine]].<ref name="pharmgkb">{{cite web | title = Caffeine | publisher = The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base | url = http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA448710&objCls=Drug#tabview=tab1 | access-date = 2011-01-08 | archive-date = 2010-11-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101124155701/http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA448710&objCls=Drug#tabview=tab1 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Unlike caffeine, which is highly water-soluble, theobromine is only slightly water-soluble and is more fat soluble, and thus peaks more slowly in the blood. While caffeine peaks after only 30 minutes, theobromine requires 2–3 hours to peak.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mumford GK, Benowitz NL, Evans SM, Kaminski BJ, Preston KL, Sannerud CA, Silverman K, Griffiths RR | title = Absorption rate of methylxanthines following capsules, cola and chocolate | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 51 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 319–325 | date = 1 December 1996 | pmid = 9010706 | doi = 10.1007/s002280050205 | s2cid = 8405909 }}</ref>

==Effects==
{{see also|Theobromine poisoning}}

===Humans===
Theobromine has no significant stimulant effect on the human central nervous system.<ref name=pubchem/> It is a [[bronchodilator]] and causes relaxation of [[vascular smooth muscle]].<ref name=pubchem/> It is not currently used as a [[prescription drug]].<ref name=Hbk/> The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can, in general, be safely consumed by humans.

Compared with caffeine, theobromine is weaker in both its inhibition of [[cyclic nucleotide]] [[phosphodiesterases]] and its [[Receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of [[adenosine receptors]].<ref name=pubchem/><ref name="therapeutics">{{cite book | veditors = Hardman J, Limbird L | title=Goodman & Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics, 10th ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | year=2001 | page=745 | isbn=978-0-07-135469-1}}</ref> The potential [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]]y effect of theobromine is seen only at amounts much higher than what people normally would consume in a typical diet including chocolate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01412|title=Theobromine|publisher=DrugBank.ca|access-date=3 November 2018|archive-date=13 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113075732/https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01412|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At doses of 0.8–1.5 g/day (50–100 g cocoa), sweating, trembling and severe headaches were noted, with limited mood effects found at 250&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb%3A%40term+%40DOCNO+7332#permalink|title=3,7-Dimethylxanthine (Theobromine)|publisher=Toxnet, US National Library of Medicine|date=1 December 2017|access-date=13 November 2018|archive-date=7 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007145619/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+7332#permalink|url-status=live}}</ref>

Also, chocolate may be a factor for [[heartburn]] in some people because theobromine may affect the [[Lower esophageal sphincter|esophageal sphincter]] muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the [[esophagus]].<ref name="Latif">{{cite journal | vauthors = Latif R | title = Chocolate/cocoa and human health: a review | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–68 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23462053 | url = http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=1269 }}</ref>

The concentration of theobromine in dark chocolates (about {{cvt|10|g/kg}}) is up to 10 times that of milk chocolate ({{cvt|1|to|5|g/kg}}), meaning dark chocolate is far more toxic to dogs per unit weight or volume than milk chocolate.{{Cn|date=May 2024}}

The [[median lethal dose]] of theobromine for dogs is {{cvt|100|–|200|mg/kg|}}; therefore, a {{cvt|10|kg|}} dog would need to consume a minimum of {{cvt|200|g|}} of the most theobromine-rich ({{cvt|5|g/kg|}}) dark chocolate, or a maximum of {{cvt|1|kg|}} (of theobromine-rich milk chocolate), to have a 50% chance of receiving a lethal dose. However, even {{cvt|40|g|}} of milk chocolate may induce vomiting and diarrhea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gwaltney-Brant |first1=Sharon |title=Chocolate Toxicosis in Animals |url=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/toxicology/food-hazards/chocolate-toxicosis-in-animals |website=Merck Veterinary Manual |publisher=Merck & Co., Inc. |access-date=24 December 2023}}</ref>
