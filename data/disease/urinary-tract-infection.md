==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Bladder Infection.png|thumb|Bladder infection]]
The [[bacteria]] that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or [[lymph]].<ref name=Sal2011/> It is believed that the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy.<ref name=Sal2011/> After gaining entry to the bladder, ''E. Coli'' are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a [[biofilm]] that resists the body's immune response.<ref name=Sal2011/>

''Escherichia coli'' is the single most common microorganism, followed by ''Klebsiella'' and [[Proteus (bacterium)|''Proteus'' spp.]], to cause urinary tract infection. ''Klebsiella'' and ''Proteus'' spp., are frequently associated with stone disease. The presence of Gram positive bacteria such as ''Enterococcus'' and ''Staphylococcus'' is increased.<ref name="Jorge Gutierrez-Aceves 2012 p. 39">{{cite book | vauthors = Gutierrez-Aceves J | chapter = Preoperative Antibiotics and Prevention of Sepsis in Genitourinary Surgery | veditors = Smith AD, Badlani GH, Preminger GM, Kavoussi LR |title=Smith's Textbook of Endourology |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-1-4443-4514-8 |edition=3rd | page = 39 }}</ref>

The increased resistance of urinary pathogens to [[quinolone antibiotic]]s has been reported worldwide and might be the consequence of overuse and misuse of quinolones.<ref name="Jorge Gutierrez-Aceves 2012 p. 39"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Bacteriuria pyuria 4.jpg|thumb|Multiple [[bacilli]] (rod-shaped bacteria, here shown as black and bean-shaped) shown between white blood cells in urinary microscopy. These changes are indicative of a urinary tract infection.]]
In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.<ref name=Review08/> In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via [[urinalysis]], looking for the presence of [[urinary nitrite]]s, [[white blood cells]] (leukocytes), or [[leukocyte esterase]].<ref name="Detweiler2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Detweiler K, Mayers D, Fletcher SG | title = Bacteruria and Urinary Tract Infections in the Elderly | journal = The Urologic Clinics of North America | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 561–568 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26475952 | doi = 10.1016/j.ucl.2015.07.002 | type = Review }}</ref> Another test, [[urine microscopy]], looks for the presence of [[red blood cells]], white blood cells, or bacteria.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> Urine [[microbiological culture|culture]] is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10<sup>3</sup> [[colony-forming unit]]s per mL of a typical urinary tract organism.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.<!-- <ref name=Review08/> --> However, women with negative cultures may still improve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=Review08/> As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.<ref name=Elder2011/>

===Based on pH===
Normal urine pH is slightly acidic, with usual values of 6.0 to 7.5, but the normal range is 4.5 to 8.0. A urine pH of 8.5 or 9.0 is indicative of a urea-splitting organism, such as Proteus, Klebsiella, or Ureaplasma urealyticum; therefore, an asymptomatic patient with a high pH means UTI regardless of the other urine test results. Alkaline pH also can signify struvite kidney stones, which are also known as "infection stones".<ref name=statspe>{{cite journal | title = Urinary Tract Infection | journal = Statpearls | date = 2020 | pmid = 29261874 | vauthors = Bono MJ, Leslie SW, Reygaert WC }} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=16 October 2017 }}.</ref>

===Classification===
A urinary tract infection may involve only the lower urinary tract, in which case it is known as a bladder infection. Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as pyelonephritis.<!-- <ref name=EM2011/> --> If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as [[asymptomatic bacteriuria]].<ref name=EM2011/> If a urinary tract infection involves the upper tract, and the person has [[diabetes mellitus]], is pregnant, is male, or [[immunocompromised]], it is considered complicated.<ref name=Sal2011/><ref name=AFP2011/> Otherwise if a woman is healthy and [[premenopausal]] it is considered uncomplicated.<ref name=AFP2011/> In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.<ref name=PeadsNA2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhat RG, Katy TA, Place FC | title = Pediatric urinary tract infections | journal = Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 637–653 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21782079 | doi = 10.1016/j.emc.2011.04.004 }}</ref>

===Children===
To make the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 10<sup>5</sup>{{nbsp}}CFU/mL is used for a "clean-catch" mid stream sample, 10<sup>4</sup>{{nbsp}}CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10<sup>2</sup>{{nbsp}}CFU/mL is used for [[suprapubic aspiration]]s (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle).<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> The use of "urine bags" to collect samples is discouraged by the [[World Health Organization]] due to the high rate of contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> Some, such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends [[renal ultrasound]] and [[voiding cystourethrogram]] (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection.<!-- <ref name=PeadsNA2011/> --> However, because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings.<ref name=PeadsNA2011/>

===Differential diagnosis===
