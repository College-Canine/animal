'''''Taenia pisiformis''''', commonly called the '''rabbit tapeworm''', is an [[endoparasite|endoparasitic]] [[tapeworm]] which causes infection in [[lagomorph]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[carnivore]]s. Adult ''T. pisiformis'' typically occur within the small intestines of the [[definitive host]]s, the carnivores. Lagomorphs, the [[intermediate hosts]], are infected by fecal contamination of grasses and other food sources by the definitive hosts. The larval stage is often referred to as ''Cysticercus pisiformis'' and is found on the livers and peritoneal cavities of the intermediate hosts.<ref name="Owiny2001">{{cite journal | title=Cysticercosis in laboratory rabbits | journal=Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science |date=March 2001  | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=45–48 | first1=J.R. | last1=Owiny| pmid=11300689 }}</ref> ''T. pisiformis'' can be found worldwide.

== Description ==

''T. pisiformis'' typically infect dogs and other carnivores such as [[coyote]]s and [[fox]]es. In rabbits, ''T. pisiformis'' larvae attach themselves to the liver and intestines, forming cysts {{convert|6|-|18|mm|lk=on|abbr=on}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Darzi|first1=M. M.|last2=Mir|first2=M.

The [[intermediate host]] is represented by [[hare]]s and [[rabbit]]s, in which are found the mesacestoide (the larval stage) known as cysticercus pisiformis. This is found in the peritoneum of the intermediate host and can be ingested by the definite host when the dog or cat feeds on the viscera of such an infected intermediate.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Life cycle==

Eggs are introduced into the environment through infected canine feces. In the feces are the gravid proglottids that house the ''T. pisiformis'' eggs that will eventually be released from the proglottid onto nearby vegetation. The eggs are then ingested by a rabbit or from any member of the ''[[Leporidae]]'' family. Once inside the rabbit's gut the larva or [[oncosphere]] phase will then penetrate into the intestinal wall until they reach the blood stream. When the worm reaches the liver the larva transforms into a cysticercus form. This cysticercus will stay in the liver for about two to four weeks, then move to the [[peritoneal cavity]] where it will wait for the definitive host to eat the rabbit. The definitive hosts are ether dogs or other members of the ''[[Canidae]]'' family. Once ingested the cysticercus finds its way into the intestine and attaches to the intestinal wall with hooks and suckers. After the worm has time to develop and grow in size, the gravid proglottids is released from the distal end of the parasite and passed in the feces to start a new cycle.<ref name="T. pisiformis life cycle">{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Jennifer|title=Taenia Pisiformis|url=http://www.geocities.ws/imetazoa/taenia.html|website=Taenia Pisiformis|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>

== Adult morphology ==

The adult stage consists of a [[scolex]] with four suckers and an armed rostellum, a short neck region, a series of immature [[Cestoda#Proglottids|proglottids]] with undeveloped reproductive organs, a series of mature proglottids with fully developed male and female reproductive organs, and a series of gravid proglottids with an expanded uterus filled with eggs.<ref name=Penn>{{cite web|title=Taenia pisiformis: Tapeworm|url=http://research.vet.upenn.edu/Hosts/Taeniapisiformis/tabid/7835/Default.aspx|website=Penn Veterinary Medicine D.V.E.I.|publisher=Diagnosis of Veterinary Endoparasitic Infections|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>

==Pathology==

In rabbits, there are not really defined clinical signs seen for any range of intensity except when there is an externally high intensity. In this case, rabbits look weak or ill. The major illness seen is signs of liver failure. In very few cases the cysts will migrate to the lungs or brain; these cases can cause breathing complication or seizures. In the most extreme cases, the rabbit will have sudden death.<ref name="med rabbit" />

For dogs, there are normally no clinical signs seen for low to moderate infections. In highly infected cases the dog will experience blockage in the intestines.<ref name=Penn /> In all cases the proglottids will be seen in the feces.

==Diagnostics==

When looking for signs of infection in the intermediate host or definitive host, the signs are not very externally seen. For the intermediate host there will be between two and 20 pea-sized cysts found inside the liver.<ref name=DNR>{{cite web|title=Cysticercosis|url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10370_12150_12220-26630--,00.html|website=Michigan Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> The cysts that are found have one scolex inverted to the middle of the cyst. This shape is called a ''cysticercus'', that is part of the ''metacestodes'' stage of life. The ones found in the liver form these bladders that are specifically called ''Cysticercus pisiformis'' for ''T. pisiformis''.<ref name="med rabbit">{{cite web|last1=Praag, Ph.D.|first1=Esther van|title=Taenia pisformis|url=http://www.medirabbit.com/EN/GI_diseases/Parasitic_diseases/tapeworm.htm|website=Flat worms: rabbit as an intermediate host|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> These signs can only be seen when a necropsy is done to the rabbit. When looking for an infection in dogs there is a more straightforward method. There will be gravid proglottids with striated eggs seen in the feces. This can be found using a fecal float on a sample that can easily be done by a vet.

==Treatment and prevention==

''Taenis pisiformis'' infection is very hard to treat in wild rabbits and canines, but it is easier to control pet infections. One way to stop the infection is to prevent dogs from eating wild rabbits or rodents. If the infected rabbit is not eaten then the worm cannot finish its life cycle. Household rabbits usually do not get infected if they are strictly indoor pets, but infection can happen if they are let outside into open grasses.

If the infection is already present then use one of these drugs: [[Epsiprantel]], [[Praziquantel]], [[Mebendazole]], [[Niclosamide]], Bunamindine hydrochloride or [[Fenbendazole]].<ref name="T. pisiformis life cycle" /> This will kill the adult stage but not the cyst or egg stage, so several treatments may be needed. Daily doses of Praziquantel for about one to two weeks' time will be effective against larval cysticercosis in rabbits. One dose of Niclosamide or Praziquantel can be very effective in dogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
