An '''eyelid''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ai|.|l|ɪ|d}} {{Respell|EYE|lid}}) is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects an [[eye]]. The [[levator palpebrae superioris muscle]] retracts the eyelid, exposing the cornea to the outside, giving vision. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily. "Palpebral" (and "blepharal") means relating to the eyelids. Its key function is to regularly spread the [[tears]] and other secretions on the eye surface to keep it moist, since the cornea must be continuously moist.  They keep the eyes from drying out when asleep.  Moreover, the [[blink]] reflex protects the eye from foreign bodies. A set of specialized hairs known as [[Eyelash|lashes]] grow from the upper and lower eyelid margins to further protect the eye from dust and debris.  

The appearance of the human upper eyelid often varies between different populations. The prevalence of an [[epicanthic fold]] covering the inner corner of the eye account for the majority of [[East Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian]] populations, and is also found in varying degrees among other populations. Separately, but also similarly varying between populations, the crease of the remainder of the eyelid may form either a "single eyelid", a "double eyelid", or an intermediate form.

Eyelids can be found in other animals, some of which may have a third eyelid, or [[nictitating membrane]]. A [[Human vestigiality|vestige of this in humans]] survives as the [[Plica semilunaris of conjunctiva|plica semilunaris]].

==Structure==
===Layers===
The eyelid is made up of several layers; from superficial to deep, these are: [[skin]], [[Subcutis|subcutaneous tissue]], [[Orbicularis oculi muscle|orbicularis oculi]], [[orbital septum]] and [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal plates]], and palpebral [[conjunctiva]]. The [[meibomian glands]] lie within the eyelid and secrete the lipid part of the [[tears|tear film]].

===Skin===
The skin is similar to areas elsewhere, but is relatively thin<ref name=Cecil /> and has more pigment cells.  In diseased persons, these may wander and cause a discoloration of the lids.  It contains sweat glands and hairs, the latter becoming eyelashes as the border of the eyelid is met.<ref>"eye, human." Encyclopædia Britannica. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]].  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.</ref> The skin of the eyelid contains the greatest concentration of [[sebaceous glands]] found anywhere in the body.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|date=25 July 2011|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1437727883|pages=2426|edition=24th}}</ref>

===Nerve supply===
In humans, the sensory nerve supply to the upper eyelids is from the [[infratrochlear]], [[supratrochlear]], [[supraorbital nerve|supraorbital]] and the [[lacrimal nerve]]s from the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (CN V). The skin of the lower eyelid is supplied by branches of the [[infratrochlear]] at the medial angle. The rest is supplied by branches of the [[infraorbital nerve]] of the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve.

===Blood supply===
In humans, the eyelids are supplied with blood by two arches on each upper and lower lid. The arches are formed by [[anastomoses]] of the [[lateral palpebral arteries]] and [[medial palpebral arteries]], branching off from the [[lacrimal artery]] and [[ophthalmic artery]], respectively.

=== Eyelashes ===
{{Main|Eyelash}}
[[File:Human eye, lateral view.jpg|thumb|Eyelashes grow from the eyelid margin and project outwards and curl away from the eye, to protect the eye from foreign objects]]
The [[Eyelash|eyelashes]] (or simply lashes) are hairs that grow on the edges of the upper and lower eyelids. The lashes are short (upper lashes are typically just 7 to 8 mm in length) hairs, though can be exceptionally long (occasionally up to 15 mm in length) and prominent in some individuals with [[trichomegaly]]. The lashes protect the eye from dust and debris by catching them via rapid [[blinking]] when the [[Corneal reflex|blink reflex]] is triggered by the debris touching the lashes. Long lashes also play a significant part in [[Physical attractiveness|facial attractiveness]].

==Function==
The eyelids close or blink voluntarily and involuntarily to protect the eye from foreign bodies, and keep the surface of the [[cornea]] moist. The upper and lower human eyelids feature a set of [[eyelash]]es which grow in up to 6 rows along each eyelid margin, and serve to heighten the protection of the eye from dust and foreign debris, as well as from perspiration.

==Clinical significance==
Any condition that affects the eyelid is called eyelid disorder. The most common eyelid disorders, their causes, symptoms and treatments are the following:

[[File:Stye02.jpg|thumb|right|Eyelid affected by [[stye]]]]
* '''Hordeolum''' ([[stye]]) is an infection of the [[sebaceous gland]]s of [[Gland of Zeis|Zeis]] usually caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' [[bacteria]], similar to the more common condition [[Acne vulgaris]]. It is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms and it appears similar to a red bump placed underneath the eyelid. The main symptoms of styes include pain, redness of the eyelid and sometimes swollen eyelids. Styes usually disappear within a week without treatment. Otherwise, [[antibiotic]]s may be prescribed and home remedies such as warm water compresses may be used to promote faster healing. Styes are normally harmless and do not cause long lasting damage.
* '''[[Chalazion]]''' (plural: '''chalazia''') is caused by the obstruction of the oil [[glands]] and can occur in both upper and lower eyelids. Chalazia may be mistaken for styes due to the similar symptoms. This condition is however less painful and it tends to be chronic. Chalazia heal within a few months if treatment is administered and otherwise they can resorb within two years. Chalazia that do not respond to topical medication are usually treated with surgery as a last resort.
* '''[[Blepharitis]]''' is the irritation of the lid margin, where eyelashes join the eyelid.  This is a common condition that causes inflammation of the eyelids and which is quite difficult to manage because it tends to recur.<ref name="Blepharitis">{{cite web |url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/blepharitis/blepharitis.asp |title=Facts About Blepharitis |access-date=2010-03-30 |archive-date=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414004836/http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/blepharitis/blepharitis.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> This condition is mainly caused by staphylococcus infection and scalp [[dandruff]]. Blepharitis symptoms include burning sensation, the feeling that there is something in the eye, excessive tearing, blurred vision, redness of the eye, light sensitivity, red and swollen eyelids, dry eye and sometimes crusting of the eyelashes on awakening. Treatment normally consists in maintaining a good hygiene of the eye and holding [[warm compresses]] on the affected eyelid to remove the crusts. Gently scrubbing the eyelid with the warm compress is recommended as it eases the healing process. In more serious cases, antibiotics may be prescribed.
* '''''[[Demodex]]'' mites''' are a genus of tiny mites that live as commensals in and around the [[hair follicle]]s of numerous mammals including humans, cats and dogs. Human demodex mites typically live in the follicles of the eyebrows and eyelashes. While normally harmless, human demodex mites can sometimes cause irritation of the skin ([[demodicosis]]) in persons with weakened immune systems.
* '''[[Entropion]]''' usually results from aging, but sometimes can be due to a [[congenital defect]], a spastic eyelid muscle, or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from surgery, injury, or disease.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2023}} It is an [[asymptomatic]] condition that can, rarely, lead to [[trichiasis]], which requires surgery. It mostly affects the lower lid, and is characterized by the turning inward of the lid, toward the [[eye|globe]].
* '''[[Ectropion]]''' is another aging-related eyelid condition that may lead to chronic eye irritation and scarring. It may also be the result of [[Allergy|allergies]] and its main symptoms are pain, excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva. 
* '''Laxity''' is also another aging-related eyelid condition that can lead to dryness and irritation.  Surgery may be necessary to repair the eyelid to its natural position.  In certain instances, excessive lower lid laxity creates the Fornix of Reiss – a pocket between the lower eyelid and globe – which is the ideal location to administer topical ophthalmic medications.
* '''Eyelid [[edema]]''' is a condition in which the eyelids are swollen and tissues contain excess fluid. It may affect eye function when it increases the intraocular pressure. Eyelid edema is caused by [[allergy]], [[trichiasis]] or infections.<ref name="Edema">{{cite web |url=http://www.uppereyelid.net/edema.html |title=Upper Eyelid Edema Treatment and Symptoms |access-date=2010-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315142647/http://www.uppereyelid.net/edema.html |archive-date=15 March 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The main symptoms are swollen red eyelids, pain, and itching.  Chronic eyelid edema can lead to [[blepharochalasis]].
* '''Eyelid [[tumor]]s''' may also occur. [[Basal cell carcinoma]]s are the most frequently encountered kind of cancer affecting the eyelid, making up 85% to 95% of all malignant eyelid tumors.<ref name="Tumors">{{cite web |url=http://www.eyecareamerica.org/eyecare/conditions/eye-tumors/index.cfm |title=Eyelid and Orbital Tumors |access-date=2010-03-30 }} {{cite web|url=http://www.cos-sco.ca/vision-health-information/conditions-disorders-treatments/eyelid-disorders/eyelid-orbital-tumours/|title=Eyelid and Orbital Tumours|access-date=2014-08-22|archive-date=26 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115326/http://www.cos-sco.ca/vision-health-information/conditions-disorders-treatments/eyelid-disorders/eyelid-orbital-tumours/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The tumors may be benign or malignant. Usually benign tumors are localized and removed before becoming a cancerous threat and before they become large enough to impair vision. Malignant tumors on the other hand tend to spread to surrounding areas and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].
* '''[[Blepharospasm]]''' (eyelid twitching) is an involuntary spasm of the eyelid muscle. The most common factors that make the muscle in the eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine.<ref name="Eyelid twitch">{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000756.htm |title=Eyelid twitch |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref> Eyelid twitching is not considered a harmful condition and therefore there is no treatment available. Patients are however advised to get more sleep and drink less caffeine.
* '''[[Eyelid dermatitis]]''' is the inflammation of the eyelid skin. It is mostly a result of allergies or contact dermatitis of the eyelid. Symptoms include dry and flaky skin on the eyelids and swollen eyelids. The affected eyelid may itch. Treatment consists in proper eye hygiene and avoiding the allergens that trigger the condition. In rare cases, [[topical cream]]s may be used but only under a doctor's supervision.
* '''[[Ptosis (eyelid)|Ptosis]]''' (drooping eyelid) is when the upper eyelid droops or sags due to weakness or paralysis of the levator muscle (responsible for raising the eyelid), or due to damage to nerves controlling the muscle. It can be a manifestation of the normal aging process, a congenital condition, or due to an injury or disease.  Risk factors related to ptosis include diabetes, stroke, Horner syndrome, Bell's Palsy (compression/damage to Facial nerve), myasthenia gravis, brain tumor or other cancers that can affect nerve or muscle function.
* '''Ablepharia''' (ablepharon) is the congenital absence of or reduction in the size of the eyelids.<ref>Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 21, Page-6.</ref>

===Surgery===
The eyelid surgeries are called [[blepharoplasty|blepharoplasties]] and are performed either for medical reasons or to alter one's facial appearance.

Most of the cosmetic eyelid surgeries are aimed to enhance the look of the face and to boost self-confidence by restoring a youthful eyelid appearance. They are intended to remove fat and excess skin that may be found on the eyelids after a certain age.

Eyelid surgeries are also performed to improve peripheral vision or to treat [[chalazion]], eyelid tumors, [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], extropion, [[trichiasis]], and other eyelid-related conditions.

Eyelid surgeries are overall safe procedures but they carry certain risks since the area on which the operation is performed is so close to the eye.

An [[anatomical variation]] in humans occurs in the creases and folds of the upper eyelid.

An [[epicanthic fold]], the skin fold of the upper eyelid covering the inner corner (medial [[canthus]]) of the eye, may be present based on various factors, including ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions. In some populations the trait is almost universal, specifically in East Asians and Southeast Asians, where a majority, up to 90% in some estimations, of adults have this feature.<ref name="Anchor">Lee, Y., Lee, E. and, Park, W.J.
