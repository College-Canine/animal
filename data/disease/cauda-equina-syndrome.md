<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Cauda equina syndrome''' ('''CES''') is a condition that occurs when the bundle of [[nerves]] below the end of the [[spinal cord]] known as the [[cauda equina]] is damaged.<ref name=NIH2015>{{cite web|title=Cauda equina syndrome|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10987/cauda-equina-syndrome|website=Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)|access-date=9 November 2017|language=en|date=2015}}</ref> Signs and symptoms include [[low back pain]], [[sciatica|pain that radiates down the leg]], numbness around the anus, and loss of bowel or bladder control.<ref name=Gar2011/> Onset may be rapid or gradual.<ref name=Gar2011/>

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
The cause is usually a [[disc herniation]] in the [[lumbar spine|lower region of the back]].<ref name=Gar2011/> Other causes include [[spinal stenosis]], [[cancer]], [[major trauma|trauma]], [[epidural abscess]], and [[epidural hematoma]].<ref name=Gar2011/><ref name=NIH2015/> The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by [[medical imaging]] such as [[MRI]] or [[CT scan]].<ref name=Gar2011/><ref name=AO2014>{{cite web|title=Cauda Equina Syndrome-OrthoInfo – AAOS|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00362|website=orthoinfo.aaos.org|access-date=9 November 2017|date=March 2014}}</ref>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
CES is generally treated surgically via [[laminectomy]].<ref name=Gar2011/> Sudden onset is regarded as a [[medical emergency]] requiring prompt [[surgical decompression]], with delay causing permanent loss of function.<ref name=":1" /> Permanent bladder problems, [[sexual dysfunction]] or numbness may occur despite surgery.<ref name=Gar2011/><ref name=AO2014/> A poor outcome occurs in about 20% of people despite treatment.<ref name=Gar2011/> About 1 in 70,000 people is affected every year.<ref name=Gar2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner A, Gardner E, Morley T | title = Cauda equina syndrome: a review of the current clinical and medico-legal position | journal = European Spine Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 690–7 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21193933 | pmc = 3082683 | doi = 10.1007/s00586-010-1668-3 }}</ref> It was first described in 1934.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chau AM, Xu LL, Pelzer NR, Gragnaniello C | title = Timing of surgical intervention in cauda equina syndrome: a systematic critical review | journal = World Neurosurgery | volume = 81 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 640–50 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24240024 | doi = 10.1016/j.wneu.2013.11.007 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Saddle anesthesia.png|thumb|Approximate area of "saddle anesthesia" seen from behind (yellow highlight)]]Signs and symptoms of cauda equina syndrome include:
* Severe back pain
* [[Saddle anesthesia]] (see diagram), i.e., [[anesthesia]] or [[paraesthesia]] involving [[Sacral spinal nerve 3|S3]] to [[Sacral spinal nerve 5|S5]] [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]]s,<ref name=Larner2006>{{cite book| vauthors = Larner AJ |title=A Dictionary of Neurological Signs|date=2006|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.|location=[New York]|isbn=9780387262147|edition=2nd}}</ref>{{rp|26}} including the [[perineum]], [[external genitalia]] and [[anus]]; or more descriptively, numbness or "pins-and-needles" sensations of the groin and inner thighs which would contact a saddle when riding a horse.
* Bladder and bowel dysfunction,<ref name=Kraemer2009 />{{rp|216}} caused by decreased tone of the urinary and anal sphincters. Detrusor weaknesses causing [[urine|urinary]] retention and post-void residual [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] as assessed by [[bladder scan]]ning the patient after the patient has [[urinated]].
* [[Sciatica]]-type pain on one side or both sides, although pain may be wholly absent
* Weakness of the muscles of the lower legs (often [[paraplegia]])
* [[Ankle jerk reflex|Achilles (ankle) reflex]] absent on both sides.<ref name=Kraemer2009>{{cite book |last=Kraemer |title=Intervertebral disk diseases causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis|date=2009|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783131495617|edition=3rd }}</ref>{{rp|216}}
* [[Sexual dysfunction]]
* Absent [[anal reflex]] and [[bulbocavernosus reflex]]
* [[Gait disturbance]]
Severe back pain, [[saddle anesthesia]], [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]] and [[sexual dysfunction]] are considered "red flags", i.e. features which require urgent investigation.<ref name=GARDNER2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner A, Gardner E, Morley T | title = Cauda equina syndrome: a review of the current clinical and medico-legal position | journal = European Spine Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 690–7 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21193933 | pmc = 3082683 | doi = 10.1007/s00586-010-1668-3 }}</ref>

==Causes==
After the [[conus medullaris]] (near lumbar vertebral levels 1 (L1) and 2 (L2), occasionally lower), the spinal canal contains a bundle of nerve fibers (the [[cauda equina]] or "horse-tail") that branches off the lower end of the spinal cord and contains the nerve roots from L1–L5 and S1–S5.  The nerve roots from L4–S4 join in the sacral plexus which affects the sciatic nerve, which travels caudally (toward the feet). Compression, trauma or other damage to this region of the spinal canal can result in cauda equina syndrome.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

The symptoms may also appear as a temporary side-effect of a sacral extra-dural injection.<ref name="Backache from Occiput to Coccyx Gerald L Burke, MD">{{Cite web |url=http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_8.html |title=Backache from Occiput to Coccyx |author=Gerald L Burke, MD |access-date=2014-07-23 |archive-date=2017-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817162016/http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_8.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Trauma===
Direct trauma can also cause cauda equina syndrome. Most common causes include as a complication of lumbar punctures, burst fractures resulting in posterior migration of fragments of the vertebral body, severe [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniations]], spinal anaesthesia involving trauma from catheters and high local anaesthetic concentrations around the cauda equina, [[penetrating trauma]] such as [[knife]] [[wound]]s or [[ballistic trauma]].<ref name="emed">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/cauda_equina_syndrome/article_em.htm#Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrome%20Causes |title=Cauda Equina Syndrome Causes |work=Cauda Equina Syndrome |first=Jason C |last=Eck | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[WebMD]] |access-date=25 April 2009 |date=11 May 2007}}</ref> Cauda equina syndrome may also be caused by [[blunt trauma]] suffered in an event such as a car accident or fall.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brian |date=2021-10-12 |title=What Is Cauda Equina Syndrome? |url=https://www.paulsoncoletti.com/what-is-cauda-equina-syndrome/ |access-date=2023-01-05 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Spinal stenosis===
CES can be caused by [[lumbar spinal stenosis]], which is when the diameter of the spinal canal narrows. This could be the result of a degenerative process of the spine (such as [[osteoarthritis]]) or a developmental defect which is present at birth. In the most severe cases of [[spondylolisthesis]] cauda equina syndrome can result.<ref name="emed"/>

===Inflammatory conditions===
Chronic spinal inflammatory conditions such as [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget disease]], [[neurosarcoidosis]], [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], rheumatoid disease of the spine, and chronic tuberculosis can cause it. This is due to the spinal canal narrowing that these kinds of syndromes can produce.<ref name="emed"/>

==Risk factors==
Individuals most at risk for [[disc herniation]] are the most likely to develop CES. Race has little influence with the notable exception that African Americans appear slightly less likely to develop CES than other groups.<ref name=Schoenfeld2012/><ref name=Radcliff2011/><ref name=Small2005/> Middle age also appears to be a notable risk factor, as those populations are more likely to develop a herniated disc; heavy lifting can also be inferred as a risk factor for CES.<ref name=Schoenfeld2012/><ref name=Small2005/>

Other risk factors include obesity and being female.<ref name=risk>{{cite journal | vauthors = Long B, Koyfman A, Gottlieb M | title = Evaluation and management of cauda equina syndrome in the emergency department | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–148 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31471075 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2019.158402 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MRI of the lumbar spine with abscess in the posterior epidural space, causing cauda equina syndrome.jpg|thumb|MRI of an abscess causing cauda equina syndrome]]

Diagnosis is first suspected clinically based on history and physical exam and usually confirmed by an [[MRI scan]] or [[CT scan]], depending on availability.<ref name=":1" /> Bladder scanning and loss of catheter sensation can also be used to evaluate bladder dysfunction in suspected cases of cauda equina syndrome and can aid diagnosis before MRI scanning.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Early surgery in acute onset of severe cases has been reported to be important.<ref name=":1" />

==Prevention==
Early diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome can allow for preventive treatment. Signs that allow early diagnosis include changes in bowel and bladder function and loss of feeling in groin.<ref name="emed2">{{cite web |title=Prevention |work=Cauda Equina Syndrome|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/cauda_equina_syndrome/page10_em.htm#Prevention |last=Eck |first=Jason C | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[WebMD]]|access-date=25 April 2009 |date=11 May 2007}}</ref> Changes in sensation can start as pins and needles leading to numbness. Changes in bladder function may be changes to stream or inability to fully empty the bladder. If a person progresses to full retention intervention is less likely to be successful.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Management==
The management of true cauda equina syndrome frequently involves surgical decompression. When cauda equina syndrome is caused by a herniated disk early surgical decompression is recommended.<ref name="herniation">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahn UM, Ahn NU, Buchowski JM, Garrett ES, Sieber AN, Kostuik JP | title = Cauda equina syndrome secondary to lumbar disc herniation: a meta-analysis of surgical outcomes | journal = Spine | volume = 25 | issue = 12 | pages = 1515–22 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10851100 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200006150-00010 | s2cid = 46674147 }}</ref>

Surgery may be required to remove blood, bone fragments, a tumor or tumors, a herniated disc or an abnormal bone growth. If the tumor cannot be removed surgically and is malignant then radiotherapy may be used as an alternative to relieve pressure. Chemotherapy can also be used for spinal neoplasms. If the syndrome is due to an inflammatory condition e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, anti-inflammatory, including steroids can be used as an effective treatment. If a bacterial infection is the cause then an appropriate course of antibiotics can be used to treat it.<ref name="EMIS">{{cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Cauda-Equina-Syndrome.htm |title=Cauda Equina Syndrome |last=Tidy |first=Colin |name-list-style=vanc |date=16 Nov 2009 |publisher=[[Egton Medical Information Systems]] |access-date=11 January 2010 |archive-date=23 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123051745/http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Cauda-Equina-Syndrome.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Cauda equina syndrome can occur during pregnancy due to lumbar disc herniation. The risk of cauda equina syndrome during pregnancy increases with age of the mother. Surgery can still be performed and pregnancy does not adversely affect treatment. Treatment for those with cauda equina can and should be carried out at any time during pregnancy.<ref name="pregnancy">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MD, Levi AD | title = Surgery for lumbar disc herniation during pregnancy | journal = Spine | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 440–3 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11224893 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200102150-00022 | s2cid = 31698755 }}</ref>

Lifestyle issues may need to be addressed post-treatment. Issues could include the person's need for physiotherapy and occupational therapy due to lower limb dysfunction. [[Obesity]] might also need to be tackled.<ref name="EMIS"/>

===Bowel and bladder control===
Rehabilitation of CES depends on the severity of the injury. If permanent damage occurs, then impairment in bladder and bowel control may result.<ref name="Bladdder_Bowel">{{cite web|title=Cauda Equina|url=https://www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org/cauda-equina-2/|website=Cauda equina - Bladder and Bowel Community|publisher=Bladder and Bowel Support Company Limited|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116182620/https://www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org/cauda-equina-2/|archive-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> Once surgery is performed, resting is required until the bladder and bowel dysfunction can be assessed. [[Urinary catheterization]] may help with bladder control. Gravity and exercise can help control bowel movement (Hodges, 2004). [[Pelvic floor exercise]]s assist in controlling [[bowel movements]] (Pelvic Floor Exercises, 2010).{{full citation needed|date=May 2013}} These exercises can be done standing, lying, or on all fours with the knees slightly separated. Full recovery of bowel and bladder control can take as long as two years.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for complete recovery is dependent upon many factors. The most important of these is the severity and duration of compression upon the damaged nerve(s). Generally, the longer the time before intervention to remove the compression causing nerve damage, the greater the damage caused to the nerve(s).{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Damage can be so severe that nerve regrowth is impossible, and the nerve damage will be permanent. In cases where the nerve has been damaged but is still capable of regrowth, recovery time is widely variable. Surgical intervention with decompression of the cauda equina can assist recovery. Delayed or severe nerve damage can mean up to several years' recovery time because nerve growth is exceptionally slow.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Review of the literature indicates that around 50–70% of patients have urinary retention (CES-R) on presentation with 30–50% having an incomplete syndrome (CES-I). The latter group, especially if the history is less than a few days, usually requires emergency MRI to confirm the diagnosis followed by prompt decompression. CES-I with its more favourable prognosis may become CES-R at a later stage.<ref name="pmid21193933">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner A, Gardner E, Morley T | title = Cauda equina syndrome: a review of the current clinical and medico-legal position | journal = European Spine Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 690–7 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21193933 | pmc = 3082683 | doi = 10.1007/s00586-010-1668-3 }}</ref>
