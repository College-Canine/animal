== Contraindications ==
[[Acute intermittent porphyria]], hypersensitivity to any barbiturate, prior dependence on barbiturates, severe [[respiratory insufficiency]] (as with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]), severe [[liver failure]], pregnancy, and breastfeeding are contraindications for phenobarbital use.<ref name=":0" />

== Overdose ==
{{Main|Barbiturate overdose}}

Phenobarbital causes a depression of the body's systems, mainly the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s. Thus, the main characteristic of phenobarbital overdose is a "slowing" of bodily functions, including decreased [[consciousness]] (even [[coma]]), [[bradycardia]], [[bradypnea]], [[hypothermia]], and [[hypotension]] (in massive overdoses). Overdose may also lead to [[pulmonary edema]] and [[acute renal failure]] as a result of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and can result in death.

The [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) of a person with phenobarbital overdose may show a marked decrease in electrical activity, to the point of mimicking [[brain death]]. This is due to profound depression of the central nervous system and is usually reversible.<ref name="Habal">{{cite web| url = http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic207.htm| title = Barbiturate Toxicity| access-date = 2006-09-14| vauthors = Habal R | date = 2006-01-27| work = eMedicine| publisher = WebMD| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720013401/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic207.htm| archive-date = 2008-07-20}}</ref>

Treatment of phenobarbital overdose is [[Supportive care|supportive]], and mainly consists of the maintenance of [[airway]] patency (through [[endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]]), correction of bradycardia and hypotension (with [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and [[vasopressor]]s, if necessary), and removal of as much drug as possible from the body. In very large overdoses, multi-dose activated charcoal is a mainstay of treatment as the drug undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Urine alkalization (achieved with sodium bicarbonate) enhances renal excretion. [[Hemodialysis]] is effective in removing phenobarbital from the body and may reduce its half-life by up to 90%.<ref name="Habal" /> No specific antidote for barbiturate poisoning is available.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |title= Barbiturate intoxication and overdose |access-date= 15 July 2008 |publisher= MedLine Plus |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081001212130/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |archive-date= 1 October 2008 }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Phenobarbital is as an [[allosteric modulator]] which extends the amount of time the chloride ion channel is open by interacting with [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] subunits. Through this action, phenobarbital increases the flow of [[chloride]] ions into the neuron which decreases the excitability of the [[Postsynaptic neuron|post-synaptic neuron]]. [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|Hyperpolarizing]] this post-synaptic membrane leads to a decrease in the general excitatory aspects of the post-synaptic neuron. By making it harder to [[Depolarization|depolarize]] the neuron, the [[Action potential threshold|threshold for the action potential]] of the post-synaptic neuron will be increased. Phenobarbital stimulates GABA to accomplish this hyperpolarization.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis CB, Adams N | chapter = Phenobarbital |date=2019| chapter-url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532277/ | title = StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=30335310|access-date=2019-03-27 }}</ref> Direct blockade of excitatory [[glutamate]] signaling is also believed to contribute to the hypnotic/anticonvulsant effect that is observed with the barbiturates.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brust JC | chapter = Alcohol and the nervous system – Chapter 8 – Acute withdrawal: diagnosis and treatment|date=2014| title = Handbook of Clinical Neurology |volume=125 |pages=123–131 |publisher=Elsevier |language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-62619-6.00008-2 |pmid=25307572 |isbn=9780444626196}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Phenobarbital has an oral [[bioavailability]] of about 90%. [[Peak plasma concentration]]s (C<sub>max</sub>) are reached eight to 12 hours after oral administration. It is one of the longest-acting barbiturates available – it remains in the body for a very long time (half-life of two to seven days) and has very low [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]] (20 to 45%). Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver, mainly through [[hydroxylation]] and [[glucuronidation]] and induces many [[isozyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450 system]]. Cytochrome P450 2B6 ([[CYP2B6]]) is specifically induced by phenobarbital via the [[Constitutive androstane receptor|CAR]]/[[Retinoid X receptor|RXR]] [[nuclear receptor]] [[heterodimer]]. It is excreted primarily by the [[kidney]]s.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Flynn S, Babi MA |title=Pharmacology and Therapeutics for Dentistry |date=2017 |pages=176–192 |chapter=Chapter 12: Anticonvulsants |publisher=Elsevier |language=en |doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-39307-2.00012-6 |isbn=9780323393072 }}</ref>

== History ==
The first barbiturate drug, [[barbital]], was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists [[Emil Fischer]] and [[Joseph von Mering]] and was first marketed as Veronal by [[Bayer|Friedr. Bayer et comp]]. By 1904, several related drugs, including phenobarbital, had been synthesized by Fischer. Phenobarbital was brought to market in 1912 by the drug company [[Bayer]] as the brand Luminal. It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of [[benzodiazepine]]s in the 1960s.<ref name="Sneader2005">{{cite book| vauthors = Sneader W | title = Drug Discovery| date=  2005-06-23| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 978-0-471-89979-2| page = 369}}</ref>

Phenobarbital's soporific, sedative and hypnotic properties were well known in 1912, but it was not yet known to be an effective anti-convulsant. The young doctor [[Alfred Hauptmann]]<ref>{{cite web |url  = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2764.html |title = Alfred Hauptmann |access-date = 2006-09-06 | vauthors = Enersen OD |url-status = live |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109210437/http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2764.html |archive-date = 2006-11-09 }}</ref> gave it to his epilepsy patients as a [[tranquilizer]] and discovered their seizures were susceptible to the drug. Hauptmann performed a careful study of his patients over an extended period. Most of these patients were using the only effective drug then available, [[potassium bromide|bromide]], which had terrible side effects and limited efficacy. On phenobarbital, their epilepsy was much improved: The worst{{unclear-inline|date=July 2022}} patients had fewer and lighter seizures and some patients became seizure-free. In addition, they improved physically and mentally as bromides were removed from their regimen. Patients who had been institutionalised due to the severity of their epilepsy were able to leave and, in some cases, resume employment. Hauptmann dismissed concerns that its effectiveness in stalling seizures could lead to patients developing a build-up that needed to be "discharged". As he expected, withdrawal of the drug led to an increase in seizure frequency – it was not a cure. The drug was quickly adopted as the first widely effective anti-convulsant, though [[World War I]] delayed its introduction in the U.S.<ref name="Scott1993">{{cite book| vauthors = Scott DF | title = The History of Epileptic Therapy| date = 1993-02-15| publisher = Taylor & Francis| isbn = 978-1-85070-391-4| pages = 59–65}}</ref>

In 1939, a German family asked [[Adolf Hitler]] to have their disabled son killed; the five-month-old boy was given a lethal dose of Luminal after Hitler sent his own doctor to examine him. A few days later 15 psychiatrists were summoned to Hitler's Chancellery and directed to commence a clandestine program of [[involuntary euthanasia]].<ref>{{cite news| vauthors = Zoech I |title=Named: the baby boy who was Nazis' first euthanasia victim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1443967/Named-the-baby-boy-who-was-Nazis-first-euthanasia-victim.html |access-date=1 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 October 2003|quote=The case was to provide the rationale for a secret Nazi decree that led to 'mercy killings' of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people.

In 1940, at a clinic in [[Ansbach]], Germany, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at Feuchtwanger&nbsp;Strasse 38, although a newer plaque does not mention that patients were killed using barbiturates on site.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Kaelber L |title=Kinderfachabteilung Ansbach |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/ansbach/ansbach.html |work=Sites of Nazi "Children's 'Euthanasia'" Crimes and Their Commemoration in Europe|publisher=University of Vermont|access-date=1 November 2013|date=8 March 2013|quote=In the late 1980s, important developments occurred at the clinic that led to the first publication on the subject and the display of two plaques. Dr Reiner Weisenseel wrote his dissertation under Dr Athen, then the director of the Ansbacher Bezirkskrankenhaus, on the involvement of the clinic in Euthanasia crimes, including the operation of the Kinderfachabteilung. In 1988 two members of the Green Party as well as the regional diet (Bezirkstag) were horrified to find portraits of physicians involved in Nazi euthanasia crimes among the honorary display of medical personnel in the administrative building, and they successfully petitioned to have these portraits removed. Since 1992 a plaque hangs in the entry hall way of the administrative building. It reads: 'In the Third Reich the Ansbach facility delivered to their death more than 2000 of the patients entrusted to it as life unworthy of living: They were transferred to killing facilities or starved to death. In their own way many people incurred responsibility.' It continues: 'Half a century later full of shame we commemorate the victims and call to remember the Fifth Commandment.' The killing of children ''specifically transferred to the clinic to be murdered'' is not noted. The plaque does not address that that euthanasia victims were not only starved or transported to gassing facilities but killed using barbiturates on site.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103075613/http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/ansbach/ansbach.html|archive-date=3 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Binder J | title = Die Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach während des Nationalsozialismus | url = http://www.bezirksklinikum-ansbach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Ansbach/BklMfr_Flyer_61_AN_Gedenkorte_DRUCK_neu.pdf | work = Bezirksklinikum Ansbach | publisher = Bezirkskliniken Mittelfranken | access-date = 1 November 2013 | language = de | date = October 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130325/http://www.bezirksklinikum-ansbach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Ansbach/BklMfr_Flyer_61_AN_Gedenkorte_DRUCK_neu.pdf | archive-date = 3 November 2013 }}</ref> Luminal was used in the Nazi [[Child euthanasia in Nazi Germany|children's euthanasia program]] until at least 1943.<ref>{{cite web| vauthors = Kaelber L |title=Jewish Children with Disabilities and Nazi "Euthanasia" Crimes|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/leipzigdoesen/bull2013-Kaelber1.pdf|work=The Bulletin of the Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies|publisher=University of Vermont|access-date=1 November 2013|date=Spring 2013|quote=Two Polish physicians reported at the time that 235 children from ages up to 14 were listed in the booklet, of whom 221 had died.
