The name ''dachshund'' is of German [[word origin|origin]], and means 'badger dog', from {{wikt-lang|de|Dachs}} ('badger') and {{wikt-lang|de|Hund}} ('dog, hound'). The German word ''Dachshund'' is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈdaks.hʊnt||De-Dachshund.ogg}}. The pronunciation varies in English: variations of the first and second [[syllable]]s include {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|k|s|-}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|k|s|-}} and {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|t}}, {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|d}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ən|d}}. It may be incorrectly pronounced as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|ʃ|-}}''hound'' by some English speakers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/560280/right-way-pronounce-dachshund|title=The Right Way to Pronounce 'Dachshund'|date=2018-10-14|website=mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dog-breeds-youre-probably-mispronouncing-2018-4|title=7 dog breeds you're probably mispronouncing|last=Stiefvater|first=Sarah|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> Although {{lang|de|Dachshund}} is a German word, in modern Germany, the dogs are more commonly known by the short name {{lang|de|Dackel}}.

Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener or sausage dog.<ref>{{cite web |title=wiener dog |url=https://www.oed.com/dictionary/wiener-dog_n?tab=meaning_and_use#991261039430 |website=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University |access-date=30 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=sausage dog |url=https://www.oed.com/dictionary/sausage-dog_n?tab=meaning_and_use#9924318889 |website=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University |access-date=30 January 2024}}</ref>

== Classification ==
While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its own group in the countries which belong to the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (World Canine Federation).<ref>{{cite web|title=Fédération Cynologique Internationale Group 4 "Dachshund Group"|url=http://old.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&file=group4|work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale|access-date=16 June 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815103443/http://old.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&file=group4|archive-date=15 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance similar to  the [[terrier]] group of dogs.<ref name="Nicholas">{{cite book | last = Nicholas | first = Anna | title = Dachshund | publisher = TFH Publications | location = Neptune City | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-86622-158-1 | page = [https://archive.org/details/dachshund0000nich/page/10 10] | url = https://archive.org/details/dachshund0000nich/page/10 }}</ref> An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the [[Saint Hubert Hound]] like many modern scent hound breeds such as [[bloodhound]]s and [[Basset Hound]]s; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the [[terrier]], or "earth dog", group.<ref name="Nicholas" />

== Characteristics ==

=== Appearance ===
[[File:Dachshund.jpg|thumb|A wire-haired dachshund]]
A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. Its [[snout]] is long.<ref name="AKC Standards">{{cite web |title=American Kennel Club Official Standard of the Dachshund |url=https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Dachshund.pdf |work=akc.org |access-date=11 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143635/https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Dachshund.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Coat and color ====
[[File:Trixie the red haired dachshund.png|thumb|A redhaired miniature dachshund]]
There are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), long-haired, and wire-haired.<ref name="gkpnso" /> Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wire-haired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.<ref name="gkpnso" />
Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or [[Isabelline (colour)|isabella]] and tan), and in wire-haired dogs, a color referred to as wildboar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents.

The Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) consider Double Dapple to be out of standard and a disqualifying color in the show ring. Piebald is now a recognized color in the Dachshund Club of America (DCA) breed standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dachshundclubofamerica.org/breed-standard/|publisher=Dachshund Club of America|title=Breed standard|date=13 March 2014 |access-date=2024-02-22}}</ref>

Dogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording "double-dapple" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording "dapple" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/pets/dogs/what-to-know-about-dachshunds|title=What to Know About Dachshunds|publisher=Webmd|access-date=2024-02-22}}</ref>

==== Size ====
[[File:Dachshund doggy, Taipei, Taiwan (8566591759).jpg | thumb|220x124px | right | A golden haired dachshund]]
Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,<ref name="gkpnso">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=3 February 2009}}</ref> and ''kaninchen'' (German for "rabbit"). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fédération Cynologique Internationale Official Website |url=http://www.fci.be/default.aspx |work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale |access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref> An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size; these are frequently referred to as "tweenies," which is not an official classification.

A full-grown standard dachshund typically weighs {{convert|16|lb|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}} to {{convert|32|lb|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}}, while the miniature variety normally weighs less than {{convert|12|lb|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name="gkpnso" /> The kaninchen weighs {{convert|8|lb|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}} to {{convert|11|lb|round=0.5|abbr=on|order=flip}}. According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well.<ref name="gkpnso" /> While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.<ref>{{cite book |title=For the Love of Dachshunds| last=Hutchinson |first=Robert  |year=2005 |publisher=BrownTrout Publishers |isbn=1-56313-903-0 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_XAakNgDJwC&pg=PA14 |access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

==== Eye color ====

[[File:Red piebald dox miniature long hair.jpg|thumb|Red piebald long-haired miniature dachshund puppy]]
Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. Dapple and double dapple dachshunds can have multi-coloured "wall" eyes with fully blue, partially blue or patched irises due to the effect of the dapple gene on eye pigmentation expression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dachshund.org/article_double_dapple.html |title=The Double Dapple |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |access-date=25 June 2007}}</ref>  "Wall" eye is permissible according to DCA standards but undesirable by AKC standards. 

=== Temperament ===
Dachshunds can be stubborn and refuse commands, especially if chasing a small animal which they have a propensity for.<ref name=Stall>{{cite book|last = Stall|first = Sam|title = The Good, the Bad, and the Furry|pages = [https://archive.org/details/goodbadfurrychoo0000stal/page/93 93–94]|publisher = Quirk Books|year = 2005|isbn = 1-59474-021-6|url = https://archive.org/details/goodbadfurrychoo0000stal/page/93}}</ref><ref name=paws>{{cite book|last1 = Kilcommons|first1 = Brian|author-link1 = Brian Kilcommons|last2 = Wilson|first2 = Sarah|title = Paws to Consider|pages = [https://archive.org/details/pawstoconsiderch00kilc/page/156 156–157]|isbn = 0-446-52151-5|url = https://archive.org/details/pawstoconsiderch00kilc/page/156|year = 1999| publisher=Warner Books }}</ref><ref name=ADR>{{cite web|title = Dachshund info|url = http://www.albertadachshundrescue.com/dachshundinfo.cfm|access-date = 25 July 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090418212636/http://albertadachshundrescue.com/dachshundinfo.cfm|archive-date = 18 April 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref> As dachshunds were originally used as badger hunters they have a keen sense for chasing smaller animals.

According to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, "the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed.

A 2008 [[University of Pennsylvania]] study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be "genetically predisposed toward aggressive behaviour". Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dobson |first=Roger |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2254479/Sausage-dogs-are-the-most-aggressive-dogs.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2254479/Sausage-dogs-are-the-most-aggressive-dogs.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title= Sausage dogs are the most aggressive dogs |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=8 July 2008 |access-date=19 November 2009 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered "dilution" genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant "dilution" genes can cancel each other out, or "cross", removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherlysdachshunds.com/genes.html |title=Recessive and Dominant Genes|work=Weatherly's Miniature Dachshunds| access-date=19 November 2009}}</ref> When occurring genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be detrimental to development, causing hearing or vision problems.

Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to [[Canine follicular dysplasia#Color dilution alopecia|color dilution alopecia]], a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun.

== History ==
[[File:olddachshund.jpg|thumb|An old-style dachshund showing the longer legs]]
[[File:Deiker Jagdbare Tiere 1093210.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a dachshund baying a [[European badger]]]]

The dachshund is a creation of German [[Dog breeding|breeders]] and includes elements of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], and [[England|English]] hounds and [[terrier]]s. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who was particularly enamored of the breed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dachshund History Queen Victoria |url=http://smalldogbreedsinformation.com/dachshund/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140531034424/http://smalldogbreedsinformation.com/dachshund/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 May 2014 |work=Dachshund History Sub Category |access-date=3 May 2014 }}</ref>{{unreliable source|date=January 2024}}

The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the "'''Dachs Kriecher'''" ("badger crawler") or "'''Dachs Krieger'''" ("badger warrior"), came from books written in the early 18th century.<ref>Der vollkommene teutsche Jäger (The Complete German Hunter), Johann Friedrich von Flemming, 1719–1724, Leipzig.</ref> Prior to that, there exist references to "badger dogs" and "hole dogs", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between {{convert|14|and|18|kg|abbr=on|lbs}}, and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and [[badger-baiting]], dachshunds were also commonly used for [[rabbit]] and [[fox]] hunting, for locating wounded [[deer]], and in packs were known to hunt game as large as [[wild boar]] and as fierce as the [[wolverine]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 14, 1875|title=THE CHAMPION DACHSHUND, MANN|journal=Forest and Stream; A Journal of Outdoor Life, Travel, Nature Study, Shooting, Fishing, Yachting (1873–1930)|pages=149|via=ProQuest}}</ref>

There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of hunting badger, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

Double-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.easypetmd.com/doginfo/dachshund|title=Dachshund Breed Information: History, Health, Pictures, and more|website=www.easypetmd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327023802/http://www.easypetmd.com/doginfo/dachshund|archive-date=27 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dachshundbreedcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dach-facts-dapple1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327023841/https://dachshundbreedcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dach-facts-dapple1.pdf |archive-date=2018-03-27 |url-status=live|title=Dach-Facts: Double Dapple Health Risks|website=www.dachshundbreedcouncil.org.uk}}</ref>

The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the [[ear canal]]. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.<ref name="AHR">{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Adverd|title=A Brief History of the Breed|url=https://twodogzoo.com/brief-history-of-dachshund-breed/|access-date=28 October 2009|work=TwoDogZoo.com}}</ref>{{unreliable source|date=January 2024}}
The smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the [[German Shorthaired Pointer]], a [[Pinscher]], and a Bracke (a type of [[bloodhound]]), or to have been produced by crossing a short [[Bruno Jura Hound]] with a pinscher.<ref name="DCA">{{cite web|title=History and Development |url=http://www.dachshund-dca.org/faq.html#development |work=Dachshund Club of America |access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref> Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that it was developed from the [[Bloodhound|St. Hubert Hound]], also a bloodhound, in the 18th century,<ref name="5star">{{cite web |title=Dachshund Dog Breed Origins |url=http://www.5stardog.com/dog-breeds-dachshund.asp |work=5StarDog |access-date=16 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909152551/http://www.5stardog.com/dog-breeds-dachshund.asp |archive-date=9 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and still others believe that they were descended from [[Basset Hound]]s, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance.<ref name="Sheilds">{{cite book|editor-last= Shields |editor-first= George O. |title= The American Book of the Dog |last= Loeffler |first= William |chapter=Dachshunds | pages= 217–239 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14JCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA217 |publisher= Cassell and Co |location= University of California |year= 1891}}</ref> 

The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from '' The American Book of the Dog (1891)'', in the chapter on dachshunds: "The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed."<ref name="Sheilds" /> What can be agreed on, however, is that the smooth dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

There are two theories about how the standard long-haired dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced long-haired offspring, and the long-haired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard long-haired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the [[German Spaniel|German Stoeberhund]], and the smooth dachshund.<ref name="DCA" />

The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the [[Schnauzer]], the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]], the [[German Wirehaired Pointer]], or perhaps the [[Scottish Terrier]].<ref name="DCA" />

== Symbol of Germany ==
Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. [[Political cartoon]]ists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule Germany.<ref>{{cite news|title=Political Cartoon for War Bonds |work=The New York Times |date=5 April 1943}}</ref> During [[World War I]], the dachshund's popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. As a result, they were often called "liberty hounds", just as "liberty cabbage" became a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sort of Life |last=Green |first=Graham |pages=49 |url=http://richardshepherd.net/2006/ClaudiasSunangel.html}}</ref> The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during [[World War II]], though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and German field marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] were known for keeping dachshunds.

Due to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich at the time, the dachshund was chosen as the first official [[mascot]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, with the name [[Waldi]].<ref name="higher">{{cite web |url=http://www.swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php |title=Meet the Mascots: Waldi (Munich 1972) |author=Whelliston, Kyle |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=Swifter Higher |access-date=7 January 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308075540/http://swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php

== Sports ==
[[File:Short haired dachshund in race.jpg|thumb|A smooth dachshund in an organized race]]
Some people train and enter their dachshunds to compete in [[Dachshund racing|dachshund races]], such as the [[Wiener Nationals]]. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mercker |first=Jan |date=19 September 2017 |title=Short on Legs, Long on Competition: It's the 2017 Wiener Dog Races |url=https://loudounnow.com/2017/09/19/short-on-legs-long-on-competition-its-the-2017-wiener-dog-races/ |website=Loudoun Now}}</ref>

Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes "wiener racing", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is [[earthdog trial]]s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate either an artificial bait or live but caged (and thus protected) rats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earthdog Den Trials |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/clubs/earthdog.htm |access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

== ''Dackel'' versus ''Teckel'' ==
In Germany, dachshunds are widely called ''Dackel'' (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as ''Teckel''. There are [[kennel]]s which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called ''jagdliche Leistungszucht'' ("hunting-related performance breeding") or ''Gebrauchshundezucht'' ("working dog breeding"), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore, it is sometimes incorrectly believed that ''Teckel'' is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called "VGP", "Verband-Gebrauchsprüfung") in Germany.<ref name="dtk">[http://www.dtk1888.de/fragen.html FAQ of the German Teckelclub on the naming issue] (in German)</ref>

==Popularity==
Dachshunds are one of the most popular dogs in the United States, ranking 12th in the 2018 AKC registration statistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/ |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=2 December 2022}}</ref> They are popular with urban and apartment dwellers, ranking among the top 10 most popular breeds in 76 of 190 major US cities surveyed by the AKC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/register/top-dogs-by-city/ |title=2006 AKC Top Breeds By City |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=24 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218194740/http://www.akc.org/register/top-dogs-by-city/ |archive-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
